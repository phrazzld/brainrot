# T282: Fix BlobService Tests - Completion Report

## Task Summary
The task was to fix URL configuration issues in BlobService.test.ts to ensure proper test environment setup. This was a critical task for the CI/PR branch.

## Implementation Details

I converted the TypeScript-based `BlobService.test.ts` to a JavaScript implementation to avoid ESM/TypeScript compatibility issues. This followed the pattern established in previous tasks (T280, T281).

The key implementation changes were:

1. **Converted to JavaScript**: Moved from TypeScript to JavaScript to avoid ESM compatibility issues.

2. **Added Proper Environment Management**:
   - Added explicit setup of `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL` in `beforeEach`
   - Added cleanup of environment variables in `afterEach`
   - Ensured isolated tests by properly resetting mocks between test runs

3. **Improved Mocking**:
   - Added proper mocks for `File` and `Blob` constructors
   - Added proper mock for `global.fetch`
   - Ensured all mocks are consistent with the actual implementation

4. **Fixed Test Structure**:
   - Maintained consistent test structure: Arrange, Act, Assert
   - Maintained the same test cases and assertions from the original test
   - Added proper error handling tests

5. **URL Handling Improvements**:
   - Ensured URL tests properly handle environment variables
   - Added tests for various URL patterns and edge cases
   - Verified URL generation with and without query parameters

## Testing Results
The converted BlobService.test.js passes all tests and properly handles URLs in different configurations. The key test sections include:

- uploadFile: 4 tests passing
- uploadText: 2 tests passing
- listFiles: 2 tests passing
- getFileInfo: 1 test passing
- deleteFile: 1 test passing
- getUrlForPath: 6 tests passing (primary focus of URL configuration)
- fetchText: 3 tests passing

## Lessons Learned

1. **JavaScript vs. TypeScript for Tests**: Converting to JavaScript simplifies testing when dealing with ESM modules, particularly for functions that use browser-specific APIs.

2. **Environment Variable Management**: Proper setup and teardown of environment variables is crucial for tests that rely on environment configuration.

3. **URL Generation Testing**: The main issue was in the handling of environment variables for URL generation. Tests should verify behavior with and without environment variables set.

4. **Mocking Browser APIs**: Proper mocking of browser APIs like `File`, `Blob`, and `fetch` is essential for testing code that uses these APIs.

## Next Steps

With the BlobService tests fixed, the next steps would be:

1. Address the failing tests in reading-room-blob.test.tsx, which are related to component testing
2. Create a simple test component to verify React Testing Library setup

All tests in the utils/services directory are now passing, which was the primary goal of this task.
