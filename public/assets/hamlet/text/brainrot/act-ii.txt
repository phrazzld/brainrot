ACT II

SCENE I. A ROOM IN POLONIUS’S HOUSE.

[ENTER POLONIUS AND REYNALDO.]

POLONIUS. slide him this cash and these notes, reynaldo.

REYNALDO. bet, my lord.

POLONIUS. you gon’ handle it mad smartly, good reynaldo—before you pull up on him, scope out his whole vibe and tea.

REYNALDO. my lord, that’s exactly the plan.

POLONIUS. bet, well said; real fire words. yo, first scope out what danish peeps are posted in paris—like, who they are, how they stunt, where they crash, what squad they rep, and who's frontin’ the bill; and once you spin that full deets round, you’ll peep that they’re lowkey tight with my son—then you can slide in closer than your extra demands. think of it like, “i know his dad and his crew, and kinda him”—catch my drift, reynaldo?

REYNALDO. ay, mad vibes, my lord.

POLONIUS. you might be like, “i know him in part, but not deep,” but if we talk about him, he’s hella wild—lowkey addicted to this and that; and then you can flex whatever made-up dirt you want on him—just keep it chill enough not to trash his rep; but, bro, stick to the usual wild and free moves that come with youth.

REYNALDO. like gaming, my lord?

POLONIUS. exactly—could be gaming, be sippin’, fencing, cursing, beefin’, hooking up—feel free to go there.

REYNALDO. my lord, that’d totally put him in major L’s.

POLONIUS. nah fam, just season it right in your report. you can’t load him up with another scandal that makes him look like he’s trippin’ on impulse—that’s not the vibe. just paint his slip-ups as the natural stains of liberty; a burst of that fiery mind, raw savage energy in his blood—a wild outburst, nothing more.

REYNALDO. but my good lord—

POLONIUS. why you even tryna do that?

REYNALDO. ay, my lord, i’m tryna peep that.

POLONIUS. look, here’s the drift—and i’m convinced it’s solid. when you drop these light dirt bits on my son, like it’s just a little smear on his rep, listen—when you chop it up with his squad, if you’ve clocked those so-called shady vibes, be sure he’s linking with you in return; expect him to hit you with a “good sir,” or “friend,” or even “gentleman”—depending on the flavor.

REYNALDO. hella good, my lord.

POLONIUS. and then, sir, does he do this—he does—what was i sayin’? damn, i was about to drop something. where was i?

REYNALDO. at “closes in the consequence.” like, when he rolls up with “friend or so” and “gentleman.”

POLONIUS. exactly—he links with you like, “i know the gentleman, i peeped him yesterday or the other day, or then—with such and such; and, like you said, he was gaming, got lit in the ruckus, even clashed over tennis” or maybe even, “i saw him roll into a sketchy spot”—a brothel, or whatever. see that? your fabricated deets are reeling in a real truth carp; and that’s how we, the savvy crew, use our sneaky hacks and biased probes to uncover the real tea. so, based on my previous 411, you’ll school my son. you got me, right?

REYNALDO. my lord, i gotchu.

POLONIUS. godspeed, fam—peace out.

REYNALDO. aight, my lord.

POLONIUS. peep his vibe through your own lens.

REYNALDO. i’ll do that, my lord.

POLONIUS. and let him jam on his own tunes.

REYNALDO. cool, my lord.

POLONIUS. peace.

[EXIT REYNALDO.]

ENTER OPHELIA.

POLONIUS. how now, ophelia, what’s up—why you lookin’ so shook?

OPHELIA. alas, my lord, i was hella shook.

POLONIUS. so, like, what hit you, in god’s name?

OPHELIA. my lord, i was chillin’ sewing in my room when lord hamlet rolled up all disheveled—his jacket totally off, no hat on, his socks a hot mess, unkempt and draped down to his ankles, his shirt ghostly pale, his knees clashing like they’re in a remix, and his face straight-up pitiful—as if he just escaped hell to drop some nightmare tea—and then he showed up outta nowhere.

POLONIUS. he buggin’ out for your love?

OPHELIA. my lord, i dunno, but tbh, i'm lowkey scared it’s true.

POLONIUS. what did he even say?

OPHELIA. he grabbed my wrist tight, like no chill; then stretched his whole arm out, and with his other hand over his brow, he started analyzing my face like he was tryna screenshot it. he hung around for a minute—finally, he gave my wrist a little shake, and with three solid nods of his head up and down, he dropped a massive, heart-crushing sigh that looked like it could break his whole vibe and end him. then, he bounced—turning his head over his shoulder like he had no idea how to navigate without his glasses—and even as he headed out, his eyes stayed locked on me till the very end.

POLONIUS. aight, come roll with me; i’m off to peep the king. this is the ultimate love overload—its wild, self-sabotaging energy that sends folks on desperate, wild missions, just like any epic passion out there messing with our souls. damn—have you dished any savage clapbacks on him lately?

OPHELIA. no, my lord; but like you commanded, i ghosted all his texts and totally blocked his access.

POLONIUS. that’s what got him twisted, for real. i’m lowkey sorry i didn’t drop better insights on him earlier—i thought he was just playin’ around, tryna wreck you. but damn, my jealousy is wild! it’s so our era to flip our opinions up high, just like the young ones who are lowkey clueless. come on, let’s bounce to the king. this tea must spill—if we keep it all bottled up, it might just stack up more sorrow than the love we’re supposed to hail.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE II. A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN AND ATTENDANTS.

KING. yo, welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern. we’ve been lowkey missing you, and our urgent need to use y’all had us sending you on the double. have you peeped any buzz about hamlet’s transformation—i call it that—‘cause his outer vibe and inner self are totally not what they used to be. more than just his daddy’s dip, this change has left him so far from himself i can’t even imagine. i need you both—since you grew up with him and have been so close to his youthful energy—to chill here at our court for a bit, so your hangouts can draw him back to some good vibes and help us scoop out whatever hidden sorrow might be wrecking him, so we can fix it up if we can.

QUEEN. good gentlemen, he’s been talking mad about you—and honestly, i doubt there are two peeps on this earth he vibes with more. if y’all can flex some mad class and goodwill by hanging with us for a while, boosting our hopes and all that, your visit will be remembered with kingly gratitude.

ROSENCRANTZ. yo, your majesties, with the royal clout you hold over us, you can straight-up boss us around instead of just kindly askin'.

GUILDENSTERN. we’re all in—we drop ourselves at your feet for whatever orders you throw down.

KING. thanks, rosencrantz and noble guildenstern.

QUEEN. thanks, guildenstern and dear rosencrantz. and i beg you, right now, go see my seriously switched-up son. someone fetch these gentlemen to where hamlet’s posted.

GUILDENSTERN. may the vibes be ever in our favor, so our presence and actions are lit and hella helpful to him.

QUEEN. ay, amen.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN AND SOME ATTENDANTS.]

ENTER POLONIUS.

POLONIUS. yo, my dude—the ambassadors from norway are back and lookin’ hella joyful, my good lord.

KING. you always come through with the good news.

POLONIUS. me, my lord? no cap, my liege, i’m on point with my duty, as solid as my soul, both to god and to you, my gracious king. i reckon—unless my brain’s off-track in this wild game of state—that i’ve uncovered the main trigger behind hamlet’s cray vibes.

KING. spill that tea, i’m dying to hear it.

POLONIUS. first, let the ambassadors in; my news is the main course for this epic feast.

KING. go ahead and welcome them in.

[EXIT POLONIUS.]

polonius tells me, my sweet queen, that he’s found the root of our son’s wild malfunction.

QUEEN. i bet it’s nothing but the main tea—his daddy’s death and our mad rushed wedding, no cap.

KING. well, we’ll sift through him.

ENTER POLONIUS WITH VOLTMAND AND CORNELIUS.

POLONIUS. welcome, my good friends! yo, voltmand, what’s the word from our norway bro?

VOLTMAND. mad respect and greetings back atcha. originally, norway sent out to shut down his nephew’s troop moves—which they thought was a setup against the polack; but on deeper check, they peeped it was aimed at your highness, and that got them all salty—‘cause his age, weak health, and lack of juice were playing a fake card. so they ended up putting detains on fortinbras; in short, he obeyed, got roasted by norway, and finally swore to his uncle never to flex arms against your majesty again. then, a hyped-up norway handed him three thousand crowns a year, plus the plug to use that same squad he used before against the polack—with a little extra note here,

[GIVES A PAPER]

hoping you’ll hook him up with safe pass-through your lands for this gig, with all the safety and allowances laid out.

KING. that sounds dope; at a more chill time we’ll peep, answer, and vibe on this business. meantime, thanks for hustlin’ hard. go rest up—tonight, we’re feasting together. major welcome home.

[EXEUNT VOLTMAND AND CORNELIUS.]

POLONIUS. alright, this biz is wrapped. my liege and madam, if i went off on what majesty truly is, what duty means, why day is day and night is night, we’d just be wasting time—no cap. so, since brevity is the soul of wit and all that extra fluff is just extra, i’ll cut to the chase: your noble son is totally mad. i mean, mad as in straight-up cray; ‘cause if you try to define true madness, it’s nothing but pure madness. but let’s move on.

QUEEN. more deets, less extra fluff.

POLONIUS. madam, i swear i’m not tryna be artsy about it. he is mad, that’s real—pure, pathetic mad, and it’s a damn shame; but enough of fancy talk, let’s just call him mad. now, what’s left is to figure out what’s triggering this mess—or more like, the root cause of this defect, ‘cause this broken vibe comes from a reason. that’s the deal, and furthermore, i’ve got a daughter—while she’s still mine—who, in total obedience, hit me up with this note. now, listen up and deduce:

[READS]

to the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified ophelia—yeah, that phrase is sus, a straight-up lame line; “beautified” is trash—but you gotta hear it.

[READS]

these; in her excellent white bosom, these, etc.

QUEEN. so, did hamlet drop that on her?

POLONIUS. dear madam, chill a sec; i gotchu.

[READS]

doubt thou the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt i love.

oh dear ophelia, i’m struggling with these numbers—I ain’t got the art to count my groans. but know this, i love thee best, o most best; believe it. adieu. evermore thine, dearest lady, as long as this crazy machine runs for hamlet.

POLONIUS. in obedience, my daughter showed me this; and even more, hamlet’s own solicitings—collected over time, by mood and place—were all fed to my ears.

KING. but how did she take his love vibe?

POLONIUS. what you think about me?

KING. like, loyal and straight-up honorable.

POLONIUS. i wish i could prove it. but imagine, if i’d been spillin’ all the hot deets on his winged love—before my daughter clued me in—what would you, or our dear queen, have thought if i’d been all over my heart, or just chillin’ with a silent wink, or peeped that love with lazy eyes? nah, i got busy and told my young miss straight: “lord hamlet is a prince, but he’s outta your star—this vibe is a no-go.” then i laid down the rules: lock yourself out of his drop-ins, admit no messengers, collect no tokens. she took the bait of my advice, and he, repulsed—long story short—slid into sadness, then into fasting, then into hyper-vigilance, then into weakness, then into a lightness; and from that downfall, into the full-blown madness we now mourn.

KING. you think it’s like that?

QUEEN. it might be, for real.

POLONIUS. has there ever been a time where i was all, “it is so,” and then it flipped the other way? i gotta know.

KING. not that i recall.

POLONIUS. take this as gospel, if things are otherwise.

[POINTS TO HIS HEAD AND SHOULDER]

if the vibes steer me right, i’ll dig out the truth—even if it’s hidden deep in the center.

KING. how should we test that further?

POLONIUS. you know, sometimes he goes on these marathon walks—like four hours right here in the lobby.

QUEEN. for sure, he does that.

POLONIUS. then, i’ll let my daughter loose to vibe with him. you and i, we’ll hide behind a curtain and scope the meet-up. if he ain’t vibing with her—and isn’t falling off his rocker over it—don’t count me in for state biz; i’ll just stick to the farm and the carts.

KING. bet, we’ll give it a shot.

ENTER HAMLET, READING.

QUEEN. yo, check it—the poor dude’s over here reading all gloomy.

POLONIUS. bounce, i beg y’all, get outta here; i’m about to scoop him up. oh, let me be.

[EXEUNT KING, QUEEN AND ATTENDANTS.]

how’s my good lord hamlet?

HAMLET. aight, god-a-mercy.

POLONIUS. yo, you know me, my lord?

HAMLET. i’m straight fine. yo, you’re a fishmonger.

POLONIUS. nah, my lord, not me.

HAMLET. then i wish you were as honest as you claim to be.

POLONIUS. honest, my lord?

HAMLET. ay, sir—being honest nowadays is like finding one true gem among ten thousand posers.

POLONIUS. that's mad real, my lord.

HAMLET. ‘cause if the sun can spawn maggots on a dead dog—like, it’s the ultimate kiss for dead meat—tell me, do you even have a daughter?

POLONIUS. i do, my lord.

HAMLET. then don’t let her catch rays. conception’s a blessin’, but not in the way your daughter might conceive, my dude—watch it.

POLONIUS. what you tryna say by that?

[ASIDE] still on my daughter, smh—dude didn’t even know me at first; he straight-up called me a fishmonger. he’s totally lost, far past the point of no return. and honestly, back in my day, i went through some hardcore love drama—pretty much like this. i’ll chat with him again.—what are you readin’, my lord?

HAMLET. words, words, words.

POLONIUS. what’s the tea, my lord?

HAMLET. between who?

POLONIUS. i mean, the stuff you’re readin’, my lord.

HAMLET. it’s all straight-up slander, sir. this sassy scribble says old dudes have grey beards, wrinkles for days, eyes oozin’ thick amber and plum-tree goop, and they’re void of wit with super weak hams. i lowkey believe it hard, but i reckon it ain’t honest to jot it down like that. you, sir, should be as old as me—if you could even trundle backwards like a crab.

POLONIUS.

[ASIDE] even though this is cray, there’s some method in his madness.—will you dip out of this airy vibe, my lord?

HAMLET. into my grave?

POLONIUS. indeed, that’s totally off the air.

[ASIDE] damn, his comebacks are so loaded sometimes! a burst of wild happiness that only madness can drop—something reason and sanity could never serve up. i’ll dip and cook up a sneaky meet-up between him and my daughter. my honorable lord, i’ll take my leave now.

HAMLET. you can’t, sir—you can’t snatch anything from me i’d part with more willingly, except my life, except my life, except my life.

POLONIUS. peace out, my lord.

HAMLET. these tedious old fools.

ENTER ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

POLONIUS. go look for lord hamlet—there he is.

ROSENCRANTZ.

[TO POLONIUS] god save ya, sir.

[EXIT POLONIUS.]

GUILDENSTERN. my honored lord!

ROSENCRANTZ. my most dear lord!

HAMLET. yo, my excellent besties! how u doin’, guildenstern? oh, rosencrantz—good dudes, how y’all feelin’?

ROSENCRANTZ. like, we’re just chillin’—indifferent kiddos of this crazy earth.

GUILDENSTERN. we’re good ‘cause we ain’t over-happy; on fortune’s hat, we ain’t even the top button.

HAMLET. nor even the soles of her kicks?

ROSENCRANTZ. nah, my lord.

HAMLET. so you’re hangin’ around her waist, or deep in her favours?

GUILDENSTERN. for real—we’re basically in her intimate circle.

HAMLET. in the secret parts of fortune? oh, most true; she’s a total troll. so, what’s the tea?

ROSENCRANTZ. nothing, my lord, except that the world seems to be gettin’ hella real.

HAMLET. then doomsday’s nearly here. but your news ain’t it. let me get specific—what hits have you, my good friends, taken from fortune that she tossed you into this prison?

GUILDENSTERN. prison, my lord?

HAMLET. denmark’s a prison, no cap.

ROSENCRANTZ. then the whole world’s one big cell.

HAMLET. a pretty dope one—with loads of confining cells, wards, and dungeons, and denmark’s one of the worst.

ROSENCRANTZ. we don’t really vibe with that, my lord.

HAMLET. well then, it’s not a prison to you, ‘cause nothing’s good or bad except what you make of it. to me, it’s a straight-up prison.

ROSENCRANTZ. so your ambition is what traps you—it’s too cramped for your mind.

HAMLET. o god, i could be chillin’ in a nutshell and still call myself king of infinite space—if it weren’t for these whack nightmares.

GUILDENSTERN. truly, dreams are basically ambition; the very vibe of ambition is just the shadow of a dream.

HAMLET. a dream is just a shadow, yo.

ROSENCRANTZ. for real, i see ambition as so light and breezy that it’s like a shadow’s shadow.

HAMLET. then our beggars are merely bodies, and our kings and epic heroes are just beggars’ shadows. shall we hit up the court? ‘cause, by my faith, i just can’t reason right now.

ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN. we got you, my lord.

HAMLET. nah, that’s not it. i ain’t bundling you with my other peeps; to be straight up honest, i’m drowning in attendants. but, as my true homie, what brings you to elsinore?

ROSENCRANTZ. we came to chill with you, my lord—nothing else.

HAMLET. even though i’m a total beggar and poor in gratitude, i still thank you. but real talk, my thanks are like a cherished halfpenny. weren’t you sent for? or did you just roll in on your own vibe? come on, be straight with me—speak up.

GUILDENSTERN. what should we even say, my lord?

HAMLET. anything, as long as you get to the point. you were summoned, and i can peep a bit of a confession in your eyes—despite all that modesty. i know the good king and queen sent for you.

ROSENCRANTZ. for what though, my lord?

HAMLET. so you can school me. but listen up—by the bond of our squad, our shared youth, and our forever epic love, and honestly, no one could charge you with greater truth than i do—be straight with me: were you summoned or not?

ROSENCRANTZ.

[TO GUILDENSTERN] what you say?

HAMLET.

[ASIDE] damn, i’ve got my eye on you. if you even care, don’t hold back.

GUILDENSTERN. my lord, we were indeed sent for.

HAMLET. i’ll tell you why, so my anticipation stops you from spilling the beans to the king and queen and keep your lips sealed. lately, i—i dunno why—lost all my vibe, skipped all my usual routines; and honestly, it weighs so heavy on my spirit that this once dope earth feels like a barren rock; this epic sky, this majestic roof lit up with golden fire—it just seems to me like a gross, pestilent mash-up of toxic vapors. what a piece of work is man—so noble in his reason, infinite in his skills, in form and hustle; in action he’s like an angel, in perception like a god—the beauty of the world, the ultimate model of animals. and yet, to me, what is man but pure dust? man delights me not; no, and woman either—even though your smiles might say otherwise.

ROSENCRANTZ. my lord, i never even thought about it that way.

HAMLET. then why’d you laugh when i said, “man delights me not”?

ROSENCRANTZ. to think, my lord, if you're not vibin' with humans, then these players are gonna get your full lenten hype. we scooped 'em up on the way, and they're cruisin' in to serve you.

HAMLET. yo, whoever's flexin' as king gets mad props – my whole vibe is tribute, no cap; the daredevil knight is gonna whip out his foil and target like a total boss; the lovey-dovey won't be droppin' sad sighs for free; the funny dude will wrap up his act in chill mode; and the lady’s gonna spill her tea fully, or the blank verse will straight-up pause. which players we talkin' about?

ROSENCRANTZ. nah, it's the same old squad you used to stan – the city's own drama crew.

HAMLET. so, what's the tea on their hustle? they used to be lit on both rep and coin, like double flex all around.

ROSENCRANTZ. i reckon their vibe got shook by some new trend, fr.

HAMLET. so, are they still gettin' mad love like when i was posted in the city? are they still viral, or what?

ROSENCRANTZ. nah, fam, they ain't it anymore.

HAMLET. yo, why's that? did they just catch some rust vibes?

ROSENCRANTZ. nah, their grind is still on fleek; but check it – there's a whole squad of mini influencers, little eyases, yellin' up a storm at every turn and gettin' savage applause. they're the new trend, totally trippin' up the common stages – so much so that even peeps rockin' fancy rapiers are lowkey scared of these goose-quill antics and barely show up.

HAMLET. what, they're actually kids? who’s runnin' this show? how are they gettin' rolled out? will they stick to quality only as long as they can spit a sick verse? and then later, if they turn into straight-up normie players – which is probs what'll go down if their clout ain't next level – are they gonna clap back at their own scribblers for makin' 'em sound off about their own drop?

ROSENCRANTZ. fr, there's mad drama on both sides; and the whole nation ain't even hatin' on throwin' shade at 'em. there was a minute when no one dropped coin on debates unless the poet and the player were ready to throw down in the discussion.

HAMLET. for real? like, is that even a thing?

GUILDENSTERN. omg, there’s been a wild tossin’ around of brains, no cap.

HAMLET. do the homies totally snatch it away, tho?

ROSENCRANTZ. facts, they do, my lord. even hercules and his whole crew got in on that vibe.

HAMLET. that’s not even cray; my uncle’s the king of denmark, and back when my old man was around, folks dissin’ him would drop twenty, forty, fifty, even a hundred ducats just for his mini cameo. damn, there's some extra cosmic tea in this, if philosophy can even spill it.

[FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS WITHIN.]

GUILDENSTERN. yo, the players just landed.

HAMLET. gentlemen, welcome to elsinore. come on, drop those hands. the full welcome drip is all about that fashion and ceremony. lemme suit up in this gear so my shoutout to the players doesn't end up lookin' like low-key entertainment compared to yours. welcome, squad. but heads up – my uncle-father and aunt-mother are totally bamboozled.

GUILDENSTERN. in what, my dear lord?

HAMLET. i'm only cray on the north-north-west vibe. when the wind flips south, i can tell a hawk from a handsaw, no cap.

[ENTER POLONIUS.]

POLONIUS. blessings on you, gentlemen.

HAMLET. hark, guildenstern, and you too – every ear's tuned in. peep that giant baby over there; he's still rockin' his swaddling wraps, fr.

ROSENCRANTZ. lit fact – he’s already made a second drop on them; like, they say an old dude is twice a kid.

HAMLET. i can totally predict he’s here to spill tea on the players. mark it – you’re right, sir, 'cause this went down on a monday morning, for real.

POLONIUS. my lord, i got some fresh tea for you.

HAMLET. my lord, i got tea too. when roscius was straight killin’ it as an actor in rome—

POLONIUS. the actors have rolled in here, my lord.

HAMLET. buzz, buzz.

POLONIUS. on my honor, no cap.

HAMLET. then each actor crashed in on his own, like totally on his ass—

POLONIUS. the absolute goats of acting, whether it's tragedy, comedy, history, a rustic pastoral vibe, a mix of pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, or even that wild tragical-comical-historical-pastoral mashup, scene-individable or poem-unlimited. seneca can never be too heavy, and plautus never too light, all in the name of the word and that sweet liberty. these are the only dudes.

HAMLET. oh jephthah, judge of israel, you had mad clout, fr.

POLONIUS. what kinda stash did he have, my lord?

HAMLET. like, one fire daughter, and that was it – and he was hella into her.

[aside.] still on my daughter.

HAMLET. ain't i on point, like, old jephthah style?

POLONIUS. if you wanna call me jephthah, my lord, i got a daughter i’m mad into.

HAMLET. nah, that don’t even compute.

POLONIUS. so, what's the drop then, my lord?

HAMLET. like, basically by the odds, god knows, and then, ya know, it just happened – like it was meant to be. the first row of that pious jam will drop more tea. peep where my cut comes in.

[ENTER FOUR OR FIVE PLAYERS.]

yo, masters, welcome to the squad – welcome, all of you. i'm stoked to see y'all in the flesh. welcome, good friends. oh, my old friend, your face is all remixed since i last peeped you. did you roll through to vibe with me in denmark? what’s up, my young lady and queen! by god, your ladyship is way closer to heaven now than the last time – like, you leveled up a whole chopine in altitude. pray to the gods that your voice, which is like a piece of rare, uncurrent gold, ain't cracked up in the ring. masters, y'all are mad welcome. we're gonna hit this joint like elite french falconers, swooping on any shiny drip we spot. we need a straight-up speech on deck. come on, drop a taste of that quality – give us some passionate fire.

FIRST PLAYER. which speech, my lord?

HAMLET. i remember you droppin' a speech once, but it never even got on stage – or if it did, it was a one-time vibe, 'cause the play, i recall, didn't please the masses at all; it was like gourmet caviar for a select few. but fr, i got that speech in my ear, along with others who totally raved, calling it an epic play – seamlessly chopped into scenes with a mix of modesty and cunning. i recall someone sayin' there weren't any extra salad bits in the lines to spice things up, nor any filler that screamed affectation – it was just an honest method, as wholesome as sweet and way fresher than fine. one speech i lowkey adored was aeneas' tale to dido, especially when he went off about priam's brutal slaughter. if that's still fresh in your brain, start at this line, let me see, let me see: the rugged pyrrhus, like th' hyrcanian beast,— oh, wait, scratch that – it kicks off with pyrrhus: the rugged pyrrhus, whose dark, sable arms, as black as his vibe, made the night look lit when he was chillin' in that ominous ride, now has his whole face lookin' mad dread and black, smeared with grim heraldry. from head to toe, he's all in total red, freakishly stained with the blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons – baked and slathered with the scorched, parched streets that throw a tyrannical and cursed glow on their vile murders. roasted in wrath and fire, and mega-sized with clots of gore, with eyes like burning carbuncles, the hellish pyrrhus now hunts old grandsire priam. so, keep it rollin', yo.

POLONIUS. for real, my lord, that was straight fire – mad well-spoken with dope accent and discretion.

FIRST PLAYER. anon, he finds him – strikin' too short at the greeks. his vintage sword, all rebellious to his arm, just drops where it falls, totally defiant of command. mismatched, pyrrhus drives priam in a rage, swingin' wide; but with the swoosh of his deadly sword, the unnerve-struck priam falls. then clueless iilium, almost feelin' the blow, with a blazing crown, stoops down, and with a savage crash snatches pyrrhus' ear. like, his sword, which was droppin' on priam's milky dome, even looked like it stuck in mid-air. so, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus just stood there, chillin' like a neutral, doin' nada. but, like, as we usually peep when a storm hits – silence in the heavens, the rack holds, bold winds get ghosted, and the orb below is as hush as death – then suddenly, a dreadful thunder smashes the scene; after pyrrhus' brief pause, vengeance lights him up, and never did the cyclops' hammers fall on mars's eternal armor with any less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword now droppin' on priam. out, out, you fickle, trampled fortune! all you gods, in one epic squad, snatch away her power; break all the spokes and bits off her wheel, and bowl that round nave straight down the heavenly hill, all the way to the fiends.

POLONIUS. bruh, that's a whole movie.

HAMLET. bet, it's gonna get trimmed at the barber’s, along with your beard. please, keep droppin' the tea. he's either down for a jig or spinnin' some bawdry tale, or maybe he's napping – so, spill on; head over to hecuba.

FIRST PLAYER. but yo, who, oh who, peeped the mobled queen,—

HAMLET. "the mobled queen"?

POLONIUS. vibes, that's fire! "mobled queen" is lit.

FIRST PLAYER. she’d be runnin’ barefoot up and down, threatenin' the flames with serious bisson rheum – like, a hard clout on that dome where the diadem used to chill, and for a robe, coverin' her skinny, over-the-top loins with a blanket snatched in pure panic—anyone who peeped that, with venom on their tongue, would’ve called out treason on fortune's state. but if even the gods had seen her back then, when she watched pyrrhus clown around by mincing her hubby's limbs with his sword, her instant burst of chaos—unless even mortals stayed stonecold—would’ve straight-up steamed heaven’s fiery eyes and lit up the gods with wild passion.

POLONIUS. yo, check him – still no color change and his eyes are teary. please, that's enough.

HAMLET. aight, it's cool. i'll have you spit the rest of that soon. good my lord, will you make sure the players get mad props? listen, let 'em get proper use, 'cause they're the quick highlights and ticking recaps of our time. after you're gone, it's way better to have a trash epitaph than live with their wack reviews.

POLONIUS. my lord, i'll put 'em to work just as they deserve.

HAMLET. god’s bodikin, man, that's way better. treat every dude based on his own drip, and who escapes the heat? use 'em by your own honor and dignity. the less they earn, the more your generosity shines. bring 'em in.

POLONIUS. come on, sirs.

HAMLET. follow that dude, friends. we got a play droppin' tomorrow.

[EXEUNT POLONIUS WITH ALL THE PLAYERS BUT THE FIRST.]

dost thou hear me, old friend? can you vibe out the murder of gonzago?

FIRST PLAYER. ay, my lord.

HAMLET. we'll drop it tomorrow night. you could, if needed, study a fire speech of like a dozen or sixteen lines, which i’d jot down and slot in, right?

FIRST PLAYER. ay, my lord.

HAMLET. bet. follow that vibe, and yo, don't roast him.

[EXIT FIRST PLAYER.]

[TO ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN] my good friends, i'm bouncin' 'til night – y'all are always welcome in elsinore.

ROSENCRANTZ. good, my lord.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

HAMLET. ay, so, god be with you. now i'm solo. oh, what a rogue and peasant slave i am! can you believe that this player here, in just a wild fiction, in a dream of raw passion, managed to flex his soul so hard to his own vibe that his whole face drained out – tears spilling, look all distracted, voice all broken, and his entire act completely matchin' his inner hype? and all for nada! for hecuba? what’s hecuba to him, or him to hecuba, that he'd be cryin' like that? what would he do if he had the same mad motive and cue for passion i got? he'd flood the stage with tears and blast the crowd’s ears with brutal speech; drive the guilty into madness and shock the free; confuse the clueless and straight-up amaze every eye and ear. yet here i am, a basic, muddy hustler, spittin' like john-a-dreams without any cause, and i got nothin' to show for it. no, not for a king whose own turf and dearest life suffered a cursed defeat. am i a coward? who calls me villain, smacks my dome? snatches my beard and blows it right in my face? tweaks my nose, gives me a lie deep in my throat all the way to my lungs? who does that to me? ha! damn, i should probably clap back – it can only mean i got pigeon liver, and lack that savage bile to turn oppression bitter, else i would've fed all the local kite gangs with this slave's scraps. bloody, bawdy villain! remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, heartless villain! oh vengeance, what an ass i am! it's wild that i, the son of a dearly murdered father, pushed to avenge by both heaven and hell, gotta, like a hooker, unload my heart in words and start cursing like a total scrub, a bottom feeder! fie on it! foh! come on, brain, get with it! i've heard that guilty peeps sittin' through a play can get so deep in the feels from the scene's savage vibe that they end up confessing all their shady deeds. 'cause murder, though silent, speaks through the most miraculous organ. imma have these players drop a scene like the murder of my father right in front of my uncle. i'll watch his every look; i'll test him to the quick. if he even flinches, i know my next move. the spirit i saw might be the devil, and the devil’s got the power to flex as somethin' hella pleasing, and maybe from my own weak, depressed vibe – since that devil juice is strong on peeps like me – he's usin' me to get me cursed. i'll dig up even more solid ground than this. the play’s the move by which i'll snatch the king's conscience.

[EXIT]
