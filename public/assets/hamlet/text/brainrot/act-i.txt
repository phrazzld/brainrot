ACT I

SCENE I. ELSINORE. A PLATFORM BEFORE THE CASTLE.

[ENTER FRANCISCO AND BARNARDO, TWO SENTINELS.]

BARNARDO. yo, who’s there?

FRANCISCO. nah, fam—answer up. stand tall and show your vibe.

BARNARDO. long live the king, no cap!

FRANCISCO. barnardo, right?

BARNARDO. yeah, it's me.

FRANCISCO. you timed your drop like a total boss.

BARNARDO. it’s 12, my dude—hit the sack, francisco.

FRANCISCO. thanks for the rescue, bro. it's mad cold out here and i’m feeling hella low.

BARNARDO. did you peep a chill vibe on guard?

FRANCISCO. not even a mouse was vibin’, straight up.

BARNARDO. aight, peace out. if you bump into horatio and marcellus—my watch crew—tell 'em to slide over fast.

[ENTER HORATIO AND MARCELLUS.]

FRANCISCO. yo, i think i hear some peeps. hold up—who’s rollin’ up?

HORATIO. we’re just the homies holding it down on this turf.

MARCELLUS. and the die-hard squad of the dane.

FRANCISCO. peace, fam.

MARCELLUS. aight, farewell, real one—who tagged in for your shift?

FRANCISCO. barnardo’s got my back. good night, yo.

[EXIT.]

MARCELLUS. yo, barnardo!

BARNARDO. say, is horatio in the house?

HORATIO. i’m here, reppin’ that same vibe.

BARNARDO. welcome, horatio. what's good, marcellus?

MARCELLUS. yo, did that spooky vibe show up again tonight?

BARNARDO. nah, i saw nada, zero.

MARCELLUS. horatio’s like, “it's just our overactive imaginations,” not tryna believe in that creepy drip even though we peeped it twice. so i begged him to roll with us tonight—so if the ghost reboots itself, he can confirm it and spill the tea.

HORATIO. yo, chill—it ain’t coming back, trust.

BARNARDO. sit down for a sec, and let us blast your ears with the deets of what we peeped these last two nights, even if you're all clapped out.

HORATIO. aight, let's park and hear barnardo break it down.

BARNARDO. last night, that same star way out west from the pole was flexin’ its route to light up that stretch of sky where it’s lit right now—marcellus and i, with the bell droppin’ one—

MARCELLUS. yo, hold up, cut it out—peep it comin’ back!

[ENTER GHOST.]

BARNARDO. it’s rollin’ in the same drip, lookin’ just like our ex-king.

MARCELLUS. yo, horatio, you brainiac—drop some words to it.

BARNARDO. ain’t it giving off king vibes? peep that, horatio.

HORATIO. for real, fam—it’s mad on point. got me shakin’ with fear and wonder.

BARNARDO. it seriously needs to drop some lines.

MARCELLUS. grill it, horatio—ask it straight up.

HORATIO. yo, who even are you, crashin’ our midnight vibe with that fly and fierce look that used to scream the majesty of dead denmark? swear on the heavens, spit some truth.

MARCELLUS. it's kinda triggered, no lie.

BARNARDO. check it—it's slowly ghostin’ outta here.

HORATIO. yo, wait up! TALK, TALK! i’m orderin’ you to speak!

[EXIT GHOST.]

MARCELLUS. it's gone, and ain't droppin’ a word.

BARNARDO. how now, horatio! you’re shakin’ and lookin’ all pale—this ain’t just wild imaginin’, right? what’s your take, bro?

HORATIO. swear on my god—I wouldn’t believe this without a legit flex from my own eyes.

MARCELLUS. it’s totally king vibes, no cap?

HORATIO. like you vibe with yourself—that was exactly the drip of his armor when he battled ambitious norway; he even pulled an epic frown when he clapped those sleddin’ fools on the ice. straight up bizarre.

MARCELLUS. so, twice now, at this dead-ass hour, he strutted past our watch in full martial mode.

HORATIO. i dunno what his exact vibe is, but overall, this signals some wild eruption about to hit our state.

MARCELLUS. aight, park your butt and break it down for me—why is our super strict night watch grindin’ so hard every night over our crib, and why are we droppin’ brass cannons and exotic war gear daily; why are we even hustlin’ legit shipbuilders who don’t even chill on sundays? what’s the tea that this mad rush is turnin’ night into a tag-team with day? someone please spill the deets.

HORATIO. i got the tea: word on the street is our last king—who just showed up as that ghostly drip—was challenged by fortinbras of norway, all hyped on pride and ready to duke it out; our valiant hamlet (the real mvp in our world) clapped that fortinbras. by a sealed deal, law and heraldry on fleek, fortinbras lost all his lands to our conqueror; our king even put up half the loot as a bet—which would’ve gone back to fortinbras if he’d won—but by that same pact, it fell to hamlet. now, young fortinbras—a hot-headed, no-nonsense dude—has been rounding up a crew of lawless misfits in norway, schemin’ to snatch back his dad’s lost lands. and this, i take it, is the main drive behind our current hustle, the reason we’re posted up on watch and rushin’ around the land.

BARNARDO. i bet that’s it, no cap—this ominous vibe showin’ up armed during our watch totally mirrors that old king, who’s both the legend and the bomb question behind all these wars.

HORATIO. honestly, it’s a tiny glitch for the mind’s eye. back in rome—just before julius got wrecked—the graves were ghostin’ with no tenants and dead dudes in sheets were squawkin’ all over the roman streets; stars were like insta-stories with fiery trails and blood dews, disasters under the sun; even that damp star, which neptune uses for his empire, was almost eclipsed to doomsday mode. all those spooky pre-shows of epic events—like the ultimate setup for fate—have been laid out by heaven and earth for our peeps.

[RE-ENTER GHOST.]

but, yo, peep this! look—it’s rollin’ back up! i’ll cross paths with it even if it yeets me. hold up, illusion! if you got any sound or mad voice power, spill that tea. if there’s any good fix to ease your ghostly vibe and bless me, then speak up. if you’re in on your homeland’s fate and can ghost-hack it to dodge doom, then drop some deets! or if you’ve stashed treasure deep in the earth—and they say spirits walk in death for that loot—then spill it. hold up, and speak!

[THE COCK CROWS.]

stop it, marcellus!

MARCELLUS. should i yeet it with my partisan?

HORATIO. do it if it don’t stand its ground.

BARNARDO. it's here, yo!

HORATIO. it's here, no cap!

[EXIT GHOST.]

MARCELLUS. it's dipped, fam! we went too extra, all majestic and overblown, tryin’ to serve violent theatrics—like it's untouchable air—while our lame hits just served as a savage roast.

BARNARDO. it was about to drop the tea when the cock clucked.

HORATIO. then it peeped, like a guilty beast when called out by fear. i heard that cock—the morning trumpet—with its high-key, shrill vibes wake up the day god; and at its shout, whether over sea, fire, earth, or air, that wild spirit bounced back to its crib. for real, our ghost flexed its truth.

MARCELLUS. it straight-up faded when the cock started crowin’. word is that every time our savior’s b-day season pops off, the dawn bird sings all night long; and then, no spirit dares crash the scene—the nights are pure, no planetary chaos, no fairy magic, nor any witch got the power to charm; that time is hella blessed.

HORATIO. i've heard that drill, and kinda buy into it. but check it—the morn, draped in a russet mantle, is strollin’ over the dew on that high east hill. let’s break our watch, and i say we drop what we peeped tonight to young hamlet; on my life, this ghost—though mute to us—will eventually spill the tea to him. y’all down to loop him in? it's our duty.

MARCELLUS. bet, let's do it. i’m tryna know where we can find him easy this morning.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE II. ELSINORE. A ROOM OF STATE IN THE CASTLE.

[ENTER CLAUDIUS, KING OF DENMARK, GERTRUDE, THE QUEEN, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTEMAND, CORNELIUS, LORDS, AND ATTENDANTS.]

KING. even though our dear hamlet’s late pop is still fresh in our minds—drowning our hearts in grief and wrapping the whole kingdom in one massive mood of sorrow—we’ve managed to balance that raw pain with some wise self-checks, remembering ourselves too.

KING. so, our once-sis, now our queen—our imperial partner in this war-torn state—we went ahead and married her with a mix of bittersweet joy and salt, rockin’ one lit eye and one droppin’ eye, blending funeral vibes with wedding dirges, balancing delight and dole on the same scale. and yo, we didn’t block your top-tier ideas on this deal. massive thanks to all.

KING. next, peep young fortinbras. this dude either thinks we’re weak or believes that with our dear brother’s death our state is gonna fall apart—planning to flex his own gains. he’s been blowin’ up our line demanding the surrender of those lands his dad lost, all legit under the law, to our valiant bro. that’s his hustle. now, on to us and today’s sit-down: we’ve penned a letter to norway—fortinbras’s uncle—who’s so weak and bedridden he barely catches wind of his nephew’s plan to shut his moves down here; since all our troops, drafts, and full forces come from his peeps, we’re dispatchin’ you, good cornelius, and you, voltemand, as our messengers to old norway. we’re givin’ you no extra clout beyond what this mega memo allows. farewell—let your hustle speak to your duty.

CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND. bet, in all that, we’ll flex our duty.

KING. no doubt, fam—heartily, farewell.

[EXEUNT VOLTEMAND AND CORNELIUS.]

KING. and now, laertes, what’s the 411 with you? you mentioned some sitch—spill it, laertes. you can’t just clown around with the dane and lose your drip. what are you cravin’ that i haven’t already offered? your head is as tied to your heart as denmark’s throne was to your father’s; what do you want, laertes?

LAERTES. yo, my lord, i need your go-ahead to dip back to france—i rolled in here willingly for your coronation vibes; but now that my duty’s done, my heart’s beggin’ to bounce back to france—so grant me your chill consent and pardon, please.

KING. did you get your old man’s blessing? what’s polonius say?

POLONIUS. my lord, he wrung my slow-ass permission with a ton of petitions; and in the end, i hammered in my consent. i beg you, let him bounce.

KING. take your sweet time, laertes—the clock’s yours, so flex your best vibes however you want! but now, my cuz hamlet, and my son—

HAMLET. [aside] more than fam, less than friendly, smh.

KING. why you still rockin’ those gloomy clouds, bro?

HAMLET. nah, my lord, i’m just too extra in the sunlight.

QUEEN. dear hamlet, ditch that dark drip and let your eyes vibe friendly on denmark. don’t keep searchin’ for your noble dad in the dirt forever—everyone who lives gotta dip eventually, passin’ from nature into eternity.

HAMLET. yeah, madam, it’s basic.

QUEEN. if it’s basic, why you actin’ so extra about it, boo?

HAMLET. extra? nah, it straight up is; i ain’t talkin’ 'bout a performed vibe. it’s not just my inky cloak, good mom, or the standard all-black drip, or even my over-the-top sighs, nor the river of tears or that dejected mug i sport—those are just the props and acts a man can play. i got deep feels inside that go way beyond the show—the real stuff behind these trimmings of woe.

KING. it’s sweet and respect-worthy that you honor your pop with this deep mourning; but peep it—your father lost his own dad, and that lost dude lost his, so the survivor had a basic duty to mourn for a bit. yet to stick in nonstop, stubborn grief is just extra and unmanly—it shows a heart not tough enough, a mind too impatient, and a lack of proper schooling in feelz. since the death of fathers is the most common tea anyone gets, why take it so personal? honestly, it’s a diss to heaven, to the dead, to nature, and to plain ol’ reason—from the first corpse till now, everyone’s been like “this gotta be it.” we pray you drop this unyielding woe and think of us as your dad; know that you’re next in line to our throne, and we love you with all the royal feels a dear father can pass on. and about you headin’ back to school in wittenberg—that’s totally not what we want. we beg you to stay here in the warmth and comfort of our gaze, our top courtier, cousin, and son.

QUEEN. don’t let your mom lose her prayers, hamlet. i’m beggin’ you—stay with us; don’t jet off to wittenberg.

HAMLET. i swear, i’ll do my best to obey you, madam.

KING. yo, that’s a loving and dope reply. be yourself here in denmark. madam, come on in; this chill, unforced vibe from hamlet is straight smilin’ on my heart—so much so that every bit of denmark’s cheer today is like a mega cannon blast in the clouds and the king’s call will have the heavens buzzin’ with epic earthly thunder. let’s bounce.

[EXEUNT ALL BUT HAMLET.]

HAMLET. o, that this too too solid flesh would just melt away—thaw and become dew! or that the everlasting hadn’t set up his canon against self-slaughter. o god! o god! why does every single use of this world seem so weary, stale, flat, and totally unprofitable? fie on it! oh fie! it’s like a neglected garden overrun with weeds—just letting all the gross, rank junk take over. i can’t believe it’s come to this! only two months dead—no, even less than two: such an excellent king; that’s like comparing hyperion to a satyr; so mad loving to my mother that he wouldn’t let the winds of heaven rough her up. heaven and earth—must i really remember? she clung to him like her hunger grew by what she fed on; yet within a month—let me not even dwell on it—frailty, thy name is woman! barely a month passed, and before those shoes even got old, as she trailed my poor father’s body like niobe—just drowning in tears—she married. o, this wicked speed, rushin’ straight into those incestuous vibes! it can’t be good. but break, my heart; i gotta keep my trap shut.

[ENTER HORATIO, MARCELLUS, AND BARNARDO.]

HORATIO. big ups to your lordship!

HAMLET. i’m stoked to see y’all doin’ good—horatio, or i might forget my own vibe.

HORATIO. same here, my lord—your forever broke servant, for real.

HAMLET. yo, my good friend, i’ll swap that title with you. so, what brings you from wittenberg, horatio?—and marcellus?

MARCELLUS. my good lord, straight up.

HAMLET. i’m mad glad to see you. good even, sir—but seriously, what’s the word from wittenberg?

HORATIO. just vibin’ as a truant, my lord.

HAMLET. i ain’t gonna let your haters talk you into it, nor use my ears to make you doubt your own rep. i know you’re no truant. so what’s your hustle in elsinore? we’ll school you on the deep sauce before you bounce.

HORATIO. my lord, i came to peep your dad’s funeral.

HAMLET. please don’t roast me, fellow student—I reckon it was to scope out my mom’s wedding.

HORATIO. for sure, my lord—it followed right on.

HAMLET. chill, chill, horatio! those funeral snacks ended up chillin’ at the wedding spread. i wish i’d met my dearest foe in heaven—or even seen that day, horatio. my father—i swear, i think i see my dad.

HORATIO. where, my lord?

HAMLET. in my mind’s eye, horatio.

HORATIO. i peeped him once; he was a solid king, no cap.

HAMLET. he was the real deal—and honestly, i ain’t ever gonna vibe with another like him.

HORATIO. my lord, i kinda saw him last night.

HAMLET. saw? which one?

HORATIO. my lord, your dad—the king.

HAMLET. the king, my father!

HORATIO. hold up your admiration for a bit and tune in, 'til i drop this marvel on you with these gentlemen as witnesses.

HAMLET. for god’s love, spill it.

HORATIO. so, for two nights straight, these dudes—marcellus and barnardo—on guard in the dead, empty middle of night, ran into this figure lookin’ just like your dad, fully kitted out head-to-toe, strollin’ by all solemn and stately; he passed right in front of their freaked-out eyes three times, stayin’ just within his staff’s reach, while they were shook stiff—almost jelly from fear—unable to drop a word. they dished all this in deep secrecy, and i kept watch with them on that third night when the ghost showed up word-for-word, proving it real. i knew your dad; these hands aren’t more alike than that.

HAMLET. but where did this go down?

MARCELLUS. my lord, on the platform where we keep watch.

HAMLET. didn’t you try to drop a line to it?

HORATIO. my lord, i did; but it gave nothin’—although, i swear, it once lifted its head like it wanted to chat. but then the morning cock busted out loud, and it yeeted away in a mad hurry, totally vanished.

HAMLET. that’s mad strange.

HORATIO. for real, my honored lord—it’s true; and we figured it was our duty to loop you in on this.

HAMLET. indeed, indeed, guys—but this is hella unsettling. are y’all holding the watch tonight?

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. we got you, my lord.

HAMLET. you all armed up, yeah?

BOTH. armed, my lord—head to toe, no doubt.

HAMLET. so y’all didn’t catch a proper look at its face?

HORATIO. oh yes, my lord—it had its face all amped up.

HAMLET. like, did it even serve a frowny vibe?

HORATIO. its look was way more sorrow than anger, my dude.

HAMLET. so, was it ghostly pale or straight-up red?

HORATIO. nah, like, super pale.

HAMLET. and did it lock its eyes on you?

HORATIO. non-stop, like it was on a mission.

HAMLET. i wish i had been there, no cap.

HORATIO. trust, it would’ve blown your mind.

HAMLET. for real, for real—did it stick around long?

HORATIO. if you cruised at a chill pace, you might clock a hundred steps while it was there.

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. longer, longer!

HORATIO. not when i peeped it, no cap.

HAMLET. his beard was lookin’ mad grizzled, right?

HORATIO. yo, it was exactly like i’ve seen it before – all dark and silvered to perfection.

HAMLET. imma keep an eye out tonight; maybe it’ll roll up again.

HORATIO. bet, for real – it will, no doubt.

HAMLET. if it dares to flex as my noble pops, imma come at it with words even if hell itself be like, “hold up, zip it.” i’m tryna ask y’all, if you’ve been keepin’ this ghost tea on the DL so far, do me a solid and keep it on the down low; and whatever extra wild vibes drop tonight, lock ‘em in your mind but keep your lips sealed. i gotchu for real. so peace out. meet me on the platform between 11 and 12, imma slide through.

ALL. our duty to your honour, no cap.

HAMLET. your love’s as real as mine, peace out.

[EXEUNT HORATIO, MARCELLUS AND BARNARDO.]

my dad’s ghost is out here clappin’ in full armor! things ain’t vibin’ right; i smell some major sus moves. wish the night had already dropped! till then, chill, my soul – these shady moves are gonna pop off even if the whole earth tries to ghost ‘em from everyone’s eyes.

[EXIT.]

SCENE III. A ROOM IN POLONIUS’S HOUSE.

enter laertes and ophelia.

LAERTES. my essentials are all booked up, so imma bounce. and sis, when the winds are boosting and your ride’s got your back, don’t snooze on me – hit me up, aight?

OPHELIA. you doubt that, fam?

LAERTES. as for hamlet, his love vibes are basically just a fad – like a trendy toy in his blood. think of it as a fresh violet in nature’s prime – poppin’ for a hot sec, sweet but not built to last; just a minute’s worth of hype, nothing extra.

OPHELIA. literally nothing more?

LAERTES. exactly – so don’t overthink it. remember, nature’s glow-up isn’t only about flexing muscles; as your body temple levels up, the mind and soul get their upgrade too. maybe he’s into you right now, and nothing’s dirtin’ his vibe; but watch out – when he levels up, his free will ain’t all his own ‘cause he’s locked into his royal lease. he can’t just carve his own path like us normies since his choices affect the whole state. so if he drops an “i love you,” your smarts should only believe it if his moves back it up – basically, it’s as legit as denmark’s main vibe. then, peep the burn on your rep if you let every one of his tunes slide or open up your heart to his unchecked flexes. ophelia, fr fr, be woke and keep your feels on a safe mode – don’t get caught up in that dangerous desire.

OPHELIA. imma lock in these epic life hacks inside my heart. but yo, big bro, don’t be one of those basic, clueless pastors who preach the steep, thorny route to greatness while they themselves are out here trippin’ on the primrose path like total wildcards.

LAERTES. yo, don’t trip – i’ve been hanging too long anyway. oh snap, my dad’s in the building.

[ENTER POLONIUS.]

POLONIUS. a double blessing is, like, double grace; the universe is flexin’ with a bonus leave.

POLONIUS. yo laertes, step on board – no wonder you’re draggin’. the wind’s boostin’ your sail and you’re holdin’ up. take my blessing, bro.

[LAYING HIS HAND ON LAERTES’S HEAD.]

POLONIUS. peep these life hacks in your mental playlist: keep your thoughts on lockdown and don’t let ‘em spill out unfiltered. be cool with your crew but don’t go basic; lock in the real ones tight like your fav crypto, and don’t waste your palm energy on every new wannabe. steer clear of petty beef – but if you get caught up, make sure your opponents know you’re not to be messed with. lend your ear to everyone but save your voice for the ones who matter; take in the feedback but keep your own opinions clapped on mute. flex on your drip if your wallet allows, but keep it classy – rich vibes, not extra clownery, ‘cause your fit speaks more than words, and the elite in france run that game. and yo, don’t borrow or lend – loans can wreck friendships and mess up your money game. above all, stay true to yourself; ‘cause if you’re not 100 with you, you’ll come off fake to everyone else. peace out – my blessing is locked into you.

LAERTES. i’m out, my lord, with mad respect.

POLONIUS. time’s callin’, so bounce – your crew’s got you.

LAERTES. peace out, ophelia – remember every word i dropped.

OPHELIA. got it, locked up in my mental vault – and you’re holdin’ the key too.

LAERTES. later.

[EXIT.]

POLONIUS. so, ophelia, what tea did he spill to you?

OPHELIA. um, basically, some vibes about lord hamlet.

POLONIUS. yo, after thinking on it, word’s been that lord hamlet’s been lowkey spending one-on-one time with you; and you, girl, have been dishin’ it out all generous-like. if that’s true – and imma be real cautious here – i gotta say, you’re not reading your own signals like a true daughter should, or up to your rep’s standards. so, spill it: what’s really goin’ down between you two? be straight with me.

OPHELIA. my lord, he’s been droppin’ mad affection offers on me lately.

POLONIUS. affection? puh-lease! you sound like a rookie girl, unfiltered in a risky sitch. are you really buyin’ his sweet offers, as you call ‘em?

OPHELIA. i honestly don’t know what to think, my lord.

POLONIUS. imma school you – think of yourself as a baby, ‘cause you’re takin’ these offers like they’re the real deal, but they ain’t sterling. love yourself harder; or, to put it plainly, you’ll end up lookin’ like a fool.

OPHELIA. my lord, he’s been hitting me up with love in a pretty legit way.

POLONIUS. yeah, you might call it that – but come on now.

OPHELIA. and he’s been backing his words with practically all the sacred promises, my lord.

POLONIUS. yeah, they're just bait set-ups to catch clueless chicks. i know when the blood’s lit, the soul goes off droppin’ vows like it’s on sale – these flames give off more flash than heat and fizzle out quick. from now on, be less available with your glow; level up your standards higher than just replying to every DM. for lord hamlet, trust his youth – he’s got a wider roam than what you deserve. bottom line, ophelia, don’t swallow his sweet-talk vows – they’re just shady brokers hustlin’ unholy deals, spittin’ sanctimonious lines to scam you. i’m tellin’ you plain: from now on, don’t waste even a sec chattin’ with lord hamlet. got it? now bounce, i charge you.

OPHELIA. imma obey, my lord.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE IV. THE PLATFORM.

[ENTER HAMLET, HORATIO AND MARCELLUS.]

HAMLET. yo, this air’s straight-up savage – colder than an ex’s heart, no cap.

HORATIO. legit, it’s that nippy, hype air vibe.

HAMLET. what’s the clock sayin’ now?

HORATIO. low-key, it’s before twelve.

MARCELLUS. nah, fam, it’s already hit twelve.

HORATIO. for real? i didn’t even catch that. so it’s droppin’ into that spooky hour when ghosts normally roll, huh?

[A FLORISH OF TRUMPETS, AND ORDNANCE SHOT OFF WITHIN.]

what’s this even mean, my lord?

HAMLET. so, the king’s up tonight, throwin’ down his rager – keepin’ the wassail lit and his swagger on full reel; as he chugs his rhenish, the kettle drum and trumpets are blastin’ the hype of his pledge.

HORATIO. is that the usual flex?

HAMLET. yup, for real; and honestly, even though i’m born and bred local, this rager tradition is more notorious for gettin’ us clapped than for real honor. this heavy party from east to west gets us labeled as total drunks – our rep gets trashed by other nations; they call us clumsy and our slang weak, and it even robs us of the real juice of our achievements. so many dudes, ‘cause of some minor glitch they can’t control since they’re born that way, end up gettin’ roasted by one tiny fault that corrupts their whole vibe.

HORATIO. yo, my lord, it’s comin’!

[ENTER GHOST.]

HAMLET. angels and chill vibes, protect us! whether you’re a healthy spirit or a cursed goblin, bring your heavenly airs or infernal blasts – no matter if you’re here with wicked vibes or chill intentions, you’re lookin’ hella sus, so imma speak to you. i’ll call you hamlet, king, father, royal dane – answer me, don’t leave me in the dark; spill why your canonized bones, all wrapped in death swag, busted outta your tomb; why that sepulchre where we saw you posted in eternal rest just popped open its heavy marble jaws to yeet you out again! what’s it mean that you, dead dude, all suited up in full armor, are cruisin’ under the moon, makin’ the night look ugly and sendin’ our brains into total overload? spill – what’s the move? what should we do?

[GHOST BECKONS HAMLET.]

HORATIO. it’s like, signalfyin’ you should bounce with it – like it’s droppin’ exclusive tea just for you.

MARCELLUS. peep how politely it’s tryna lead you out to a remote zone; but no cap, don’t follow that vibe.

HORATIO. nah, for real.

HAMLET. if it won’t spit any words, then imma just roll after it.

HORATIO. please, my lord, don’t go with it.

HAMLET. why be scared? i ain’t riskin’ my life for a cheap bet; and my immortal soul? it ain’t got the power to harsh my vibe. it’s tryna send me off all friendly-like – so imma follow.

HORATIO. but what if it lures you to the deep end or up to some mega scary cliff, then morphs into a nightmare that robs you of your chill and sends you spiraling into madness? think about it – that spot is a total hype trap for desperate vibes, gettin’ wild ideas from the abyss.

HAMLET. it’s still flashin’ at me – so imma keep trailing it. come on, i’m on board.

MARCELLUS. my lord, you defo shouldn’t bounce with it.

HAMLET. hold up, ease off your hands.

HORATIO. for real, you’re not headin’ out with it.

HAMLET. yo, my fate’s screamin’ at me – makin’ every little vein in my body tough like a nemean lion’s nerve.

[GHOST BECKONS.]

still, i’m bein’ summoned. unhand me, bros!

[BREAKING FREE FROM THEM.]

by the gods, imma yeet anyone who holds me back. i’m like, “bounce, now come on – imma follow you.”

[EXEUNT GHOST AND HAMLET.]

HORATIO. he’s goin’ full-on desperate with that wild imagination.

MARCELLUS. let’s bounce after him; it ain’t cool to let him dip like that.

HORATIO. go on then – what’s the endgame here?

MARCELLUS. yo, something’s seriously rotten in denmark.

HORATIO. may heaven sort it out.

MARCELLUS. nah, for real, let’s follow him.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE V. A MORE REMOTE PART OF THE CASTLE.

[ENTER GHOST AND HAMLET.]

HAMLET. where you takin’ me, ghost? spill the deets – i’m not movin’ further without an RSVP.

GHOST. listen up, fam.

HAMLET. i gotchu.

GHOST. my time’s almost up – soon, imma dip into some sulfurous, hellish flames and hand over my vibe.

HAMLET. oh man, poor ghost!

GHOST. don’t hit me with the pity – lend me your ears ‘cause i’m ‘bout to drop some heavy tea.

HAMLET. spill it, i’m all ears.

GHOST. once you hear this, you’re gonna be all about revenge.

HAMLET. say what?

GHOST. i am your pops’ spirit, doomed to wander these nights and stuck dakin’ in fire by day until all my toxic past gets burned off. but i’m not allowed to drop the secrets of my afterlife cell – i could spin a tale so savage that one word would freeze your blood, make your eyes pop like stars bouncin’ off their orbits, and have every hair on your head stand up like quills on a stressed-out porcupine.

but this eternal tea ain’t for mortal ears – so listen up, listen up, listen up! if you ever loved your dear old dad—

HAMLET. oh god!

GHOST. get revenge for his gross, un-natural murder.

HAMLET. murder!

GHOST. murder on a next-level foul scale – twisted, strange, and totally un-natural.

HAMLET. hurry up and spill it, so i can get my revenge on warp speed – like meditation-fast or love-thought quick.

GHOST. i see you’re on point; you'd be even dumber than a fat weed chillin’ on lethe wharf if you didn’t catch this. so listen up, hamlet: word is, while i was chillin’ in my orchard during my usual afternoon zen, your uncle jacked my prime time with some cursed hebenon juice from a vial, pourin’ that nasty, leperous distillate straight into my ears. its effect was so toxic that it dissed human blood, rushin’ through every channel like quicksilver, then curdlin’ it like milk getting soured by extra heavy cream droppings. that’s exactly how it hit me; and then, an instant gross blob spread all over me like a lazar mold with vile crust – i was felled, sleepin’, by my brother’s hit: life, crown, and queen all yeeted in one go – cut off in the prime of my sinful bloom, abandoned, disappointed, and unburied; no proper reckoning, just my faults stamped all over my head. oh, it’s hella horrific! if you got any decency, don’t let it slide – don’t turn denmark’s royal bed into a crib for extra luxury and cursed incest. and no matter how you roll next, keep your mind clean and don’t let your soul scheme against your mom; leave her to heaven and to the thorns in her heart that’re there to sting her. peace out ASAP – the glow-worm’s flashing that dawn’s near and its weak fire is already fadin’. adieu, adieu, adieu. remember me.

[EXIT.]

HAMLET. oh all you hosts of heaven and earth – what’s next? should i even link up with hell? oh, fie! hold up, my heart; and you, my sinews, don’t age on me – keep me standin’ strong. remember you? yeah, you poor ghost, as long as memory’s still kickin’ in this scatterbrained globe. remember you? imma wipe away all those trivial old-school vibes, every tired quote and clapped-out cliché that youth once copied – only your commandment’s gonna live deep in my brain, pure and unmixed. by the gods, o, that most toxic woman! o villain, villain, smilin’ cursed villain! my notes prove it – someone can smile and still be a villain! and i’m dead sure that’s how it goes in denmark.

[WRITING.]

so, uncle, there you are. now, listen to my word – it’s “adieu, adieu, remember me.” i swear on it.

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. [WITHIN.] my lord, my lord.

MARCELLUS. [WITHIN.] lord hamlet.

HORATIO. [WITHIN.] may heaven have his back.

HAMLET. so be it!

MARCELLUS. [WITHIN.] yo, ho, ho, my lord!

HAMLET. heyo, ho, ho, boy! come on, bird, come.

[ENTER HORATIO AND MARCELLUS.]

MARCELLUS. how’s it goin’, noble lord?

HORATIO. what’s the deets, my lord?

HAMLET. oh, that’s lit!

HORATIO. chill out, my lord – spill the tea.

HAMLET. nah, you’re gonna let it out.

HORATIO. not me, my lord, swear on it.

MARCELLUS. me neither, my lord.

HAMLET. so, what d’ya think, my dudes? but you’ll keep it on the down low, right?

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. ay, by heaven, my lord.

HAMLET. there’s never a villain in all denmark who isn’t just a straight-up arrant knave.

HORATIO. we don’t need a ghost from the grave to drop that truth, my lord.

HAMLET. right on; so, without further drama, i say we shake hands and bounce: you do your thing, ‘cause everyone’s got their own hustle, and me, i’m headin’ off to pray.

HORATIO. these words are just wild and whirlin’, my lord.

HAMLET. sorry if my words got you heated, but i’m speakin’ from the heart – for real.

HORATIO. no offense taken, my lord.

HAMLET. yeah, by saint patrick, there is some serious tea, horatio – a whole lot of offense. listen up: this vision is legit – an honest ghost, lemme tell you. since you’re all over this and hyped to know what’s up between us, my dear friends – scholars and soldiers alike – i got just one request.

HORATIO. what’s that, my lord? we’re down.

HAMLET. swear you’ll never drop a word about what you saw tonight.

HORATIO and MARCELLUS. my lord, we won’t.

HAMLET. nah, swear it.

HORATIO. in faith, my lord, not i.

MARCELLUS. nor i, my lord, for real.

HAMLET. i swear on my sword.

MARCELLUS. we already swore, my lord.

HAMLET. indeed, on my sword, indeed.

GHOST. [CRIES UNDER THE STAGE.] swear.

HAMLET. ha, ha, boy – you say that? you there, truepenny? come on, you – listen to this dude in the cellar. agree to the oath, bro.

HORATIO. propose the oath, my lord.

HAMLET. swear you’ll never spill what you saw tonight – swear on my sword.

GHOST. [beneath] swear.

HAMLET. hic et ubique? then we’re changin’ the game. come here, gentlemen, and put your hands back on my sword. swear again that you’ll never spill this tea, swear on my sword.

GHOST. [beneath] swear.

HAMLET. well said, old mole! you hustle on this earth so fast – a legit pioneer! now bounce out, good friends.

HORATIO. oh my days, this is insanely weird.

HAMLET. so, as a stranger, welcome the extra vibes. there’s more going down in heaven and earth, horatio, than all the wild theories in your feed. but yo, listen up: no matter how extra i get in the future – even if i decide to act all antic and wild – when you see me, don’t be all extra with those arm hugs or head shakes, or droppin’ half-baked phrases like “well, we know” or “we could if we want” – don’t signal that you know my secrets. so, for real, swear to keep it on the DL. may grace and mercy be with you – swear.

GHOST. [beneath] swear.

HAMLET. rest, rest, troubled spirit. so, my peeps, with all my love i hand myself over to you; and even though i’m just a poor dude, my love and friendship – god willing – won’t be lacking. let’s roll out together, and keep those fingers zipped, i pray. time’s completely off, yo. o cursed fate that i was born to fix all this mess. nah, come on, let’s bounce together.

[EXEUNT.]
