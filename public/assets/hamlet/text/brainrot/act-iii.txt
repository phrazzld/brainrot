ACT III

SCENE I. A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

[ENTER KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

KING. and can y'all, by any random twist of fate, get him to spill why he's rockin' this chaotic vibe, turnin' all his chill days into a storm of crazy, dangerous lunacy?

ROSENCRANTZ. he straight-up admits he’s feelin' hella distracted, but when it comes to the cause, he ain't spillin' a thing.

GUILDENSTERN. and we can't even get him to open up; he's keepin' it on some sly mad vibe when we try to grill him about his real feels.

QUEEN. did he vibe with y'all nicely?

ROSENCRANTZ. he acted all like a proper gent, for sure.

GUILDENSTERN. but he was lowkey forcein' that vibe, you know?

ROSENCRANTZ. he was stingy with questions, but when we asked, he was super loose in his replies.

QUEEN. did you try gettin' him on any side hustle or pastime?

ROSENCRANTZ. madam, it so happened that some players we bumped into on the way—we told him about 'em, and he lit up hearin' that. they're around the court, and i think they've already lined up a play for him tonight.

POLONIUS. that's on point; and he even begged me to holla at your majesties to peep the whole matter.

KING. with all my heart; it really makes me happy to hear him so hyped. good gentlemen, push him further and drive his vibe toward these delights.

ROSENCRANTZ. we got you, my lord.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

KING. sweet gertrude, bounce with us too, 'cause we just summoned hamlet here on the low—so he might, like, accidentally confront ophelia. her father and i, legit keepin' watch like secret spies, will ghost our way so that, unseen, we can judge his encounter straight up and figure out from his vibes whether his suffering is all about madd love or not.

QUEEN. i shall obey you. and ophelia, my dear, i hope your fine looks are the spark behind hamlet's wild energy; i trust your virtues will bring him back to his usual legendary self, for both your honors.

OPHELIA. madam, i hope so too.

[EXIT QUEEN.]

POLONIUS. ophelia, slide over here.—if you please, we're gonna hang out.—[to ophelia.] check out this book so that your vibe might pop even in your loneliness.—we often get called out for this; it's proven that with all that devoted face and pious act, we even sugarcoat the devil himself.

KING. [ASIDE.] damn, it's too real! how hard that speech slaps my conscience! a harlot's cheek, all decked out in fancy plaster art, ain't uglier to the thing that supports it than my shady deed is to my super polished words. oh, heavy burden!

POLONIUS. yo, i hear him comin'. let's dip, my lord.

[EXEUNT KING AND POLONIUS.]

[ENTER HAMLET.]

HAMLET. to be, or not to be, that’s the ultimate question: is it more savage in the mind to take the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to step up and throw down against a sea of troubles and, by clappin' back, end 'em? to die—to sleep, no cap; and in that sleep, we end the heartache and a thousand natural shocks that our flesh inherits. it's the ultimate finish everyone wishes for. to die, to sleep. to sleep, maybe dream—yo, that's the rub, 'cause in that death-sleep what dreams might drop, when we finally ghost this mortal coil, forces us to pause. that's the real respect that turns a long life into non-stop calamity. who would wanna bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor’s BS, the proud man’s savage burns, the agony of rejected love, the law's lag, the insolence of office, and the spurns that the unworthy heave on the patient, when he himself could just end it all with a bare bodkin? who would bear these extra weights, grunting and sweatin' through a worn-out life, except for the dread of something after death—the undiscovered country from which no traveler returns—that baffles the will and makes us choose to suffer what we’ve got rather than fly to unknown ills? thus, our conscience turns us all into softies, and the pure vibe of resolution gets washed out by overthinking, so that even our boldest moves lose their real action. yo, hold up – the fair ophelia! nymph, in your prayers, remember all my sins, aight?

OPHELIA. good my lord, how's your vibe holdin' up these days?

HAMLET. i humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA. my lord, i got some of your remembrances that i've been dying to hand back to you. please, take 'em now.

HAMLET. nah, not me. i never gave you anything.

OPHELIA. my honored lord, you know damn well you did, and with those sweet-ass words that made everything pop – even if their vibe faded, take these back; 'cause to a noble mind, rich gifts lose their shine when the givers are cold. here, my lord.

HAMLET. ha, ha! you for real?

OPHELIA. my lord?

HAMLET. you lookin' legit?

OPHELIA. what exactly are you sayin', my lord?

HAMLET. that if you're honest and fine, then your honesty shouldn't even let your beauty spill any extra tea.

OPHELIA. could beauty, my lord, ever strike a better deal than with straight-up honesty?

HAMLET. ay, no cap; 'cause beauty's power will flip honesty into a bawd way faster than honesty can convert beauty into a copy of itself. that used to be a paradox, but now the time proves it. i did love you once.

OPHELIA. indeed, my lord, you totally had me believe that.

HAMLET. you shouldn't have bought it; 'cause virtue can't boost our ancient stock enough for us to truly relish it. i did not love you.

OPHELIA. i was even more bamboozled.

HAMLET. bounce to a nunnery. why would you be cranking out sinners? i'm kinda honest myself; but i could totally roast me for so many shady things that it's better my mother had never birthed me. i’m hella proud, revenge-hungry, and ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to even shape 'em or time to act 'em out. what should a loser like me do, crawlin' between earth and heaven? we're all total knaves, straight up – trust none of us. go your way to a nunnery. where’s your father?

OPHELIA. at home, my lord.

HAMLET. lock his doors up so he only acts a fool in his own crib. farewell.

OPHELIA. oh help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET. if you get hitched, i'm gonna slap this plague as part of your dowry. be as ice-chaste, as pure as fresh snow – you won't dodge the shade, no cap. get to a nunnery, go: farewell. or if you must marry, then marry a fool; 'cause wise peeps know exactly what monsters you turn 'em into. to a nunnery, go; and fast, too. farewell.

OPHELIA. oh heavenly powers, bring him back, for real!

HAMLET. i've peeped your makeup and self-crafted face too, and god gave you one face while y'all flip it to another. you jig, you wander, you lisp, and even nickname god’s creatures, turning your wild side into pure cluelessness. yo, i'm done with that – it's drivin' me mad. i say, no more marriages. those already hitched – all but one – shall live; the rest, keep 'em as they are. to a nunnery, go.

[EXIT]

OPHELIA. oh dang, what a dope mind got totally yeeted, no cap! the whole vibe of the courtier, soldier, scholar—his eye, his tongue, his sword, the hype and rose of our lit state, the flex of fashion and blueprint of drip, the one every watcher was lowkey stalking—is straight up crashed, completely down! and me, one of the most dejected, heartbroken queens who was forever slurping the honey of his sonic promises, now peep that majestic, sovereign brainpower, like sweet bells jangled outta tune and harsh af, that one-of-a-kind glow of wild youth totally trashed by overclout ecstasy. oof, i’m salty as heck—i saw what i saw, and i still see it.

ENTER KING AND POLONIUS.

KING. love? nah, his feels aren’t vibing that way, and even though his speech was a bit off-form, it wasn’t full-on cray. there’s some deep shade brewing in his soul—his gloomy mood got him all broody—so i’m suspecting that when he finally drops the truth, it’s gonna be hella dangerous. to preempt that mess, i’m like, bet, and i’m shipping him straight to england ASAP for that overdue tribute. maybe the wild seas and flip-flopping lands, with their remix vibes, will yeet that lodged drama outta his heart and reset his whole vibe. what y’all think on that?

POLONIUS. it’s all good, my lord. but i still lowkey believe his sad tea started from some neglected love. hey, ophelia, you don’t gotta spill all the deets about lord hamlet’s drip—we caught the tea already. my dude, do as you please, but if it’s on point, after the play, let his queen mum slide an invite to him for a one-on-one heart-to-heart; and i’ll be peeping in on their conversation, if you’re down. if she ain’t picking up his vibe, then yeet him to england; or lock him down wherever your mad smarts say, aight?

KING. bet, it’s a go. we can’t let our top-tier homies go off grid and mad off.

EXEUNT.

SCENE II. A HALL IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER HAMLET AND CERTAIN PLAYERS.

HAMLET. yo, speak the speech exactly like i dropped it for you—smooth on the tongue. but if u just mumble it like half your crew does, i’d rather have a town-crier spit my lines. and please, don’t go flailing your arms like you’re at a rave—keep it chill; cuz in that savage storm, that whirlwind of passion, you gotta vibe with measured finesse to give it that smooth drip. it straight up offends my soul when some extra, periwig-rockin’ dude shreds a passion into tatters—turning epic feels into total rag status—and splits the ears of all those clueless groundlings who can only manage goofy silent shows and noise. i’d totally have that dude whipped for overdoing it—no cap, he out-cranks even herod. so, please, keep it 100.

FIRST PLAYER. i got you, my lord.

HAMLET. yo, don’t be too tame either; let your own instinct be your guide. match your moves to your words and your words to the action—with the special rule that u don’t go overboard and break nature’s chill. ‘cause anything extra is totally off from the true art of playin’, whose goal—then and now—was and is to hold a mirror up to nature; to show virtue its true drip, roast its own image, and let the vibes of the age press on every form. now, if you overdo it or show up late, even if it makes the clumsy squad snicker, it’ll leave the real ones feeling low—whose harsh judgments outweigh a whole theater of extras. oh man, i’ve seen players drop wild performances—and heard mad praise for them—that, not to drop too much shade, but without the proper accent or walk, they strutted and yelled so hard i thought nature’s own crew hacked humanity and, like, totally fumbled the assignment by imitating it so abysmally.

FIRST PLAYER. i hope we’ve fixed that vibe, my lord.

HAMLET. oh, just scrap the whole rework. and let the clowns stick exactly to their script—don’t go off freestyling, even if some of them crack up and get a bunch of bored peeps laughing, while missing the deep deets of the play. that’s straight-up villainous, showing mad pathetic ambition in the fool who does it. now, squad, go get ready.

EXEUNT PLAYERS.

ENTER POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

how now, my lord? will the king peep this masterpiece?

POLONIUS. and the queen too, and like, right now.

HAMLET. tell the players to hustle up.

[EXIT POLONIUS.]

HAMLET. yo, can you two speed up their flow?

ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN. we will, my lord.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

HAMLET. what ho, horatio!

ENTER HORATIO.

HORATIO. here, my dude, at your service.

HAMLET. horatio, you’re seriously the chillest homie—just like every real one i’ve ever kicked it with.

HORATIO. oh my dear lord.

HAMLET. nah, don’t get it twisted—i’m not just buttering you up; what level-up can i expect from you if you ain’t makin’ bank, just vibin’ on your good spirit to keep you iced? why should the broke get extra sweet words? nah, let that sugar-coated tongue hype absurd flex, and bend those knee joints where being smart follows clout chasing. you feel me? since my soul was the boss of her own playlist and could spot real ones, it locked you in for itself. cuz you’ve been that one—holding it down even in the drama, a dude who takes life’s savage hits with equal thanks. blessed be those who mix that raw blood and brainpower, so they aren’t just a puppet for fortune’s random hits. give me a man who ain’t a slave to his feels, and i’ll stash him in the core of my heart, legit, just like i feel you. damn, that’s extra.

HAMLET. btw, there’s a play tonight in front of the king. one scene is mad similar to the tea i spilled about my dad’s dip. i’m tellin’ you: when you see that scene go live, with every fiber of your soul, keep your eyes peeled on my uncle. if his hidden guilt doesn’t drop in one savage speech, then it’s a damn ghost we saw—and my mind’s as fouled up as vulcan’s workshop. peep him hard; my eyes are locked on his face—and then we’ll squad up to roast his act, no cap.

HORATIO. aight, my lord. if he tries to snatch any deets during the play and bails without anyone clockin’ it, i got you—i’ll catch that baller move.

HAMLET. yo, they’re rolling up to the show. i gotta chill now. squad, snag a spot.

danish march. a whole flair.

ENTER KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN AND THE REST.

KING. what’s good with our cuz hamlet?

HAMLET. straight fire, for real; like the ultimate chameleon snack—I munch on air, packed with promises: you know, you can’t serve capons like that.

KING. i’m not vibing with that answer, hamlet; those words? not my jam.

HAMLET. nah, neither are mine now. (to polonius) yo, my dude, you acted back in uni, right?

POLONIUS. yeah, my lord, i did that—apparently, i crushed it.

HAMLET. so, what play did you drop?

POLONIUS. i did julius caesar. got snuffed at the capitol—brutus totally offed me.

HAMLET. that was a savage move, straight-up brutal, offing such a prime young dude. squad, are the players locked and loaded?

ROSENCRANTZ. yup, my lord; they’re chillin’, just waiting on your vibe.

QUEEN. come over here, my dear hamlet, park yourself by me.

HAMLET. nah, good mother—check it, i got some metal that’s way more attractive.

POLONIUS. (to the king) yo, check that out!

HAMLET. lady, can i crash in your lap?

[LYING DOWN AT OPHELIA’S FEET.]

OPHELIA. nah, my lord.

HAMLET. i mean, can i rest my head on your lap?

OPHELIA. yeah, my lord.

HAMLET. you think i was droppin’ local, country vibes?

OPHELIA. i’m thinkin’ zilch, my lord.

HAMLET. that's a sick thought—like chillin’ right between the maids’ legs.

OPHELIA. what’s the tea, my lord?

HAMLET. nothing, nada.

OPHELIA. u’re way too jolly, my lord.

HAMLET. who, me?

OPHELIA. yeah, my lord.

HAMLET. oh god, you’re the only hype master around! what’s a man supposed to do but be merry? peep how cheerfully my mother’s vibin’, even though my dad dipped within two hours.

OPHELIA. nah, it’s more like twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET. so long? damn, then let the devil rock black, cuz i’m gonna rock a suit of sable. o heavens! if my pops dipped two months ago and we’re still stanning him, then there’s hope a legend’s memory can last at least half a year. but for real, by her ladyship, he’d need to start building churches; or else he’s doomed to forget himself, like that lame hobby-horse whose tombstone screams, “for, oh, for oh, the hobby-horse is forgot!”

TRUMPETS SOUND. THE DUMB SHOW ENTERS.

ENTER A KING AND A QUEEN, ALL LOVEY-DOVEY; THE QUEEN SNUGGLES HIM AND HE’S ALL ABOUT IT. SHE GETS ON HER KNEES AND GOES OFF PROFESSING HER FEELS. HE PICKS HER UP, LAYS HIS HEAD ON HER NECK, AND DROPS HER ON A BED OF FLOWERS. SEEING HIM ASLEEP, SHE BOUNCES. THEN, OUTTA NOWHERE, A FELLOW ROLLS IN, DOFFS HIS CROWN, PLANTS A KISS ON IT, DRIPS POISON INTO THE KING’S EARS, AND YEETS OUT. THE QUEEN ROLLS BACK, FINDS THE KING DEAD, AND GOES ALL PASSIONATE. THE POISONER RETURNS WITH A FEW MUTE HOMIES, LOOKIN’ SAD AND WRETCHED WITH HER. THE DEAD BODY IS SCOOPED UP. THE POISONER THEN TRIES TO WIN THE QUEEN’S HEART WITH SWAGGY GIFTS. SHE’S LOWKEY HESITANT AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY FINDS HIS VIBE.

EXEUNT.

OPHELIA. what’s the sitch here, my lord?

HAMLET. yo, this is straight-up miching mallecho—it means pure mischief.

OPHELIA. looks like this show’s droppin’ the tea on the play’s whole plot.

ENTER PROLOGUE.

HAMLET. we’re gonna peep it all through this dude: players can’t keep secrets—they spill every deet, no cap.

OPHELIA. will they drop the deets on what this show meant?

HAMLET. yeah, or any show you throw at him. don’t be shy—if you show it, he’ll def break it down for you.

OPHELIA. you’re so nothing, nothing at all—I’ll keep track of the play.

PROLOGUE. for us, and for our epic tragedy, we’re lowkey bowing to your clemency—please lend us your ears, patiently.

HAMLET. is this a prologue, or just a petty ring bling rhyme?

OPHELIA. it’s short and sweet, my lord.

HAMLET. just like a woman’s love.

ENTER A KING AND A QUEEN.

PLAYER KING. yo, count it: phoebus’ whip has rolled 30 full laps around neptune’s salty spa and tellus’ orb, and like 30 dozen borrowed moonbeams have crisscrossed the globe (12 times 30, no cap), ever since love locked our hearts and hymen linked our hands in the dopest, most sacred bonds.

PLAYER QUEEN. so many trips can the sun and moon clock for us before love runs out. but, oof, you’ve been mad off lately—so far from that cheery glow you used to rock—that i’m lowkey sus. yet even though i’m shook, i won’t harsh your vibe, my lord; for a woman’s fear and love roll in equal measure—whether extra or minimal. now, the proof of my love is clear, and as my love scales up, so does my doubt. where love is boss-level, even the tiniest doubt turns into fear; and where little fears get hyped, massive love erupts.

PLAYER KING. yo, i gotta bounce, love—my dope skills are about to kick in, and you’re gonna stay in this fly world, honored, adored, and maybe even the perfect canvas for a hubby—

PLAYER QUEEN. dang, screw the rest. that kinda love is straight-up betrayal in my heart. for a second hubby, i’m totally cursed—no one can even marry a second time unless they off the first, no cap.

HAMLET. [ASIDE] wormwood, wormwood.

PLAYER QUEEN. like, the reasons for a second marriage are all about saving coin, not about love. i’d even off my second hubby if he dares plant one on me in bed.

PLAYER KING. i feel you, but our plans? they’re often yeeted. purpose is just the sidekick to memory—born in wild drama but lacking real clout—like unripe fruit that hangs on the tree, only to drop when it finally ripens. we absolutely gotta forget our self-debts. the wild passions we hype up eventually fizzle out once the feels fade. both the savage hits of grief and joy end up self-destructing. where joy turns up, grief gets extra; grief gets cheers, joy gets bummed on the slimmest chance. this world ain’t forever, and it’s no shocker that our loves flip with our fortunes. that’s the mystery we still gotta solve: does love hustle fortune, or does fortune hustle love? watch how the upper crust gets all their fav flies, while the underdogs turn enemies into pseudo-bffs; and so far, love rides on fortune—‘cause if you’re never in need, you won’t miss a friend, and if you are, even a fake pal turns into an enemy. but to wrap up where i started, our vibes and destinies run so oppositely that our master plans keep gettin’ clapped. our thoughts are truly ours, but their outcomes? not so much. so, think it through—no second hubby vibes; just log off once your first lord is done.

PLAYER QUEEN. neither does the earth serve me grub, nor the sky drop light, and no chill or play breaks come my way day or night—turning my trust and hope into total desperation, like an anchor’s cheer locked in a cell. every vibe that dims joy just wrecks what i could’ve had—destroying it! here and beyond, may constant drama chase me, if ever i’m a widow and still stuck as a wife.

HAMLET. (to ophelia) if she drops it now…

PLAYER KING. it’s sworn deep, for real. sweet, leave me here a bit—i’m so over this dull day, i just wanna catch some z’s.

[SLEEPS.]

PLAYER QUEEN. sleep tight, rock your brain, and may no bad mojo come between us.

[EXIT.]

HAMLET. madam, how you feelin’ about this play?

QUEEN. the lady’s protesting way too much, i think.

HAMLET. oh, but she’s gonna stick to her word.

KING. have you peeped the plot? or is there zero offense in it?

HAMLET. nah, nah—they’re just clownin’ around, droppin’ poison as jokes; no real beef in this wild world.

KING. what do you call this show?

HAMLET. the mousetrap. marry, how? totally tropically. this play is like a mirror of a murder lowkey done in vienna—gonzago’s the duke’s tag, his wife baptista: u’ll catch on soon; it’s a shady piece of work, but so what? your majesty, and we free souls, ain’t even bothered. let the jaded haters cringe—our backs remain unstressed.

ENTER LUCIANUS.

this is lucianus, the king’s nephew.

OPHELIA. you’re a solid hype crew, my lord.

HAMLET. i could deep-dive between you and your boo, if i could peep your puppets dallying.

OPHELIA. you’re hella sharp, my lord.

HAMLET. it’d take a serious groan to shave off my edge.

OPHELIA. still, that’s both a win and a loss.

HAMLET. so you got your husbands all mixed up—now, begin, murderer. pox on it, scrub off your damnable mugs, and start. come on, the croakin’ raven is howlin’ for revenge.

LUCIANUS. dark thoughts, slick hands, meds on point, and time’s vibin’ with us—this is that confederate season, else no one’s even clockin’ it; you’re a rank mix of midnight weeds, cursed by hecate three times over, thrice infected—your natural magic and grim mojo are straight-up hijacking all the good vibes of life, effective immediately.

[POURS THE POISON INTO THE SLEEPER’S EARS.]

HAMLET. he drips poison in the garden for his stash. his name’s gonzago. the tea is out, penned in straight-up choice italian. u’ll peep soon how the killer lands gonzago’s wifey.

OPHELIA. the king’s on the rise.

HAMLET. what, shook by fake flames?

QUEEN. how’s my lord doin’?

POLONIUS. cut out the play already.

KING. gimme some light. scram.

ALL. lights, lights, lights.

[EXEUNT ALL BUT HAMLET AND HORATIO.]

HAMLET. damn, let the wounded deer weep and the bare-horned stag perform; ‘cause some gotta watch while others catch z’s—the world keeps on rollin’. wouldn’t that, sir, along with a whole forest of feathers—and if the rest of my luck flips turk on me, with two provincial roses on my busted kicks, score me a crew call-out in a cry of players, my guy?

HORATIO. half a share, my lord.

HAMLET. a whole one, i promise. cuz u know, oh dear damon, this kingdom was literally dismantled by jove himself, and now it’s ruled by a super extra—pajock.

HORATIO. u could’ve dropped a rhyme there.

HAMLET. oh good horatio, i’ll trust the ghost’s word like it’s worth a thousand pounds. peep that?

HORATIO. solid, my lord.

HAMLET. so, about that poison tea?

HORATIO. i definitely clocked him.

HAMLET. ah ha! yo, bring some tunes. come on, get the recorders. cuz if the king ain’t down with the comedy, then maybe he’s not feelin’ it at all—perdieu! come on, drop some music.

ENTER ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

GUILDENSTERN. good my lord, can i snag a word with you?

HAMLET. sir, it’s a whole saga.

GUILDENSTERN. the king, sir—

HAMLET. yeah, sir, what’s up with him?

GUILDENSTERN. he’s in major retreat mode, like totally off his rocker.

HAMLET. with booze, sir?

GUILDENSTERN. nah, my lord; it’s more like he’s catchin’ mad choler.

HAMLET. your brains should flex harder so the doctor gets the memo—if i try to purge him, it might just plunge him even deeper into choler central.

GUILDENSTERN. chill, my lord, wrap your words up and don’t go off on my saga too wild.

HAMLET. i’m chill, sir, as pronounced.

GUILDENSTERN. the queen—your mother, in a major mood swing—sent me over to you.

HAMLET. thanks, fam.

GUILDENSTERN. nah, my lord, this vibe ain’t on point. if u can drop a straight-up answer, i’ll follow your mother’s orders; if not, your pardon and my bounce will seal the deal.

HAMLET. sir, i can’t do that.

GUILDENSTERN. what, my lord?

HAMLET. give you a proper answer—my wit’s kinda busted. but, sir, whatever answer i whip up, you shall command; or as u say, my mother. so, cutting the fluff, my mother, u say—

ROSENCRANTZ. then she says: your moves have totally blown her mind and left her in amazement and mad admiration.

HAMLET. oh, sweet son, someone who can stun his own mom! but is there no follow-up to her mad stanning?

ROSENCRANTZ. she wants to chat with you in her private room before you crash.

HAMLET. we’ll roll with that—even if she’s ten times our mom. anything else for us?

ROSENCRANTZ. my lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET. and i still do—through these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANZT. good my lord, what’s rockin’ your mood? you’re basically locking yourself away if you don’t share your feels with your bro.

HAMLET. sir, i’m just not leveling up.

ROSENCRANZT. how’s that even possible when you got the king’s own vibe lined up for your takeover in denmark?

HAMLET. yeah, sir, but as long as the grass grows—the proverb’s kinda musty, i guess.

ENTER PLAYERS WITH RECORDERS.

HAMLET. oh, the recorders—lemme peep one. if y’all are out here tryin’ to snatch my vibe like you wanna force me into extra grind, why u doin’ that?

GUILDENSTERN. oh my lord, if my duty’s too bold, then my love is just too extra uncouth.

HAMLET. i don’t really get that. can u play this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN. my lord, i can’t do it.

HAMLET. i beg ya.

GUILDENSTERN. trust me, i just can’t.

HAMLET. i seriously ask ya.

GUILDENSTERN. i ain’t got that skill, my lord.

HAMLET. it’s as easy as spittin’ tea: use your finger and thumb to control these pipes, blow life into it with your mouth, and it’ll drop the most eloquent beats. peep these stops!

GUILDENSTERN. but i can’t make these stops drop any harmony—I’m just not skilled.

HAMLET. yo, check it out—u make me look hella basic! u wanna jam on me, claim you know my stops, yank out the core of my mystery, and vibe me from my lowest drop to my highest peak; and there’s mad beats, top-tier voice in this little organ, yet u just can’t make it sing. damn, u really think i’m easier to be played than a pipe? call me any instrument you want—but even if u break me, u still can’t play me.

ENTER POLONIUS.

god bless you, sir.

POLONIUS. my lord, the queen wants to speak with you, like, right now.

HAMLET. yo, you peep that cloud over there? it’s lowkey lookin’ like a camel.

POLONIUS. for real, it’s totally camel vibes.

HAMLET. nah, i feel like it’s more of a weasel, honestly.

POLONIUS. nah, it’s definitely weasel-backed.

HAMLET. or maybe a whale, bro.

POLONIUS. mad whale vibes, no cap.

HAMLET. then i’ll slide to my mother eventually—they got me messed up to the max—but i’ll come through, soon.

POLONIUS. i’ll be sayin’ so.

[EXIT.]

HAMLET. “by and by” is just talk, y’all—bounce, my friends.

[EXEUNT ALL BUT HAMLET.]

’tis now the very witching hour, when graveyards are lowkey yawning and even hell be blowing toxic vibes all over this world. i’d legit be down to guzzle some spicy hot blood rn and pull off some savage, bitter moves that’d leave the daylight shook. hold up though—gotta ease off on mom vibes. oh heart, don’t ditch your real self; no cap, don’t let that extra nero energy slide into my core. i wanna be cold and savage, but keep it 100 natural. imma spit straight-up verbal daggers at her, no actual blades, 'cause my tongue and soul are just frontin’. if she even dares to catch these savage bars, hell nah, my soul ain’t signing off on that drama.

[EXIT.]

SCENE III. A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER KING, ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

KING. i ain’t vibing with him, and it’s totally unsafe if we let his cray moves roam free. so squad up, 'cause i’m dispatching a commission ASAP, and he’s bouncing off to england with y’all. our kingdom can’t handle his hourly lunacy—it’s straight-up dangerous.

GUILDENSTERN. bet, we got this. it’s like a super sacred duty to keep all the peeps who live off your majesty safe, no cap.

ROSENCRANTZ. like, every one-of-a-kind life is locked in with mental armor to dodge petty annoyances, but even more, it’s that squad spirit holding up a ton of lives. when a king drops, it ain’t a solo vibe; it drags everything down like a massive wheel perched on the tippy top of the hype mountain, with like ten thousand tiny add-ons hanging on—and when that wheel crashes, every little extra gets hit with the downfall. the king’s demise ain’t just a lonely sigh; it’s a full squad groan, no cap.

KING. gear up, squad, for a quick mission; we’re about to cuff this cray vibe that’s out here running wild.

ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN. bet, we’ll hustle up.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

ENTER POLONIUS.

POLONIUS. my lord, dude’s sliding over to his mom’s personal closet. i’m ‘bout to sneak behind the arras to catch the tea. i’m betting she’ll roast him big time, and like you said, it’s smart to have more ears than just a mom’s ‘cause nature gives moms that extra vibe. peace out, my dude—i’ll hit you with the deets before you crash.

KING. thanks, my lord.

[EXIT POLONIUS.]

HAMLET. yo, my crime is hella rank and it reeks straight up to heaven—like it’s cursed from the start with that OG brother-murder vibe! damn, even if i wanna pray, my will’s slipping—my mega guilt totally cancels out my bold plans. i’m stuck, like when you try to double-task and end up frozen in between hustles, so i’m just chilling in limbo, neglecting both. what if this jinxed hand’s so saturated with my bro’s blood it’s basically a blood bank? ain’t there enough heavenly rain to scrub it back to fresh snow? what’s mercy even for if not to call out this shady vibe? and prayer? it’s like a two-for-one power move—either stopping you before you fall or giving you a pardon after you crash. so, i’ll just look up. my mess is done. but yo, what kind of prayer can fix my turn? forgive me for my dirty murder? nah, ’cause i’m still holding onto all the loot from that—my crown, my savage ambition, and, obvs, my queen. can you even get forgiven and still keep the drip? in this messed-up world, bad deeds sometimes flex their way out by buying off justice. but up above, no cap—there’s no switching lanes; the deed’s etched in your true self, and we’re forced to show our flaws for all to see. so what now? let’s see what repentance can do—what can’t it do? but then, what’s it even worth if you can’t vibe with repentance? oh, cursed state! oh heart, so dark like total death vibes! oh stuck soul, fighting to break free yet extra locked down! help, angels! get on it: bow down, stubborn knees, and let your heart, wired like steel, soften up like the chill muscles of a newborn. trust—everything will be lit.

[RETIRES AND KNEELS.]

ENTER HAMLET.

HAMLET. yo, now that he’s praying, i could totally take him out, like right this moment. if i do it now, he goes straight to heaven—and that’s my reveng’d move, but that’d be straight-up scammed: a villain offed my dad, and here i, his only son, end up sending that same villain to heaven. fr, that’d be like getting paid instead of getting even. he snatched my dad crudely, loaded with cash and all his crimes out in the open like a flush may—who even checks his audit except heaven? but in our own sagas, it’s too heavy on him. and if i off him once his soul’s all cleaned up, when he’s all set for his exit? nah, not happening. up, sword! hit him when he’s passed out, or totally wasted, or deep in that twisted bed passion—gaming, cursing, or doing any act with zero taste for salvation—then trip him so hard his kicks send his soul straight to hell, making it as damn dark and black as the underworld it’s headed to. mom still stays in play. this lame medicine only prolongs his sick days.

[EXIT.]

THE KING RISES AND ADVANCES.

KING. my words bounce up high, but my thoughts are chilling way down low. words without real feels never make it to heaven.

[EXIT.]

SCENE IV. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER QUEEN AND POLONIUS.

POLONIUS. he’ll roll in straight up. yo, set up a chill zone for him at home, and tell him his wild pranks have been way too extra to handle—and that your grace has been the shield between him and all that heat. imma keep it quiet here, so stick close to him.

HAMLET. [WITHIN.] mother, mother, mother.

QUEEN. i got you, don’t sweat it. bounce, i hear him coming.

[POLONIUS GOES BEHIND THE ARRAS.]

ENTER HAMLET.

HAMLET. so, mom, what’s up?

QUEEN. hamlet, you dissed your dad big time.

HAMLET. mom, you know you dissed my dad a ton too.

QUEEN. come on, come on, your answers are totally lazy.

HAMLET. yo, go chat with that savage tongue of yours.

QUEEN. like, what’s up, hamlet?

HAMLET. so, whatchu on about now?

QUEEN. you forget about me or whatevs?

HAMLET. nah, for real, you ain’t forgotten—you’re the queen, your husband’s bro’s wife, and even though it’s messy, you’re still my mom.

QUEEN. okay, then imma summon the word squad who can actually speak up.

HAMLET. come on, sit down—ain’t moving until i hook you up with a mirror so you can peep your true self.

QUEEN. what you gonna do? you ain’t about to off me, right? help, help, yo!

POLONIUS. [BEHIND.] yo, help! help! help!

HAMLET. hold up, a rat? [draws his weapon] dead for a ducat, dead!

[MAKES A PASS THROUGH THE ARRAS.]

POLONIUS. [BEHIND.] oh snap, i’m done for!

[FALLS AND DIES.]

QUEEN. oh no, what did you do?

HAMLET. nah, i dunno—is it the king?

[DRAWS FORTH POLONIUS.]

QUEEN. oh dear, what a wild and bloody move is this!

HAMLET. a straight-up bloody deed. almost as savage, dear mom, as offing a king and then marrying his bro.

QUEEN. like, off a king?

HAMLET. yeah, lady, that was my plan.— [to polonius] you pathetic, reckless, butt-in fool, peace out! i had high hopes for you. grab your fortune, ’cause bein’ too busy is kinda risky—stop flailing your hands. chill out, sit down, and let me mess with your heart, 'cause i will, if it’s soft enough; if bad habits haven’t made it all tough and impenetrable.

QUEEN. what did i even do that makes you run your mouth so harshly against me?

HAMLET. that kind of move that totally dims the glow and blush of true modesty, turning virtue into a hypocrite—like snatching the freshest rose off the glowing forehead of pure love and leavin’ a gnarly burn mark. it makes wedding vows as bogus as shady dice promises. oh, what a move that literally rips the soul out, makin’ sweet religion drop a bad remix of words. even heaven’s face lights up, but this chunky, overdone vibe, sporting a tragic look like it’s been hit with doom, is straight-up sickened by the act.

QUEEN. oh my, what move roars out and thunders like, right in the main thread?

HAMLET. peep this pic, and then peep that—it's like a fake display of two bros. check out the epic flex on that brow, with hyperion curls, jove-level front, and an eye that’s straight-up mars-ready to threaten and boss everyone around, all crowned with a mercury vibe on a hill that’s practically kissing the heavens—a combo so tight that every god stamped his seal to guarantee a real man. that was your hubby. now look at what comes next: here’s your husband, turned into a moldy ear dissing his solid bro. yo, do you even have eyes? would you really ditch that gourmet mountain to chow on this miserable moor? ha! come on—if you got eyes, you know that ain’t love; at your age, your hype blood’s gone tame, waiting for judgement. and what judgement could ever lift you from that peak to this pit? you’re supposed to have some sense, otherwise you wouldn’t even move; but clearly your sense is totally kaput, ’cause even madness wouldn’t slip up that badly—it saved a bit of its prime to flex in contrast. what savage trick did some devil play to hoodwink you so blind? eyes without feelin’, feelin’ without sight, ears missin’ their touch—like smellin’ with only half a sense—ain’t no half-dead vibe that could mope this hard. oh, shame! where’s your blush at? rebellious hell, if you can ever mutiny deep in a matron’s bones, let your hot youth treat virtue like melted wax dissolving in its own fire. don’t even flex shame when that wild passion drops the charge, since even frost can burn hard and reason totally panders to the hype.

QUEEN. oh hamlet, shut it down. you’re turning my eyes into a mirror of my soul, and i’m seeing such dark, stubborn stains that just won’t fade.

HAMLET. nah, it’s like livin’ in a gross, sweaty, messed-up bed, all marinated in corruption, drippin’ with fake sweet lovin’ over a nasty pigsty.

QUEEN. please, don’t speak to me like that anymore; your words stab my ears like daggers—enough, sweet hamlet.

HAMLET. a straight-up murderer and villain; a weak minion not even worth a fraction of the tribute of your old lord. a true vice of kings, a royal swindler who jacked the precious crown right off the shelf and stashed it in his pocket!

QUEEN. end it.

HAMLET. a king made of scraps and patch-ups!—

ENTER GHOST.

GHOST. yo, wrap me up with your wings, heavenly guards, and show off that sleek, gracious vibe of yours!

QUEEN. alas, he’s mad.

HAMLET. yo, aren’t you gonna call out your lagging son, who in a rush of fire lets your crucial orders slide? come on, spit it!

GHOST. don’t forget: this ghost drop is just to sharpen your nearly dulled purpose. but peep it—your mom’s sitting there, all amazed. step between her and that wild inner clash. even in the weakest bods, the craziest moves pop off. go on, talk to her, hamlet.

HAMLET. how’s it going with you, lady?

QUEEN. oh hamlet, how can you be so off—staring into a void and chatting up thin air? your eyes, like hyped-up soldiers in a snooze alarm, get all twitchy as your bed hair jumps like leftover scraps. oh gentle son, amid the heat and flame of your wild mood, sprinkle some cool patience. what exactly are you looking at?

HAMLET. i’m staring at him, fam—check how pale he glares, like his vibe and mission have fused into one so intense he could even get stones to wake up. but don’t look at me, or this pity might flip my icy exterior—then my move would lose its true color; maybe even turn tears into blood.

QUEEN. who exactly are you talking to?

HAMLET. you not seeing anything over there?

QUEEN. not a thing, but that’s all i see.

HAMLET. and you didn’t hear any of that?

QUEEN. nah, just us—nothing else.

HAMLET. yo, peep that over there! check how it slips away—my dad, in his iconic fit from back when he ruled! look, he’s even rolling out the gate now.

[EXIT GHOST.]

QUEEN. this is literally the brainchild of your noggin—this ghostly high is hella cunning.

HAMLET. damn, pure ecstasy! my heartbeat’s vibing in sync with yours like a fresh beat drop—and it ain’t madness what i just dropped. test me, and i’ll remix it perfectly; madness would just bounce away. mom, for love’s sake, don’t smear that fake, buttered-up sermon on your soul—that ain’t your sin, it’s my wild state talkin’. it just masks the raw, festering mess while deep corruption silently digs in. confess to heaven, repent for what’s past, dodge what’s comin’, and don’t spread that nasty compost on the weeds to make ‘em even ranker. forgive me for my pure vibe; in these fat, drama-filled times even virtue has gotta beg, hold back, and hustle just to do good.

QUEEN. oh hamlet, you’ve legit split my heart in two.

HAMLET. yo, just toss out the worst parts and let the pure half roll on. good night—but don’t end up in my uncle’s bed. fake a virtue if you ain’t got one. that toxic custom, which gobbles up all true sense with its evil habits, still drops a fresh outfit of actions that are fair and good. hold back tonight—that’ll ease you into your next clean break, 'cause practice almost rebrands you, either reining in the devil or booting him out with epic force. one more time, good night, and when you’re ready to be blessed, i’ll be over here sendin’ blessings your way. as for that same dude [POINTING TO POLONIUS]—i do repent, but heaven’s playing us, punishing me with this and me with that, so i gotta be their whip and fixer. i’ll settle him and own up to the death i dealt. so again, good night. i must be cruel, only to be kind. that’s how bad starts, and worse still lingers. one more word, good lady.

QUEEN. so, what should i even do?

HAMLET. no, seriously—not what i’m telling you to do. let that chunky king tempt you back to bed, smooch your cheek, call you his little mouse, and then, for a couple of gross kisses or his cursed fingers groping your neck, twist out all your tea. that’d show i ain’t truly mad for real, but just crazy in my craft. it’d be best if you let him know, ’cause who else but a queen—real, classy, wise—would hide such genuine feels in a paddock, a bat, or even some random gib? like, who would? nah—in spite of all sense and secrecy, unhook that basket from the rooftop, let the birds fly, and like that iconic ape fumbling in a basket, you might just end up breaking your own neck.

QUEEN. be assured, if words are made of breath and life, then i got no life left to breathe after hearing what you just said to me.

HAMLET. yo, i gotta bounce to england, you know that?

QUEEN. oh snap, i totally spaced that. it’s all set then.

HAMLET. i got letters all sealed up—and my two school homies, whom i trust like they’re fang’d vipers, carry the mandate. they gotta clear my path and lead me into some knavery. let it roll; it’s the ultimate flex to see the mastermind get hoisted by his own bomb, but i’m gonna dig one yard beneath their digs and blow ‘em straight to the moon. oh, it’s mad sweet when two slick moves collide in one line. this dude is gonna set me on the move. i’mma haul his guts into the neighbor’s room. mother, good night. seriously, that counselor was mad chill, super secret, and heavy—though in life he was just a foolish, chattering prankster. come on, sir, let’s wrap this up. good night, mother.

[EXIT HAMLET DRAGGING OUT POLONIUS.]
