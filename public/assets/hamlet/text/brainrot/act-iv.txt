ACT IV

SCENE I. A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

KING. there’s real tea in these heavy sighs—you gotta decode ‘em, ’cause we need the lowdown. where’s your son?

QUEEN. give us this spot for a sec, alright?

[TO ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN, WHO GO OUT.]

QUEEN. oh my lord, what a wild scene i just witnessed tonight!

KING. what’s up, gertrude? how’s hamlet?

QUEEN. he’s as cray as the sea and wind duking it out, legit. in one wild, lawless mood, while sneaking behind the arras to catch some tea, he whipped out his rapier, screamed “a rat, a rat!” and in his brain-fried frenzy offed the unseen old dude.

KING. oh damn, such a heavy deed! it would’ve gone down on us if we were there. his freedom now spells threat to everyone—to you, to us, to literally all. man, how are we gonna answer for this bloody mess? the blame’s gonna stick to us, since our watch was supposed to keep this mad lad in check, but our love for him made us blind, like someone hiding a nasty sickness by letting it feed right off the core of life. so, where did he vanish to?

QUEEN. to pull apart the body he offed—whose very madness, like raw ore among baser metals, ends up showing a weird purity—he’s crying over what he done.

KING. oh gertrude, let’s bounce! as soon as the sun touches the mountains, we’re shipping him off, and this vile deed we must cover up with all our royal finesse—yo, guildenstern!

RE-ENTER ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

KING. yo, squad, go grab some extra backup: hamlet, all mad and wild, just offed polonius and dragged him right out of his mom’s closet. go find him, chat him up real nice, and bring that body to the chapel—hustle it, fam.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

KING. come on, gertrude, let’s ring up our wisest peeps and spill the tea on what we plan to do and what went down too early—so any shady gossip, spread as evenly as a cannon’s blank shot across the globe, might overshoot us and hit nothing. oh, let’s bounce! my soul’s loaded with chaos and gloom.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE II. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER HAMLET.

HAMLET. all safe and stowed.

ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN. [WITHIN.] hamlet! lord hamlet!

HAMLET. what’s that noise? who’s calling hamlet? yo, here they come.

ENTER ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.

ROSENCRANTZ. what’ve you done with the dead body, my lord?

HAMLET. i’ve mixed it back up with dust, 'cause it’s all in the fam.

ROSENCRANTZ. let us know where it’s at so we can scoop it up and haul it to the chapel.

HAMLET. don’t even buy that.

ROSENCRANTZ. believe what, exactly?

HAMLET. that i can guard your secrets without trusting my own. plus, asking a sponge like me—what kind of duplicate can a king’s son even pull off?

ROSENCRANTZ. you taking me for a sponge, my lord?

HAMLET. yeah, dude; i’m that sponge—soakin’ up the king’s vibe, his perks, his power. and these lackeys end up serving the king best: he clutches ‘em like an ape grips its prey, first chatting with ‘em, then swallowing ‘em whole. when he craves what you’ve gathered, it’s just a squeeze, and boom—you’re dry again.

ROSENCRANTZ. i don’t get what you’re saying, my lord.

HAMLET. honestly, that’s good—a sneaky speech wasted on a dumb ear.

ROSENCRANTZ. my lord, you gotta tell us where the body is and come with us to the king.

HAMLET. the body’s with the king, but the king ain’t with the body. the king is just a thing—

GUILDENSTERN. a thing, indeed, my lord!

HAMLET. basically, nothing. get me to him. hush, fox, and the rest—move out.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE III. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER KING, ATTENDED.

KING. i sent out the squad to track him down and recover the body. how wild is it that this dude’s roaming free! but we can’t just drop the heavy law on him—he’s adored by the distracted crowd who judge by looks, not brains; so in cases like these, the punishment gets measured, not the crime. to keep everything smooth, this sudden exile of his gotta look like a calculated pause. wild diseases, grown desperate by desperate fixes, get cured—or don’t at all.

ENTER ROSENCRANTZ.

KING. but where’s he?

ROSENCRANTZ. he’s outside, my lord, on guard—waiting for your command.

KING. bring him in here.

ROSENCRANTZ. yo, guildenstern, bring in my lord.

ENTER HAMLET AND GUILDENSTERN.

KING. now, hamlet, where’s polonius?

HAMLET. he’s at supper.

KING. at supper? where?

HAMLET. not where he eats, but where he’s getting eaten. a squad of savvy worms is feasting on him. your worm is basically your only emperor when it comes to diet—we fatten all other creatures so they fatten us, and we get chubbed up for maggots. your chunky king and your skinny beggar are just two dishes on the same table. that’s the whole wrap.

KING. alas, alas!

HAMLET. a dude can fish with the worm that ate a king, and then chow down on the fish that dined on that worm, yo.

KING: what u mean by dis?

HAMLET: nothin’ but to show u how a king can flex by rollin’ through the guts of a beggar, no cap.

KING: where’s polonius?

HAMLET: he’s chillin’ in heaven, fam. send someone on up there to peep him. if your messenger can’t vibe with him, go on and search for him yourself. but fr, if u still don’t spot him by the end of this month, u better yeet him with a nosed bump as u slide up the stairs into the lobby.

KING: (to some attendants) go hunt him down out there.

HAMLET: he’ll just be posted till u roll up.

[EXEUNT ATTENDANTS.]

KING: hamlet, this move – for your extra safety, which we’re throwin’ at u while we’re mad grievin’ over what u did – means we gotta bounce u outta here with fiery speed. so prep up; the bark’s locked and loaded, the wind’s on deck, the squad’s ready, and everything’s prepped for england.

HAMLET: for england?

KING: ay, hamlet.

HAMLET: bet.

KING: that’s on point if u were down with our plan.

HAMLET: i peep a cherub watchin’ them. but aight, for england! peace out, dear mom.

KING: your lovin’ dad, hamlet.

HAMLET: my mom. dad and mom are like team one – one body, one vibe – so, my mom. come on, for england.

[EXIT.]

KING: trail him on foot. hustle him to board, no delays; i’m gonna yeet him out tonight. peace, cuz everything’s sealed and done – any slack and the whole affair’s at risk. so, make it snappy.

[EXEUNT ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN.]

KING: and england, if u got even a lil’ love for me – as my epic power might have u feel it, seein’ that your scar still looks raw and red from that danish sword and your free awe pays mad tribute – u can’t just ghost our royal plan that, by letters, spells out the instant death of hamlet. do it, england; cuz like a raging fever in my blood, he’s wild, and u gotta fix this mess. until i know it’s done, even if my luck’s off and my joys never got started.

[EXIT.]

SCENE IV. A PLAIN IN DENMARK.

ENTER FORTINBRAS AND FORCES MARCHING.

FORTINBRAS: yo, captain, go holla at the danish king for me. tell him that with his go-ahead, fortinbras is cravin’ to roll out a promised march over his kingdom. u know the meetup spot. if his majesty is down with us, we’ll flex our duty in his eyes; and let him know the vibe.

CAPTAIN: i’m on it, my lord.

FORTINBRAS: slide softly, fam.

[EXEUNT ALL BUT THE CAPTAIN.]

ENTER HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN & C.

HAMLET: yo, good sir, whose crew be these?

CAPTAIN: they’re from norway, sir.

HAMLET: so, what’s their mission, sir?

CAPTAIN: they’re out here against a part of poland.

HAMLET: who’s calling the shots on them, sir?

CAPTAIN: it’s the nephew of old norway, fortinbras.

HAMLET: so, is he goin’ after poland proper, or just some fringe, sir?

CAPTAIN: real talk, we’re just tryna snag a tiny patch of land that’s only hyped for its name. payin’ five ducats – like, five – i wouldn’t even farm that shiz; it won’t score a high rate for norway or the pols if sold.

HAMLET: so, obviously, the polack ain’t gonna defend it.

CAPTAIN: yup, it’s already got a squad on lock.

HAMLET: two thousand homies and twenty thou ducats ain’t gonna debate over some straw, fr! this is the bogus flex of mad wealth and peace – breakin’ in on the inside with no legit reason for a man’s death. mad thanks, sir.

CAPTAIN: god be with u, sir.

[EXIT.]

ROSENCRANTZ: will it please you to bounce, my lord?

HAMLET: i’ll catch up with u straight – go ahead a sec.

[EXEUNT ALL BUT HAMLET.]

HAMLET: how every single vibe is callin’ me out and pushin’ my dull revenge game. like, what even is a man if his only grind is to sleep and chow down? basically, an animal, no cap. the dude who made us with all that deep convo – plannin’ ahead and lookin’ back – didn’t hook us up with that epic, godlike brainpower to chill unused. whether it’s straight-up bestial oblivion or some scared overthinkin’ that’s like one part wisdom and three parts pure cowardice, i literally don’t know why i’m still here sayin’ i gotta act when i got the cause, the will, the strength, and the means. heavy examples, like this massive army charged by a soft, tender prince whose spirit, all puffed up with divine ambition, is flexin’ at unseen events and exposin’ the mortal, sketchy truths to everything from fortune to death to danger – even for an eggshell – show me that being great ain’t about making moves without drama; it’s about finding beef in a piece of straw when honor’s on the line. so, where do i stand when i’ve had my father clapped, my mom dissed, and all that fire in my blood and reason just put to sleep, while i watch in shame as twenty thousand dudes get yeeted to their graves for a fame fantasy, fightin’ for some plot that no one can even argue about ‘cause it ain’t even a proper tomb? o, from now on, my thoughts gotta be drenched in blood or be totally worthless.

[EXIT.]

SCENE V. ELSINORE. A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER QUEEN, HORATIO AND A GENTLEMAN.

QUEEN: i ain’t gonna talk to her.

GENTLEMAN: she’s mad desperate and extra af – her mood’s straight-up worthy of pity.

QUEEN: so, what is she even gonna have?

GENTLEMAN: she goes off about her dad non-stop; says she hears there’s shady tricks in the world, gets all her heart beatin’ and throws envious shade at random straw, spittin’ stuff that only makes half sense. her speech is basically nothin’, but the way she tosses it around has listeners trying to piece it together, remixin’ her words to fit their own vibes. with her winks, nods, and gestures, it kinda makes u think there’s depth there – though it’s a hot mess. it’d be smart to have a proper heart-to-heart with her ‘cause she might drop some dangerous tea in already jumbled minds.

QUEEN: let her in.

[EXIT GENTLEMAN.]

to my sick soul, as sin’s true essence, every little plaything feels like the intro to a major screw-up. guilt’s so raw and jealous it literally overflows out of fear of bein’ spilled.

[ENTER OPHELIA.]

OPHELIA: where’s denmark’s beauteous majesty?

QUEEN: hey, ophelia, what’s good?

OPHELIA: [sings] how should i know your true love from another one? just peep his cockle hat, his stick, and his sandal shoon.

QUEEN: alas, sweet lady, what’s the tea with this song?

OPHELIA: say u? nah, listen up – [sings] he’s dead and gone, lady, he’s dead and gone; with grass for a crown at his head and a stone chillin’ at his heels.

QUEEN: nah, but ophelia—

OPHELIA: listen up – [sings] his shroud’s white like mountain snow, no cap.

[ENTER KING.]

QUEEN: alas, peep this, my lord!

OPHELIA: [sings] they carried him barefac’d on the bier – hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny – and on his grave, tears rained hard. farewell, my dove!

KING: how u doin’, pretty lady?

OPHELIA: well, god dild you! they say the owl was a baker’s daughter. lord, we know what we are, but don’t know what we might become – god be at your table!

KING: major flex on her dad.

OPHELIA: please, let’s not chat about that; but if they ask what it means, just hit ‘em with: [sings] tomorrow is saint valentine’s day, all in the early morn, and i’m a maid at your window, ready to be your valentine.

then up he rose, donned his threads, and flung the chamber door open, letting in the maid who, once a maid, never left again.

KING: pretty ophelia!

OPHELIA: straight up, no oath needed – i’m gonna end it. [sings] by gis and by saint charity, alack, and fie for shame! young men will do it if they come around; by cock, they’re totally at fault. she added, before u totally tumbled me, u promised to wed me. so i would've been down, by that sun, if u hadn’t come to my bed.

KING: how long’s she been on this vibe?

OPHELIA: i hope everything works out. we gotta be patient, but i can’t help but cry thinkin’ they’d just lay him in the cold ground. my brother’s gonna hear about it. so, thanks for the solid advice. come, my coach! goodnight, ladies; goodnight, sweet ladies; goodnight, goodnight.

[EXIT.]

KING: follow her close; watch her tight, i’m beggin’ u.

[EXIT HORATIO.]

KING: yo, this is the deep poison of grief – it all starts with her dad’s death. oh gertrude, gertrude, when the sorrows roll in, they ain’t just sneaky little spies – they come in full-on battalions. first, her dad got clapped; next, your son dipped; and that dude even went full savage on himself by offing his own worth. the people are all muddled and thick in their drama over good polonius’ death, and we only half-assed the whole interment. poor ophelia, split from herself and her sharp judgment – without which we’re just like emojis or straight-up beasts. and last, as extra as these get, her brother snuck back from france, feedin’ on his own wonder and floatin’ in his clouds, not needin’ any buzzers to mess up his ear with pestilent updates about his dad’s death – so much so that nothin’ in us sticks to blame over and over. oh my dear gertrude, this whole scene, like a murder remix in a bunch of spots, is givin’ me superfluous death vibes.

[A NOISE WITHIN.]

QUEEN: alas, what noise is dis?

KING: where are my switzers? get ‘em to guard the door.

[ENTER A GENTLEMAN.]

what’s goin’ on?

GENTLEMAN: save yourself, my lord. the ocean, overpeepin’ its list, ain’t gobblin’ the flats with more savage speed than young laertes, who’s out here in riot mode, overrunnin’ your scene. the rabble’s callin’ him lord, and like, since the world feels like it’s just kickin’ off – old vibes ghosted, customs forgotten – the squad of validators and props are screamin’ “choose us! laertes shall be king!” with caps, hands, and tongues all hyped to the skies, shoutin’ “laertes shall be king, laertes king!”

QUEEN: how cheerfully they’re on this bogus trail. oh, dis is messed up, y’all false danish dogs.

[A NOISE WITHIN.]

KING: the doors are busted.

[ENTER LAERTES, ARMED; DANES FOLLOWING.]

LAERTES: where’s this king at? sirs, y’all stand outside.

DANES: nah, let’s come in.

LAERTES: please, let me through.

DANES: we will, we will.

[EXEUNT, LEAVING THE DOOR.]

LAERTES: thanks, keep the door. oh, you vile king, hand over my father.

QUEEN: now, chill, good laertes.

LAERTES: that one drop of chill blood screams that i’m a bastard; it calls my dad a cuckold and brands my mom as a hoe, even on her pure, unsullied brow.

KING: what’s the deal, laertes, that your uprising is lookin’ so massive? – let her go, gertrude. don’t sweat us. a king’s got so much divine backup that treason can only sneak a peek at his will. tell me, laertes, why u are so fired up. – let her go, gertrude. – speak, man.

LAERTES: where’s my father?

KING: dead.

QUEEN: but not his fault.

KING: let him demand his due.

LAERTES: how’d he die? i’m not here to get juggled. to hell with allegiance! vows to the blackest devil! conscience and grace to the deepest pit! i dare damnation. i’m at this point where i give both worlds the slip – let whatever come – but i swear, i’ll be mad thorough in avenging my father.

KING: who can stop you?

LAERTES: just my own will, not everyone. and with my resources, i’ll stretch ‘em so far, even if it’s low-key.

KING: alright laertes, if u wanna be sure about your dear father’s death, is it written in your revenge plan that you’ll, no cap, take out both your homies and foes, winners and losers alike?

LAERTES: only his enemies.

KING: u gonna know who they are then?

LAERTES: i’ll open my arms wide to his so-called good friends; and like a life-givin’ pelican, i’ll serve ’em a feast of my blood.

KING: damn, now you speak like a good kid and a true gentleman. given that i’m totally guiltless of your father’s death and madly grieving it, it should be as obvious to you as day is to your eyes.

DANES: [within] let her in.

LAERTES: what’s that noise?

[RE-ENTER OPHELIA, FANTASTICALLY DRESSED WITH STRAWS AND FLOWERS.]

LAERTES: oh damn, dry up my brain. tears, like seven times salty, burn out all sense and virtue from my eyeballs. by heaven, your madness should be charged by weight until our scales flip the beam. oh rose of may, dear maid, kind sis, sweet ophelia! oh heavens, can a young girl's wits really be as mortal as an old dude's life? nature’s all fine when it comes to love, and when it’s on point, it drops a precious snippet of itself after the one it loves.

OPHELIA: [sings] they carried him barefac’d on the bier, hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny, and on his grave, tears rained down – farewell, my dove!

LAERTES: if u had your wits and actually went for revenge, it wouldn’t be like this.

OPHELIA: u gotta sing “down a-down, and then call him a-down-a.” oh, how the wheel fits, right? it’s the fake steward who jacked his master’s daughter.

LAERTES: this sh*t is nothing more than matter.

OPHELIA: there’s rosemary for remembrance; pray, love, remember. and there are pansies for thoughts.

LAERTES: that’s a mind-document, all madness, thoughts, and remembrance, fitted together.

OPHELIA: there’s fennel for u, and columbines. there’s rue for you, and here’s some for me. we can call it the herb of grace on sundays. oh, u gotta wear your rue with some flair. here’s a daisy. i’d give u some violets, but they all withered when my father died. they say he made a good end. [sings] for bonny sweet robin is all my joy.

LAERTES: thought, pain, passion – even straight-up hell – she turns all that into favor and beauty.

OPHELIA: [sings] and will he not come again? and will he not come again? nah, nah, he’s dead, go to your deathbed, he’ll never come again. his beard was as white as snow and his hair all flaxen. he’s gone, he’s gone, and we’re done with the moanin’. god have mercy on his soul, and on all christian souls, i pray god – god be with ye.

[EXIT.]

LAERTES: do u see dis, oh god?

KING: laertes, i must vibe with your grief or else u’re denying me my right. step aside and pick your wisest homies; let them listen and decide between you and me. if they find, whether straight up or on the side, that we’re linked, we’ll hand over our kingdom, our crown, our life, and all we call ours to you as satisfaction; but if not, be content and lend us your patience, and we’ll jointly grind with your soul to give you proper contentment.

LAERTES: let it be; his means of death, his vague burial – no trophy, sword, or flashy display on his bones, no noble rite or formal show – should shout out loud, as if from heaven to earth, that i must call it into question.

KING: so you will. and where the offense is, let the big axe fall. please, come with me.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE VI. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER HORATIO AND A SERVANT.

HORATIO: what are these people who wanna speak with me?

SERVANT: sailors, sir. they say they got letters for you.

HORATIO: let ‘em in.

[EXIT SERVANT.]

i don’t even know from which corner of the globe i should be greeted if it isn’t from lord hamlet.

[ENTER SAILORS.]

FIRST SAILOR: god bless you, sir.

HORATIO: let him bless thee too.

FIRST SAILOR: he will, sir, if that pleases him. there’s a letter for you, sir. it’s from the ambassador who was headed to england, if your name be horatio, as i been told.

HORATIO: [reads] "horatio, when u’ve scrolled past dis, hook these dudes up with a way to get to the king – they got letters for him. less than two days into our sea trip, a full-on pirate with mad war vibes chased us. our sails were hella slow, so we had to flex forced valor; in the scrap, i boarded them. as soon as they bounced from our ship, i ended up bein’ their only captive. they treated me like heartless thieves – but they knew what they did; i owe them a solid. let the king peep the letters i sent, and hurry back to me as fast as u’d flee death. i got some words to drop in your ear that’ll leave u speechless; but tbh, they’re too light for the heavy deets. these solid bros will bring u to me. rosencrantz and guildenstern are cruisin’ off to england – got mad tea to spill about them. peace out. he that u know, your own hamlet."

come on, i’ll show u the way for these letters, and do it hella fast so u can direct me to the dude who dropped ‘em off.

[EXEUNT.]

SCENE VII. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

ENTER KING AND LAERTES.

KING: now your conscience gotta vibe that i’m all good with u, and u need to have me in your squad as a friend, since u’ve heard – with a knowing ear – that the one who offed your noble father went after my life.

LAERTES: it’s clear. but tell me, why didn’t u go off on these wild moves so shockingly criminal and capital in nature, even though u were totally hyped by your safety, your wisdom, and all that jazz?

KING: oh, for two legit reasons – which might seem kinda weak to u, but trust me, they’re strong for me. first, the queen – his mother – is basically livin’ off his looks; and as for me – whether my virtue is a blessing or a curse – she’s so intertwined with my life and soul that, like, as the star only moves in its own lane, i can’t do without her. the other reason, why i couldn’t go public, is ‘cause the general crowd’s got mad love for him – they dip all his faults in affection like the spring that turns wood to stone, flippin’ his chains into grace; so that my arrows – too slim to cut through a loud, wild wind – would’ve just bounced back to my bow instead of hittin’ where i aimed.

LAERTES: and now i lost my noble father, and my sister got pushed into desperate vibes – her worth, if we could rewind the praises, was challengin’ the top for her perfections. but my revenge is gonna drop soon.

KING: don’t sweat it. don’t think we’re so flat and boring that we let our beard get rocked by danger like it’s a joke. u’ll hear more soon. i loved your father, and we love ourselves – and i hope that shows u what to imagine…

[ENTER A MESSENGER.]

KING: how u do, what’s the update?

MESSENGER: letters, my lord, from hamlet. one for your majesty; one for the queen.

KING: from hamlet! who brought ‘em?

MESSENGER: sailors, my lord, i didn’t see ‘em. they were handed to me by claudio, who got them from the one who brought them.

KING: laertes, you’re gonna hear ‘em. y’all, exit.

[EXIT MESSENGER.]

[reads] "high and mighty, u shall know i am set naked on your kingdom. tomorrow shall i beg leave to peep your kingly eyes. when i do, after asking your pardon, i’ll spill the tea on the occasions of my sudden and extra-strange return. hamlet."

KING: what does this even mean? did they all come back, or is it just some abuse with nothing real?

LAERTES: do u know whose hand that is?

KING: it’s hamlet’s own style – “naked!” and in a ps he says “alone.” can u advise me?

LAERTES: i’m totally lost in dis, my lord. but let him come; it fires up the sickness in my heart that i’ll live and tell him straight to his face, “thus, u die.”

KING: if that’s the case, laertes – how else would it be? – will u let me rule u?

LAERTES: yes, my lord; so u won’t overrule me into some lame peace.

KING: mind your own peace. if he’s now returned, rechecking his voyage and decidin’ to bounce, i’ll set him up for an exploit, ripe in my plan, under which he won’t have a choice but to fall; and for his death, no wind will whisper – even his own mama will offload the blame and call it an accident.

LAERTES: my lord, i’m cool with u rule, as long as u set it up so i can be the main tool for it.

KING: that’s perfect. you’ve been talked about a lot since u traveled, and even in hamlet’s ear – for that quality they say makes you shine – your whole package didn’t pull as strong envy from him as did that one, and that, in my view, of the unworthiest attack.

LAERTES: what part is that, my lord?



KING. yo, check it – youth is that epic flex on your cap, a dope ribbon that’s essential, ‘cause the chill drip of youth beats the crusty, all-dark vibes of old age any day. two months back, this norman dude rolled in – i even clocked him when i was fightin’ the french – and while the french were basically elite in the horseback game, this gallant was straight-up witchcraft level. he leveled up his ride so perfectly it was like he and his horse were one, legit in-sync as if they were on the same livestream. my brain was shook ‘cause no matter how many tricks i tried to fake, i couldn’t even come close to his next-level move.

LAERTES. a norman, was’t?

KING. a norman.

LAERTES. upon my life, lamord.

KING. literally the same dude.

LAERTES. i know him well – he’s the icon, the total flex and shining gem of the whole nation.

KING. yo, he totally spilled the tea on you, dropping a masterclass in defense art and rapier skills – like, he shouted “it’d be lit if anyone could match your game.” he even swore that the enemy squad was straight-up noobs – zero movement, no guard, no eye – when you rolled up. so much so that hamlet got mega salty, only able to be jelly and beg for your instant challenge. now, out of this,—

LAERTES. what out of this, my lord?

KING. laertes, tell me – was your dad your ride-or-die, or are you just a whole walking sad meme, a portrait of sorrow with zero heart?

LAERTES. why you askin’ that?

KING. not that i doubt your love for your pops, but i’m feelin’ that love kicks off with time – and over time, even the hottest flame gets dimmed by little snuffs in the wick. in that fire of love, there’s always some lowkey factor that chokes it out; even the purest goodness can overdo itself and flare out. if we were to do what we really want, we’d do it straight-up – but “would” is always trippin’, with delays and side quests as endless as the number of tongues, hands, and random accidents out there. and then this “should” is like a whiny, extra sigh that actually hurts things instead. but hey, zooming in: hamlet’s back now – so what savage move are you gonna drop to show you’re your father’s true son in action rather than just in words?

LAERTES. imma yeet his throat right in church.

KING. no cap – there’s no sacred spot for murder, revenge knows no limits. so, laertes, if you’re down for this, crash in your chamber, and when hamlet bounces back, he’ll know you’re home. we’ll hype you up so hard that everyone praises your excellence and we double-gloss the clout the french dude gave you, bundling it all together and betting on your head game. since hamlet’s been too chill and generous to be scheming, he won’t be checking the details – so you can just slide, pick a fresh, unbated sword, and in one smooth practice round, serve up epic revenge for your dad.

LAERTES. bet, i’ll do it. i’m even anointin’ my sword for the job. i copped some sick potion from a mountebank – so lethal that a knife-dip in it, once it draws blood, is so deadly no rare healing gel gathered from all the moonlit herbs can save it. it’s just a scratch normally, but i’m gonna dip my tip in that contagion so that even a slight cut sends him straight to the afterlife.

KING. aight, let’s brainstorm this further – weigh up the time and resources that suit our vibe. if this plan flops and our act ends up lookin’ like total trash, then it’s better not to even try. so, here’s the tea: we’re setting up a backup plan that’ll hold if this blow-up works. soft, check this out: we’ll make a solemn wager on your cunning – yes, i’m down for that! when you’re hyped and go in hot, making your moves super savage, and if hamlet ends up callin’ for a drink, i’ll have a chalice prepped on the spot so that after one sip, if he somehow dodges your toxic strike, our plan still lands.

ENTER QUEEN.

HOW NOW, SWEET QUEEN?

QUEEN. yo, one heartache is chasing another like a nonstop meme chain – and your sis, laertes, has straight-up drowned.

LAERTES. drown’d? damn, where did that go down?

QUEEN. over by that willow chillin’ sideways along a brook – its frosty leaves reflecting in that glassy stream. there, she made up some wild garlands of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples – names that even extra shepherds can’t handle, though our ice-cold maids just call ‘em dead men’s fingers. on those droopy branches, her little weed crown was clinging on, until a jealous branch snapped, and boom – her weed crown and she both took a dive into the weepy brook. her clothes spread out, and like a mermaid for a hot minute, they lifted her up while she hummed old, faded tunes, as if she wasn’t even feeling her own distress, or like she was totally at home with nature. but it couldn’t last long – her drenched garb eventually dragged the poor babe from her melodic vibe to a muddy death.

LAERTES. damn, so she’s legit drowned?

QUEEN. drown’d, drown’d.

LAERTES. bro, ophelia got way too much water – so imma hold back my tears. but still, it’s just nature doing its thing; let shame talk all it wants. once the tears dry up, the lady will be gone. adieu, my lord – i had this blazing speech ready, but this whole mess just killed its fire.

[EXIT.]

KING. aight, let’s roll after gertrude; i put in mad work to chill his rage, and now i’m sweatin’ that it might spark up again, so let’s bounce.

[EXEUNT.]
