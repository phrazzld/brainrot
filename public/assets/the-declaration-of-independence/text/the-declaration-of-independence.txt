yo peep this declaration of absolute vibeshift, fr fr. when a squad’s gotta yeet their political exes and level up to their main character arc cuz the universe said "bet," basic respect demands they explain the tea.  

we’re just gonna say it: these facts are straight bussin’ no cap—everybody’s born with main character energy, stacked with rizz from the divine, including Ws like life, freedom, and the grind for serotonin. governments? just group projects we start to protect those vibes, and if the project’s toxic, we *will* cancel it and start a new server. prudence says don’t ragequit over mid drama—but if the opps keep dunking on you with cringe after cringe, manifesting total Ls? slay the system. that’s us rn. king george iii’s whole career is a highlight reel of fails. let’s unpack:  

- bro vetoed our glow-up laws like a hater.  
- made governors sit on urgent bills until they rotted in drafts.  
- ghosted whole communities unless they ditched their reps (sus).  
- called legislative meetups in cursed locations (no wifi, mid seating) to softlock democracy.  
- kept dissolving congress like "nah, try again sweaty."  
- left states on read for elections, leaving us vulnerable to chaos mode.  
- nerfed immigration, blocked land grants, basically said "no new players."  
- let the justice system crash (no updates, devs asleep).  
- let judges get fired for vibes, not performance reviews.  
- spawned infinite bureaucrats to tax our ramen money.  
- parked random military dudes in our cribs during peacetime (no consent).  
- simped for the army over civilian chill.  
- collabed with randos to impose whack laws, like:  
  • forcing us to host redcoat sleepovers.  
  • letting their ops slide after capping civilians (fake trials, lol).  
  • blocking our global tradeships.  
  • taxing our avocado toast without asking.  
  • canceling jury duty rights.  
  • yeeting us overseas for bogus charges.  
  • replacing based english law with cringe dictatorship dlc nearby.  
  • deleting our charters, nuking our best laws, rebooting our govs.  
  • suspending our congress and going "we’ll handle it, peasants."  

king george then ragequit our dm, declared war, and started:  
- pirating our seas, burning villages, ratio-ing civilians.  
- shipping in mercenary armies for maximum cringe (war crimes? in 1776? mid).  
- forcing captured homies to fight their own squad (ick).  
- starting beef with locals, siccing merciless tribes on our borders (not chill).  

we slid into dms for months—all read receipts, no reply. mans is a walking red flag.  

shoutout to the uk homies tho! we @‘d them about their gov’s cringe moves, reminded them we’re family—they left us on delivered. so we’re unfriending.  

we, the united states’ main council, vibing with god as our mutual, hereby scream into the void: we’re free, independent, and ghosting britain’s crown. we can now yeet into wars, sign collabs, hustle trades, and flex as a sovereign server. for this big bet, we’re all in—no take-backsies, pinky promise—on our lives, our stonks, and our eternal clout.
