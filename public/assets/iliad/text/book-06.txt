yap for me muse, spill that fresh tea of war
where trojans and achaean squads went full send, no chill:
sharp bronze glinting between simois and xanthos,
spears vibing in mid-air, each side thirsting for frags.

first up, aias—my man’s a walking wall, an *absolute* fortress—
broke trojan lines like they were lego sets,
gave a big morale buff to his day-one homies
by dropping akamas (thracian top-dog, huge rep out east).
aias’s spear went skull-deep through that horsehair crest,
and darkness closed akamas’s eyes like *that*.

then diomedes, that unstoppable g, found axylos—
dude from arisbē, smooth-living, philanthropic legend—
dropped him anyway, plus his ride-or-die charioteer.
turns out open-handed hospitality doesn’t buy you extra life in war.

eurylos bagged drēsos and opheltios,
slid on aesēpos and pedasos, twin spawns of a river-nymph and boukolion.
these kids had the luck to be half-god once,
but homie, in the brawl, they got zero plot armor.

like a gamer looting noobs, mekistiades’ son
ripped their fancy gear right off, shining in the sun.

polypoitēs took down astyalos,
odysseus stuck pidytēs in the chest,
teukros finished off aretaon,
antilochos sniped ableros, and lord agamemnon nailed elatos,
who once chilled by the satnioeis river’s leafy banks.
lēitos ended phylakos as he tried to scurry,
and eurypylos took melanthios’s final breath.

menelaos, that war-shout champion, caught adrēstos alive—
horses had freaked and left him face-planting in the dust.
he clutched menelaos’s knees: “bro, i got you, i’ll pay hefty ransom.”
menelaos considered mercy 'til agamemnon came in hot:
“bro, we’re not vibing with mercy. every trojan’s gotta get bodied,
down to the last baby.” menelaos shrugs,
shoves adrēstos away, and the king stabs him right in the gut,
yanks his spear out with a stomp to the chest. savage vibes.

nestor—old pilot of war—yelled,
“argives, keep pushing, no stopping for loot yet,
wipe ‘em first, strip ‘em later. trust, we’ll have time.”
that lit up everyone’s fighting spirit,
and trojans almost retreated behind their walls,
but helenos, priam’s eagle-eyed prophet,
sidled up to aeneas and hector, saying:
“it’s on you two, bravest in troy.
hold the line, keep the squads from meltdown.
hector, run into town, tell mom to gather the old ladies,
hit up gray-eyed athena with the biggest, prettiest robe,
promise a dozen top-tier cows.
beg the goddess to cool diomedes’s jets—
that man’s more savage than achilles, i swear.”

hector hopped off his chariot, gleaming in full kit,
roused his trojans with big shouts.
the argives paused, thinking maybe a god had dropped in.
hector told them, “hang tight, i gotta check in at the city,
but keep the vibe strong 'til i bounce back.”
and off he marched, that plumed helmet bobbing,
like a meteor swirling in war’s dusty gloom.

diomedes then locked eyes with glaukos,
both about to throw hands in the middle.
diomedes spoke first: “hey friend, i don’t know you,
but you’re acting real bold.
if you’re a god, i’m not messing with that.
if you’re mortal, come at me,
but you might catch a quick trip to the afterlife.”

glaukos fired back: “why the lineage check, man?
humans are like leaves—one season here, next season dust.
but fine, i hail from sisyphos’s cunning blood,
with bellerophontēs my granddaddy, champion blessed but exiled,
had to kill the chimera, fought the amazons, overcame every trap.
he ended up a hero-king in lycia, but fell from the gods’ grace.
my father hippolokhos told me to show up, do him proud.
that’s me, rocking our legacy.”

diomedes grinned, stuck his spear butt-down,
“so we’re guest-friends from way back? bet.
my old man had ties to your grandpa.
let’s not kill each other. plenty of trojans for me to smite,
plenty of achaean necks for you to slice.
we’ll swap gear, show the world we’re tight.”
they clasp hands, sealed the bond,
but zeus scrambled glaukos’s wits,
so he gave away gold armor for diomedes’s cheap bronze.
that’s what the gods do sometimes, no cap.

hector reached the scaean gates—
trojan wives swarmed him, pleading for news.
he told them: “pray to the gods, i gotta handle stuff.”
he found queen hecuba in priam’s splendid halls,
she offered him sweet wine for a quick prayer,
but he was like, “no thanks, i’m covered in gore.
just gather the old ladies, take your best, biggest robe,
lay it on athena’s knees, vow twelve yearling cows.
maybe she’ll shield our city from diomedes.
i gotta go drag paris outta bed.”

hecuba did exactly that, grabbed a star-bright sidonian robe
(paris had brought it when he hijacked helen),
led the old trojan matriarchs to athena’s temple.
theano, the priestess, unlocked the holy doors,
they placed the shining cloth on the goddess’s lap,
prayed for mercy, but pallas turned her face away,
like “nah sis, not today.”

hector marched to paris’s fancy crib,
found him in the bedroom with his gear half-done,
helen weaving in the background.
hector roasted him: “people are dying out there, because of YOU,
and here you are preening?”
paris was like, “yeah, i know i messed up,
but i’m heading out now, i promise.
helen talked me into it. you go ahead, i’ll catch up.”
hector just huffed, ignoring him.
helen sighed, calling herself a dog, wishing she’d vanished at birth.
she tried to get hector to sit, but he shook his head:
“nah, i gotta see my family real quick, then run back to the fray.”

he found andromachē not at home but on the tower,
holding their baby boy, little astyanax (though hector calls him scamandrios).
she wept, “your fierce courage’s gonna kill you.
my dad, my brothers are gone. you’re all i have.
fight here by the fig tree where the wall is weak,
so maybe we won’t lose you.”
hector sighed heavy: “i can’t hide from war,
i’d be ashamed. i know troy will fall, i dread seeing you taken captive.
i pray i’m buried first so i don’t watch you cry as a slave.”
he kissed his son, who recoiled from the shining crest.
both parents cracked a sad smile,
and hector prayed to zeus: “make my boy strong,
so one day they say, ‘he’s bigger than dad.’”
he handed him back, softly told andromachē:
“don’t wreck yourself with grief. fate spares no one.
just keep your tasks at home, let men do the battles.”
then he placed the helmet back on,
and she turned away in tears,
followed by her maids, mourning him alive, certain he’d never return.

meanwhile, paris, shining like a stallion freed from the stable,
came sprinting with bouncing steps, hair flying,
caught up to hector at the gate.
he tried to apologize for the delay,
hector just rolled his eyes: “no real warrior would bail on the fight.
you’ve got skill, but your vibe’s always slipping.
the trojans talk mad trash about you,
but okay, let’s see if zeus might bless us to drive these achaean dudes off,
so we can raise a real free-flowing toast in our own halls.”

and that’s how book six rides off into the dust,
with hector stepping forth again, doom on the horizon.
