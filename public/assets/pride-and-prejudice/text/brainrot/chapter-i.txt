chapter i.

it is a truth universally acknowledged, like the dankest viral meme, that a single man ballin’ with a fat fortune is lowkey on the hunt for a wifey.

no matter how little his feels or opinions are when he first slides into a new neighborhood, this truth is so deep in the minds of the local fam that they instantly see him as prime property for one of their daughters.

“my dear mr. bennet,” his lady chirped one day, “you heard that netherfield park got snatched up at last?”

mr. bennet shot back, “nah, i hadn’t peeped it.”

“but it totally is,” she clapped, “mrs. long just rolled through and spilled all the tea.”

mr. bennet left it on read.

“don’t ya wanna know who flexed and took it?” his wife demanded, all impatient.

“spill the deets, i’m all ears.”

“he dipped down to check out the spot.”

that was invitation enough.

“omg, babe, you gotta know—mrs. long says netherfield’s been scooped up by a young dude with major north-of-england cash; he rolled in on monday in a chaise-and-four, scoped the crib, and was so stoked he sealed the deal with mr. morris on the spot; he’s set to claim the pad before michaelmas, and his squad’s moving in by the end of next week.”

“what’s his name?”

“bingley.”

“is he hitched or still solo?”

“oh, totally solo, my dear! a single dude with mad fortune—like, pulling in four or five grand a year. what a glow-up that would be for our girls!”

“how does that even affect them?”

“my dear mr. bennet, how can you be so extra? you know i’m lowkey plotting to get one of our girls hitched to him.”

“is that his whole vibe for settling here?”

“vibe? lol, nonsense—seriously, he’s probs gonna catch feels for one of ‘em, so you gotta roll up to see him as soon as he lands.”

“i don’t see the need for that. you and the girls can go—or better yet, send them on their own, which might actually be a win; since you’re as fine as any of them, mr. bingley might end up vibing with you the most.”

“omg, babe, you’re flattering me. i’ve had my beauty days, but i ain’t tryna be extra now. when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she should chill with obsessing over her own looks.”

“in cases like that, a woman usually doesn’t even have much extra glow to worry about.”

“but, my dear, you absolutely must go see mr. bingley when he crashes into the neighborhood.”

“i’m booked, i assure you.”

“but think about your daughters—imagine what a major upgrade it’d be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are already hyped to come just for that reason; normally, they wouldn’t even bother with new faces. seriously, you must go, ‘cause if you don’t, we won’t even have a shot to visit him.”

“you’re being too extra, for real. i bet mr. bingley will be stoked to see you; and i’ll even slide him a note vouching for him marrying any one of our girls—though i gotta throw in a sweet plug for my little lizzy.”

“i’m telling you, don’t do that. lizzy ain’t any better than the rest—she’s not even half as cute as jane, or as chiller as lydia. yet you always play favorites.”

“hon, none of 'em are particularly epic; they’re all pretty basic, but lizzy’s got a spark that outshines her sisters.”

“mr. bennet, how can you roast your own kids like this? you literally live for vexing me. you got zero chill for my poor nerves.”

“you got it twisted, my dear. i hold mad respect for your nerves—they’ve been my ride-or-die for, like, twenty years now.”

“oh, you don’t know the struggle i go through.”

“but i hope you get past it and live to see tons of dudes making four grand a year roll into our hood.”

“it’s useless if twenty of them show up and you still ghost them.”

“trust, my dear, when there are twenty, imma hit up every single one.”

mr. bennet was such a wild mix of quick wit, savage sarcasm, chill reserve, and random mood swings that even after twenty-three years, his wife still couldn’t decode his vibe. her mind was way more basic—a true woman of limited insight, minimal tea, and sketchy mood swings. whenever she got upset, she swore she was all in her nerves. her entire life revolved around getting her daughters married, and her safe space was all about visits and juicy gossip.
