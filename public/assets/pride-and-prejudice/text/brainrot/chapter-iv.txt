chapter iv.

then, with jane and elizabeth on their own, jane – who had been playing it safe with her mr. bingley praise earlier – confessed to her sister just how much she was lowkey crushing on him.

“he is literally the blueprint for a young man,” she declared, “sensible, chill, and hella lively; i’ve never peeped such smooth, happy manners – so effortless, with the dopest good breeding!”

“plus, he’s a total snack,” elizabeth replied, “and any young man should be all that too if he can swing it. his character just ties it all together.”

“i was super shook when he asked me to dance a second time. i wasn’t even expecting that level of compliment.”

“didn’t i? i totally got the same vibes for you. but that’s one huge diff between us. compliments always catch you off guard, while i’m straight chill about it. like, what could be more natural than him asking you again? he obviously peeped that you were like five times prettier than every other girl in the room – and that wasn’t even thanks to his fancy moves. yeah, he’s mad agreeable, and i won’t stop you from liking him – you’ve been down with way dumber peeps before.”

“dear lizzy!”

“oh, you’re way too chill when it comes to liking folks. you literally never see a flaw in anyone. in your eyes, everyone’s pure gold. i’ve never even heard you throw shade at a single soul.”

“i try not to rush into judging anyone; but i always keep it 100 with what i think.”

“i know you do – and that’s what blows my mind. with your solid sense, you're honestly blind to all the goofy antics of others! fake, over-the-top honesty is everywhere, but to be genuinely candid without the extra flex—to just boost everyone’s good vibes and ignore all the negatives—that’s a next level move that only you can pull off. and btw, you’re into this dude’s sisters too, right? because, honestly, their manners just don’t match his.”

“nah, not really at first; but they turn out to be pretty dope once you actually talk to them. like, miss bingley’s gonna be living with her bro and running his crib, and i’d be totally shocked if we didn’t end up with a charming neighbor in her.”

elizabeth just sat there in silence, not buying their whole vibe. their behavior at the party was clearly not curated to impress everyone; and with her sharper eyes and way lower tolerance than her sister – plus a judgment totally free of self-flattery – she wasn’t feeling them at all. sure, they were fine ladies when they were in the mood, able to drop witty banter and be super agreeable when they wanted, but overall, they were just too extra and full of themselves. they were kinda fine-looking, schooled at one of the original private academies in town, rolling with a twenty thousand pound fortune, constantly overspending and hanging with high-status peeps – so they legit had every right to be all high and mighty about themselves and, honestly, lowkey trash everyone else. they came from a straight-up respectable fam in the north of england, which was stamped on their memories way harder than the fact that their bucks came from trade.

mr. bingley snagged property worth nearly a hundred grand from his dad, who had planned to buy an estate but couldn’t stick around long enough to do it. mr. bingley had the same dreams, sometimes even picking his county like a boss; but now that he’s rockin’ a dope house and the full manor lifestyle, the homies who knew his super chilled vibe were lowkey wondering if he’d just spend the rest of his days vibing at netherfield, leaving the next gen to handle the buying.

his sis squad was mega hyped for him to score his own estate; but even though he was just a tenant at that point, miss bingley was totally down to preside over his table; and mrs. hurst, who married a dude all about style over cash, was just as willing to claim his crib as her own when it suited her. mr. bingley was barely even two when an unexpected rec led him to check out netherfield house. he scoped it out, peered into its main rooms for like half an hour, got mad impressions of the sitch and the key spaces – totally vibing with the owner’s hype – and snapped it up immediately.

between him and darcy, there was a rock-solid friendship, even though they were polar opposites. bingley was all about darcy’s chill, open, and flexible vibe, even if his own style was a total flip side; bolstered by darcy’s high regard, bingley had mad trust in him and high-key valued his opinions. when it came to smarts, darcy was on another level. the guy was both super cocky, reserved, and extra picky; and although his manners were proper af, they weren’t exactly welcoming. in that arena, his buddy had the upper hand. bingley was basically a magnet, getting love wherever he rolled up, while darcy was constantly stepping on toes.

the way they dished the tea on the meryton assembly was spot on. bingley swore he’d never met more chill peeps or hotter girls in his entire life – everyone was mad kind and attentive; it was all loose vibes, zero stiffness; he got to know the entire room in no time – and when it came to miss bennet, he couldn’t even imagine a more angelic presence. darcy, on the other hand, saw a bunch of peeps lacking both beauty and style – none of whom sparked the tiniest bit of interest or pleasure in him. he did admit miss bennet was pretty, but she, like, smiled way too damn much.

mrs. hurst and her sis were cool with that; they still mad respected her and were like, “she’s such a sweet girl,” and even said they wouldn’t be opposed to getting to know her better. so miss bennet got stamped as a total sweetheart, and their brother felt totally justified in thinking of her however he wanted.
