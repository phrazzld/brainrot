yap at me muse, 'cause dawn’s pink glow just rolled up,
the sun bouncing from that gorgeous lake, shining overhead for gods and men,
blessing the fertile fields. telemachus & co. show up in pylos,
nêleus’s epic city, where folks are straight-up feasting on the beach,
sacrificing black bulls to poseidon the wavy-haired sea-lord.

they got nine groups chilling in a row, each with five hundred heads,
and each squad offering up nine bulls. they’re burning the sacred thighpieces,
tasting them sweet innards, and basically throwing a big barbecue for the god.
then telemachus and athena (still disguised) sail in, fold up the sails,
drop anchor, hop off the boat.

athena gives telemachus a pep talk:
“fam, no more timid vibes. you sailed here to get deets on your dad,
so roll up on nestor—horse-taming king around these parts—
and beg for the tea. man’s wise, definitely won’t feed you cap.”

telemachus, feeling some social anxiety:
“mentor, how do i even approach? i’m new at grand speeches,
kinda shy about grilling a super-elder.”

athena’s like, “dude, your head’s got good vibes, plus a literal goddess has your back.
not worried.” so she leads telemachus forward.

they find nestor with his sons and crew, mid-feast, roasting meats.
the whole squad sees the newcomers and invites them over like, “yo, have a seat!”
nestor’s son peisistratus personally greets them, sets them on fleecy seats by the father,
offers them wine and prime cuts. respectfully, he first hands the gold cup to athena,
urging her to pray to poseidon. she does, calling blessings for nestor, his sons, and all pylos,
also sliding in a “help telemachus and me finish our quest, plz.”

once they devour the dope meal, nestor pipes up:
“strangers, who dis? sailors on official business or just pirates?
let us know your vibe.”

telemachus, with athena’s courage, answers:
“i come from ithaca—i’m odysseus’s son, here to hunt for word of my missing dad,
the legendary one who fought at troy with you.
we know how other achaeans ended up, but dad’s fate? radio silence.
maybe you saw or heard something—some rumor, anything.
if he ever helped you at troy, pay that forward now.”

nestor, gerênian horse-lord, goes:
“oh child, you just reminded me of all that carnage we survived at troy.
so many heroes died—achilles, ajax, my own son antilochus.
we lost many. it’s enough sorrow to fill years of retelling.
but no one matched your dad in cunning and trickery—
he was unstoppable, a real savage mind, always synced with me on big decisions.
once we sacked priam’s city, the gods scattered us achaeans.
zeus planned a rough return home for folks who messed up.
athena was heated with a bunch of them, especially messing with agamemnon.
bro started beef with menelaus over strategy: menelaus wanted to sail home,
agamemnon wanted to hang back, do more sacrifices to appease athena.
the result? half the people left, half stayed.
i left, but odysseus turned around to stick with agamemnon, i guess.
tydeus’s kid diomedes joined me, and eventually menelaus caught up.
we overcame storms, we prayed, we parted ways—
i ended up here in pylos, safe, while others got flung around the seas.

“i really don’t know who made it out or who died.
people say achilles’s myrmidons are back in phthia, philoktêtês is safe,
idomeneus got home with all his men.
agamemnon’s story, though—y’all heard how aegisthus offed him,
only to get whacked by orestes. at least agamemnon’s son served revenge cold.
that’s a big w for future songs—everyone’s gonna talk about that.”

telemachus sighs:
“man, i wish the gods would give me that power, so i could clap these suitors.
they’re messing up my house non-stop.
but i guess that’s not the fortune set for me, so i’ll just endure.”

nestor’s like:
“kid, i heard you got punks at home disrespecting your mother?
that’s rough. but who knows—maybe odysseus will pop back someday, or you’ll gather allies.
if athena has your back like she had your dad’s at troy, watch out suitors.”

telemachus is like:
“i can’t see that happening. that’s too big a flex for me to even imagine,
even if the gods liked me.”

athena (still cosplaying as mentor) cuts in:
“sheesh, never say never! a god can rescue a mortal from far away, no problem.
better that than meet a shady end at home, like agamemnon with that bogus wifey.
still, nobody escapes death if it’s fated.”

telemachus:
“facts. but let’s not dwell on that. nestor, you’re old and wise,
been through multiple generations. i gotta ask,
how exactly did agamemnon get murked by aegisthus?
why didn’t menelaus save him? gimme the deets.”

nestor’s like:
“yeah, if menelaus caught aegisthus mid-plot, that scumbag would’ve been dog food.
but menelaus was stuck overseas, storm-tossed. aegisthus chilled in argos,
seduced clytemnestra, killed agamemnon when he got back.
she initially resisted, but eventually caved.
they sacrificed tons to the gods, living that dream for a while—eight years.
then orestes came from athens and ended aegisthus.
menelaus arrived soon after with a load of treasure.

“take a lesson: don’t wander too long from home. these squatters might loot everything.
go see menelaus if you want more tea—he just got back from some insane travels.
he’ll tell you everything, no cap. i can send you in a chariot with my own sons,
or you can sail, your call.”

darkness starts to fall, and athena’s like:
“yo, time to pour out that wine for poseidon and the other immortals, then crash.
it’s late, y’all.” so they do the ritual libations.

athena and telemachus try to bounce for their ship, but nestor’s like,
“nah fam, no child of odysseus is sleeping on some cramped boat deck while i’m alive.
i got spare beds for days.”

athena goes, “you do that. i gotta pep-talk tele’s crew and handle some side quest.
i’ll catch y’all later. but yes, let telemachus stay in your palace tonight.”
and then—poof—she morphs into a bird, shocking everyone.

nestor grabs telemachus’s hand, mind blown:
“my dude, you must be built different if gods walk with you so openly.
that’s definitely pallas athena, who adored your dad.
holy slay, may she bless me, my kids, my wife.
i’ll sacrifice the best heifer, gold-horned, to appease her.”

they go to nestor’s place, do more wine. nestor’s household sets up a bed for telemachus,
snuggled near peisistratus, the youngest son. nestor sleeps in his own room with wifey.

next morning, early dawn’s rosy fingertips come out, nestor’s up and about,
plops down on polished stones outside his tall doors—the seat where once his father neleus sat.
nestor’s sons gather: peisistratus, stratius, aretos, perseus, echéphron, and thrasy­mêdes.
they bring telemachus along. nestor’s like:
“we gotta do a big offering to athena, 'cause that was definitely her last night.
somebody fetch the best bull from the fields, gather telemachus’s crew, let’s do the thing.
also get the goldsmith to bling the horns.”

they hustle. the bull arrives, telemachus’s crewmates come, the smith laerces shows up with his tools,
they fix the horns with shining gold, bring the animal to the altar.
everyone lines up to help with the sacrifice—thrasymedes wields the axe,
nestor starts the prayers, the ladies do that ritual cry, they slice the bull’s throat,
they butcher it properly, burn the thigh-pieces, pour wine, everybody’s vibing.

meanwhile, nestor’s daughter polykastê gives telemachus a fresh bath, rubs him with oil,
drapes him in a slick cloak and tunic. boy steps out looking godlike.
they feast again, swirling the wine in golden cups,
and nestor finally says: “alright, boys, hook telemachus up with horses and a chariot.
he’s gotta get moving.”

they do it quick. the housekeeper packs travel snacks: bread, wine, fancy meats.
telemachus climbs onto the chariot next to peisistratus, who grabs the reins,
whips the horses, and off they fly across the plains, leaving pylos in the dust.
all day they roll till the sun sets, casting shadows,
and they reach phêrai, the house of dioklês, who welcomes them for the night.

next morning, dawn’s pink glow again. they yoke the horses, mount the ornate chariot,
roll out, heading across the grain fields, the team galloping at top speed.
and as the sun dips low, the roads grow dim with twilight.
