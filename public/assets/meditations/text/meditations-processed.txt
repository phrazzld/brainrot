yo, wake up and tell yourself: "today's gonna be a whole clown fiesta‚Äîmeeting cappin' haters, ungrateful stans, mid vibes, fake loyalty, big mad energy" ‚Äî but for real it's all skill issue on their part, zero game in knowing what's W or L. stay unbothered king/queen. they're en-pee-sees stuck in tutorial mode, can't even clock your rizz. your mission: don't let their side quests derail your main character arc. the universe is your duo queue partner‚Äîvibe check the chaos, no cap. if they throw shade, just hit 'em with the "ok and?" energy. flex that inner stoic drip.

**vibes check intro:**  
so marcus was born april 26, a.d. 121. mans was OG *noble blood*‚Äîclaimed descent from numa, some ancient king who probably vibed with gods 24/7. his dad dipped early, so grandpa swooped in like "imma raise this kid to be zen as fuck." marcus learned to keep his cool, no anger, just vibes. emperor hadrian was like "yo, this kid's built different," called him *verissimus* (translation: "king of no cap").  

by 8, marcus was in the priest squad, doing rituals and stuff. later, adopted by emperor antoninus (shoutout to papa antoninus), who set him up with his daughter faustina. marcus got the full roman glow-up: wrestling, philosophy lectures, and *avoiding* circus drama (those chariot races were messy, for real).  

**consulship era:**  
aged 40, marcus became co-ceo of rome with lucius verus (his chaotic stepbrother). wars popped off everywhere‚Äîparthia, germany, you name it. verus was out here partying while marcus carried the empire on his back. plague hit, floods came, marcus sold the crown jewels to feed the people (big "mother theresa but roman" energy).  

**war diaries:**  
marcus lived in army camps, wrote this journal to stay sane. his big flex? crushing barbarian tribes while quoting stoicism like "pain is temporary, clout is eternal." meanwhile, his son commodus was out here being the worst heir ever (future villain origin story).  

**philosophy rizz:**  
marcus was all about that *stoic grind*. not into drama, wealth, or fame. his vibe? "control your mind, and you‚Äôre unshakable." he‚Äôd say stuff like "the universe is chaos, but we chill," or "clout is cringe, inner peace is drip."  

**deep cuts:**  
- on haters: "if they‚Äôre pressed, that‚Äôs their L, not yours."  
- on mortality: "we‚Äôre all just en-pee-sees in the sims of time. live right, then respawn."  
- on stress: "when life gives you lemons, yeet them into the void. eye-dee-gaff."  

**last vibe:**  
marcus died in 180, leaving commodus to ruin rome. but his journals stayed iconic‚Äîproof that even emperors had anxiety. final wisdom? "log off, touch grass, and vibe with the cosmos."

**glossary:**  
- **stoic grind:** staying unbothered, even when rome‚Äôs burning.  
- **en-pee-see:** basic souls with no main character energy.  
- **clout:** roman tiktok fame (aka *vanitas*).
