yap at me, muse, tell how laurentum’s turnus
flashed that war-signal from the tower, horns blaring big yikes,
and made latium’s squads go feral, mid-lords calling all troops
to stomp farmland into dust, while venulus slid to diomedes
like “help us, bestie, trojan ops just pulled up claiming fate.”

our boy aeneas (trojan goat), swirling in anxious meltdown,
all stuck in the twilight, can’t get comfy no matter the pillow.
finally he dozes by the river’s hush vibes, but father tiber—
that chill aqua spirit—drifts from poplar fronds, telling him “based,
this land’s your final nest, no cap. check that sow & her piglets,
thirty squealing white lumps. juno might be salty, so toss her a prayer,
then vibe with arcadians, evander’s day ones. they loathe latins,
so align squads. i’ll keep the water calm, just do your rituals, g.”

sun up, aeneas flips hype mode. he prays, boards two slick ships,
snags that mother pig, makes an offering, big talk to juno:
“pls no drama, queen.” father tiber flattens his watery folds
like a perfect spree, so the trojans ride, gliding day and night,
their glitter shields in wave reflection, shocking the nearby trees.

they reach evander’s hustle, pallanteum, lunchtime feast:
the og king and his son pallas praising hercules, that alpha chad
who once bodied the psycho cacus spitting fiery breath in a cave.
evander, stunned at aeneas’s trojan aura, big tears: “dang,
you give me flashbacks to anchises. let’s link, share the vibes.”

he seats the trojans at the deity dinner, the squad raises cups,
chanting how herc ended cacus’s cringe spree. old stone walls echo
the saga: big herc broke mountains, yanked boulders, forced light
into that demon’s lair. the locals still throw annual bashes to flex.

night cloaks them in hush. next morn evander explains:
“yo, the etruscans want to dethrone mezentius—king cringe.
they beg for a foreign commander. that’s you, trojan main.
i’ll toss my son pallas plus two hundred savage horsemen.
make him see real war, glizzy up his skill issue.” father in tears,
he clutches pallas, praying jupiter spares the kid from flops.

aeneas dips, bright signals from the heavens confirm the play:
venus is forging that lit gear courtesy of vulcan’s workshop.
when she pulls up, she gifts a flaming helmet, savage sword,
armor that’s bussin’ with unstoppable flex, plus a future-coded shield
vulcan hammered into cosmic storyline—rome’s big glow-up
in 4k: sabine drama, horatius at the bridge, geese saving the capitol,
actium’s clash with cleopatra ghosting the scene, augustan triumphs.
aeneas lifts that hardware onto his shoulder, heart hammered with fate:
this is the unstoppable drip, the unstoppable story—he seizes the day.
