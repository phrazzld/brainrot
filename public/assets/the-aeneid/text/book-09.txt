yap, oh muse, spin that savage sequel from the latian plains,
where juno, big salty, slides iris down from the clouds
to hype turnus: “my guy, you betta move NOW,
’cause aeneas just ghosted his own squad, traveling upcountry
to some bougie homie named evander. so go crash their camp, no cap.”

turnus, eyes lit with major bde, thanks the rainbow queen,
then scoops a palmful of water for that quick vow.
he calls up the squad, and the fields erupt
with fresh flexes of gold-stitched drip and warhorses.
through the dusty gloom, the trojans spot that cloud of clout,
barricade themselves behind walls, remembering aeneas’s “stay put” speech.

meanwhile, turnus rides out in front, total big man on campus,
tosses his spear and roars, “yo, who’s with me first to clap these trojans?”
the trojan hearts skip a beat: they can’t risk the open field,
they cling to ramparts, dreading the fatal ratio of numbers.
like a starving wolf circling a warm barn of lambs,
turnus prowls, thirsting to drag them out to no-man’s-land.

spotting the trojan fleet moored beside the banks,
he hollers: “burn them ships, y’all!” brandishing a lit pine brand.
the rutulian hype is real: they toss torches, pitch, all that.
then, from the cosmic cheat codes, mother cybele calls
and *bam*—the trojan ships transform into sea nymphs,
slipping free with a splash, an epic cameo from the gods.
the rutuli are shook, but turnus shrugs,
like “meh, they can’t run now, they got no boats.
we got the land on lock, so tomorrow we bag ’em for sure.”

night falls, guard fires flicker, latins dancing tipsy around them,
while trojans stand spooked on the walls, scanning the dark.
in that hush, nisus and euryalus—bffs with hearts on fire—
plot a stealth mission for glory (and maybe extra cred).
nisus is like, “fam, they all hammered, we can slip out,
warn aeneas or snag some major kills.” euryalus be like,
“bet, let me ride along—i’m not letting you hog the xp.”
they approach ascanius, who’s thirsting for a father figure’s return.
the kid’s eyes well up, blesses them, promises fat rewards,
begs them, “pull up with my dad, bring him home safe.”
they set off, cloaked in that hush, seeking unsuspecting prey.

like savage tigers, they scythe through sleeping latins:
bodies slump in drunken confusion, bright blood soaking blankets.
euryalus nabs a fancy belt, a shining helmet—
that last trophy becomes a major L, 'cause it glints in the moonlight,
giving them away to a patrol. they bolt into the thorny gloom,
but euryalus gets snagged by a bush and weighed by stolen loot,
caught by the enemy. nisus, feeling the burn of loyalty,
turns around, praying to the moon goddess,
hurls spears that snipe a couple latins in the dark.
volcens, their captain, sees euryalus pinned,
goes ham with the blade, and nisus, losing it,
leaps out screaming, “take me, i did it all!”
too late—euryalus falls, a wilting flower of a teen,
and nisus rams his sword through volcens but dies on top
of his bestie, both heroes undone by that midnight hustle.

morning hits. the latins discover the body count,
spot euryalus’s loot among their fallen,
then impale the heads of the two trojan besties on spears
to flex at the walls. heartbreak rips through the trojan camp,
especially euryalus’s mom, who wails from the ramparts,
mad grieving that her boy’s lying in some savage field,
never again to see her tears or wear the tunic she stitched with love.

but war doesn’t pause for sorrow: turnus orchestrates
a next-level assault, battering the gates with savage force.
the trojans heave logs and boulders from the ramparts,
slamming the rutuli below. among them stands turnus, unstoppable,
hurling spears, slicing trojan souls.
pandarus and bitias fling open a gate to lure the latins in,
but turnus leaps through like a raging beast caged among lambs,
and chaos roars within the walls.
pandarus tries to fight him off, but turnus cleaves his skull in half.
the trojans freak; some bolt; turnus rampages deeper,
’til an entire wave of trojan fighters surges,
pinning him to the river’s edge in a swirl of spears.
drenched in sweat, battered shield near splitting,
turnus sees no escape but a final leap into tiber’s swirling gold.
the river lifts him safe with gentle waves,
washing off the gore, sending him back to his cheering bros.

so the trojans hold out (barely) while the latins toss torches and steel,
and the fallen bffs lie at the war’s cruel edge.
doom-laden fates swirl overhead, waiting for aeneas’s next move,
as the curtain drops on book nine of this savage story.
