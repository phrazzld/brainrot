chapter xxxvii.

that was locked in. so then we dipped and hit up the rubbage-pile in the backyard, where they stash old kicks, ragged threads, bottle shards, busted tin junk, and all that random trash, and i scrounged around and found an ancient tin washpan. we patched up its holes as best we could to bake our pie in, hauled it down to the cellar, jacked it full of flour, and started on breakfast. i even found a couple shingle-nails that tom claimed would be dope for a prisoner to scratch his name and sorrows on dungeon walls, and i dropped one in aunt sally’s apron pocket that was chillin’ on a chair, and jammed the other right into the band of uncle silas’s hat on the bureau—‘cause we heard the kiddos saying their pa and ma were cruising to the runaway nay nay’s crib that morning. then we bounced to breakfast, and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas’s coat pocket. aunt sally wasn’t even there yet, so we had to kick it and wait a minute.

when she finally rolled in, she was all heated, red, and mad, barely able to wait for her blessing; then she started slinging coffee with one hand while smacking any kid in sight with her thimble using the other, and she goes:

“i’ve hunted high and i’ve hunted low, and this totally beats whatever your other shirt has become.”

my heart legit sank deep among my lungs, livers, and everything, and a hard piece of corn-crust slid down my throat afterwards, clashed with a cough, got blasted across the table, smacked one kid in the eye, and curled him up like a wiggly fishing worm—unleashing a scream the size of a war whoop. tom even turned a shade of blue around the gills, and it all became a major scene for like a quarter of a minute or so. i’d have flipped out for half price if anyone had bid on this drama. but lowkey, after that, we were all good again—it was the shock factor that froze us, ya know?

uncle silas goes:

“it’s super weird, i just can’t wrap my head around it. i know for real i took it off, because—”

“’cause you only got one on. listen up, man! i know you took it off, and i can tell better than your scrambled memory, ‘cause it was on the clothesline yesterday—I peeped it myself. but now it’s totally ghost, that’s the tea, and you gotta rock a red flannel one till i can carve out time to make a new one. and that’ll be the third i’ve dropped in two years. it just keeps you on edge having you live in shirts; and whatever you manage to do with ’em is way more than i can even decode. man, you’d think you’d learn to treat ’em with some respect at your age.”

“i know it, sally, and i swear i try my best. but it ain’t totally my fault, ‘cause, like, i don’t even see them or mess with them unless they’re on me; and i don’t think i’ve ever really lost one.”

“well, it ain’t your fault if you haven’t, silas; you’d have dropped it if you could, i guess. and it’s not just the shirt that’s missing, no cap. there’s a spoon gone—and that ain’t all. there were ten, and now there’s only nine. i reckon the calf snagged the shirt, but the calf never dipped for the spoon, that’s on lock.”

“yo, what else is missing, sally?”

“there’s six candles gone—that’s facts. the rats coulda totally jacked the candles, and i bet they did; i’m lowkey wondering why they don’t dip with the whole crib, since you’re always patching up their holes then leaving ‘em open; and if they weren’t total scrubbers, they’d practically sleep in your hair, silas—you’d never peep it; but you can’t pin the spoon on the rats, and that’s straight up.”

“alright, sally, i’m at fault, i own it; i’ve been slack, but i ain’t letting tomorrow slide by without blocking up those holes.”

“oh, no rush; next year is cool. matilda angelina araminta phelps!”

whack—comes the thimble, and the kid rips her claws out of the sugar bowl, no cap. just then, the nay nay woman struts onto the hall and goes:

“missus, there’s a sheet gone.”

“a sheet gone! like, for real!”

“i’ll patch those holes today,” says uncle silas, looking all sad-faced.

“oh, patch it up!—suppose the rats swiped the sheet? where’d it go, lize?”

“clah, honestly, i ain’t got a clue, miss sally. it was chillin’ on the clothesline yesterday, but now it’s straight-up ghosted—it ain’t there no more.”

“i reckon the world’s totally ending. i’ve never seen such chaos in all my days—a shirt, a sheet, a spoon, and six candles—”

“missus,” pipes up a young yellowish wench, “they’re missin’ a brass candlestick.”

“get outta here, you bitch, or imma smack you with a skillet!”

she was straight-up spitting mad. i started eyeing an escape, thinking i’d dip out to the woods until things calmed down. she kept raging, running her whole rebel act solo, while everyone else was chill AF; and finally, uncle silas, lookin’ kinda goofy, fished that spoon outta his pocket. she froze, mouth open and hands up; and i legit wished i was anywhere in jerusalem or somewhere far. but not long after, she goes:

“it’s exactly as i thought. so you had it stashed in your pocket the whole time; and like, you probably got all the other junk in there too. how’d it even get there?”

“i honestly don’t know, sally,” he says, sounding apologetic, “otherwise i’d spill. i was deep into my acts seventeen text before breakfast, and i guess i dropped it there absentmindedly, meant to put my testament in, and it has to be like that ‘cause my testament ain’t there; but i’ll go check—and if the testament’s still there, then i know i didn’t stash it, and that proves i set it down and grabbed the spoon, and—”

“oh, for real, give it a rest! scram now, with all your kit and junk; and don’t even come near me until i get my chill back.”

i’d have peeped that if she even whispered it, let alone shout it out; and i’d have bounced and obeyed if i was already ghost. as we cruised through the sitting room, the old dude picked up his hat, and a shingle-nail dropped on the floor. he just casually scooped it up, set it on the mantel, said nothing, and dipped out. tom caught that move, remembered the spoon, and goes:

“yo, sending stuff via him is dead—he ain’t reliable.”

then he adds, “but he did us a solid with that spoon, even if it was accidental, so we’re gonna hit him back stealth-style—patch up his rat-holes.”

down in the cellar, we had a crazy load of those, and it took us a whole hour, but we nailed the job—tight, on point, shipshape. then we heard footsteps upstairs, snuffed out our light, and dipped into hiding; and here comes the old man himself, clutching a candle in one hand and a bundle of random junk in the other, looking as scatterbrained as ever. he wandered around, first cruising to one rat-hole then another, until he’d scoped ‘em all. he then just stood there for like five minutes, scraping tallow-drip off his candle and deep in thought. finally, he slowly drifted toward the stairs, saying:

“well, for real, i can’t remember when i did it. i could prove i ain’t to blame ‘cause of the rats, but nevermind—let it slide. i figure it wouldn’t do any good anyway.”

so he kept mumbling upstairs, and then we dipped. he was a pretty solid old dude—always is.

tom was seriously stressed about scoring a spoon, but he insisted we needed it; so he cooked up a plan. once his hack was locked in, he filled me in on the blueprint; then we chilled by the spoon basket until we spotted aunt sally coming, and tom started counting the spoons and lining them up on the side, while i stealthily slid one up my sleeve. tom goes:

“yo, aunt sally, looks like there’s only nine spoons so far.”

she snaps:

“get on with your games and don’t bug me. i got this, i counted ’em myself.”

“i swear, i counted ’em twice, aunty, and all i’m seeing is nine.”

she was losing all patience, but of course she came over to count—anyone would. then she yells:

“i declare, there ain’t but nine!” she rants. “what the heck—damn these things, i’m counting ’em again.”

so i slipped back the one i’d stashed, and when she finished counting, she goes:

“dang this pesky trash, now there’s ten!” and she looked super huffy and bothered. but tom drops:

“yo, aunty, i don’t think it’s ten.”

“you dumbass, didn’t you see me count ’em?”

“i know, but—”

“alright, i’ll count ’em again.”

so i crammed one in, and they totaled nine again, just like before. she was literally losing it—trembling mad af. she kept counting till her brain was fried and even started counting in the basket instead of a spoon sometimes; so like, three times they came out right and three times way off. then she grabbed that basket, slammed it across the house, and knocked the cat to the other side; and she barked for everyone to clear out and leave her in peace, warning that if we bothered her again before dinner, she’d skin us raw. so we ended up with an extra odd spoon, which we jacked into her apron pocket while she was laying down our sailing orders, and jim got the scoop too—along with her shingle nail—all before noon. we were hella satisfied with the hustle, and tom admitted it was worth twice the hassle, ‘cause he said now she couldn’t ever count spoons the same way twice in a row to save her life; and she wouldn’t believe her own count even if it was legit—and that after she lost her mind counting for the next three days, she’d probably give up and even offer to off anyone who dared make her count them again.

so that night, we re-hung the sheet on the line, then jacked one out of her closet; and we kept swapping it back and jacking it again for a few days until she lost track of how many sheets she had, and honestly, she didn’t even care—she wasn’t about to lose her entire vibe over it, and wouldn’t count ‘em again to save her life; she’d rather ghost first.

so overall, we were solid on the shirt, the sheet, the spoon, and the candles—thanks to the calf, the rats, and our cray counting hustle; and as for the candlestick, no biggie, it was gonna blow over on its own eventually.

yo, that pie was a massive mission; we were hit with endless drama over that crust, no cap. so we squadrolled deep into the woods to fix that pie up and cooked it right there, and eventually we smashed it out, looking mad fire—but not in one day, fr. we had to drop three whole wash-pan loads of flour before we even got through, and we ended up toasted all over with our eyes practically smoked, all 'cause all we wanted was that crisp crust and we just couldn’t prop it up right—every time that bad boi would cave in. eventually, though, we had a glow-up moment and figured out the fix: just toss the ladder in the pie too, bruh. so on round two with jim, we went full hustle: we shredded the sheet into tiny strings, twisted 'em up, and way before dawn we had a lit rope that you could literally hang somebody with. and we hyped it up like, "nine months of grind, no cap."

then in the forenoon we hauled that rope back to the woods, but it just wasn’t vibe-ing with the pie. since it was crafted off a whole sheet, we had rope for, like, forty pies if we were flexin’ extra—and plenty extra for soup, sausage, or any munchies you crave. we legit could have thrown down a whole dinner feast.

but fr, we didn’t need all that extra rope. all we needed was just enough for our pie masterpiece, so we yeeted the surplus without a second thought. we didn’t cook any of the pies in the usual wash-pan—too shook that the solder might melt, bruh—but uncle silas had this baller brass warming-pan he prized hard, since it came down from one of his forebears with a long wooden handle who rolled over from england with william the conqueror on the mayflower or one of those OG ships, all stashed up in the garret with a ton of other vintage relic pots that were priceless not 'cause they made bank, but 'cause they were straight-up antiques, ya feel? so we snaked that bad boy out on the low and took it down there—she flopped on our first pie drops 'cause we were total noobs, but on the final run she came out smirking like a boss. we lined her up with dough, dropped her into the coals, loaded her up with rag rope, slapped on a dough roof, slammed the lid shut, tossed hot embers on top, and then chilled like five feet away, cool and comfy with that long handle—and in just fifteen minutes she popped out a pie that was a straight-up aesthetic flex. real talk, whoever munched that pie would probs need to snag a couple of kags of toothpicks 'cause if that rope ladder doesn’t harsh someone into business, i literally don’t know what i’m even spitting, and it’d hit 'em with enough stomach-ache to last 'til the next round.

nat didn’t even glance when we dropped the witch pie into jim’s pan; and we slid three tin plates at the bottom under the vittles so that jim had everything on fleek. as soon as he was on his own, he busted into the pie, stashed that rope ladder inside his straw tick, scribbled some marks on a tin plate, and yeeted it out the window-hole.
