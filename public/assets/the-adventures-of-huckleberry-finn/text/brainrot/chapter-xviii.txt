chapter xviii.

col. grangerford was a straight-up gentleman, fr. i mean, he oozed that classy vibe in every way, and his fam was totally on that high-tier aristocratic energy too. he was born proper – as the widow douglas always spilled – and no one ever denied that she was from the first aristocracy in our hood; and pap, he always hyped it up too, even though he wasn’t any hotter than a crusty mudcat. col. grangerford was hella tall and slim, rocking a dark, almost ghostly complexion – zero hints of red anywhere; he was clean-shaven every morning, keeping his thin face razor sharp, with the slimmest lips, nostrils so fine they looked like they were custom-made, a high-key nose, heavy brows, and eyes so black and deep they felt like they were peering out from ancient caverns. his forehead was mad high, his jet-black hair hung straight to his shoulders, and his long, skinny hands were always decked out in a fresh shirt and full linen suit from head to toe – so white it almost hurt your eyes. on sundays, he’d switch it up with a blue tail-coat sporting brass buttons that slapped. he rocked a mahogany cane with a silver tip like a total boss. there was zero extra fluff about him, and he never turned up loud. his kindness was so real you could literally feel it, giving off major confidence vibes. sometimes, when he smiled, it was a nice little moment; but when he straightened up like a liberty-pole and his brows started throwing off lightning vibes, man, you’d wanna dip to a tree and debrief later. he never had to tell anyone to mind their manners – everyone was on that chill, proper vibe when he was around. the whole crew loved having him – he was like eternal sunshine, making every day feel like perfect weather. but the minute he flipped into a storm cloud mode, it went so dark for like half a minute that nothing could go wrong for a whole week.

when he and the old lady rolled in the morning, the entire fam bounced out of their chairs to give them a huge good-day, only to sit down proper once they were seated. then tom and bob slid over to the sideboard where the decanter was, mixed up a glass of bitters, and handed it to him. he just held it, chillin’, until tom’s and bob’s drinks were sorted. then they all did a mini bow – minimal style – saying, “our duty to you, sir, and madam;” followed by a quick thank-you, and all three clinked glasses. bob and tom even drizzled a spoonful of water on the sugar and that slight hit of whisky or apple brandy at the bottom of their tumblers, then passed it over to me and buck so we could toast the oldies too.

bob was the og, with tom right on his tail – both were tall, handsome dudes with broad shoulders, brown faces, long jet-black hair, and dark eyes that were on point. they were draped head-to-toe in crisp white linen, just like the old gentleman, and rocked broad panama hats.

then there was miss charlotte; she was twenty-five, tall, proud, and majorly grand – top-tier chill when she wasn’t stirred up; but when she got heated, her look could totally stop you in your tracks, just like her dad. she was straight-up gorgeous.

her sister, miss sophia, was also a stunner, but with a different flavor – all soft and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.

each person had their own nay nay to serve them – buck included. my nay nay had a hella chill time ‘cause i wasn’t used to someone doing things for me, but buck’s server was always hyped and on the jump.

that was the whole fam lineup now, but back in the day there was way more – like three sons; they all got iced, and emmeline dipped too.

the old gentleman was flexing a load of farms and owned over a hundred nay nay. sometimes a whole squad of folks would roll up on horseback from like ten or fifteen miles away and crash for five or six days, throwing wild junket parties around the river, dancing and picnicking in the woods by day, and hitting up balls at the crib by night. these peeps were mostly fam – straight-up kin – and the dudes even brought their guns. it was a seriously baller crew, no cap.

y’all, there was another elite fam around – like five or six squads – mostly reppin the shepherdson name. they were equally high-key, well-born, rich, and grand, just like the grangerfords. both the shepherdsons and grangerfords shared the same steamboat landing, which was about two miles up from our crib; so sometimes when i rolled up there with our crew, i’d catch a bunch of shepherdsons riding their fancy horses.

one day, buck and i were out in the woods on a hunt when we heard some hooves – like, someone was riding up. we were crossing the road when buck goes, “quick! jump to the woods!” so we dipped and peeped through the leaves. soon enough, this snatched young dude came galloping down the road, riding like he was straight-up soldier mode, with his gun slung across his pommel. i recognized him – it was young harney shepherdson. i heard buck’s gun pop off near my ear, and harney’s hat flew off his head. he grabbed his gun and charged straight to our hideout, but bruh, we weren’t about that life – we bolted through the woods. the forest wasn’t thick, so i kept peeking back to dodge bullets, and twice i saw harney covering buck with his gun; then he bounced the same way he came – probably to snatch his hat, i guess, but i couldn’t peep it. we sprinted all the way home. then the old gentleman’s eyes started blazing for a minute – pure pleasure vibes, i swear – before his face chilled out, and he goes all gentle:

“i don’t vibe with shooting from behind a bush. why didn’t you step into the road, my boy?”

i was like, “the shepherdsons never do that, father. they’re all about flexin on the low.”

miss charlotte held her head up like a legit queen while buck recounted his epic story, her nostrils flare and eyes snapping on full blast. the two young dudes looked super serious but clammed up. miss sophia turned pale for a hot sec, then her color bounced back once she saw the man wasn’t hurt.

as soon as i could haul buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees, i pulled him aside and whispered, “did you wanna yeet him, buck?”

buck deadass admitted, “well, i bet i did.”

i pressed, “what did he even do to you?”

buck shrugged, “him? he never done did nothing to me.”

i asked, “then why you tryna kill him?”

buck replied, “bro, it’s all ‘cause of the feud.”

i was like, “what even is a feud?”

he shot back, “dude, where were you raised? you dunno what a feud is?”

i was like, “never heard of it – spill the tea.”

buck then hit me with, “a feud goes like this: one dude beefs with another and yeets him; then the other dude’s bro yeets the first one; then both sides’ bros jump in; then even the cousins chip in – and before you know it, everyone’s iced and the feud’s done. but real talk, it’s a slow burn and takes mad time.”

i asked, “has this one been lit for long, buck?”

buck replied, “for sure – like it started thirty years ago or something. there was some beef about something, then a lawsuit to settle it; the suit went against one dude, so he yeeted the winner – which, let’s be real, anyone would do.”

i prodded, “so what was the beef about? land?”

buck was like, “i reckon maybe – idk.”

i pushed, “so who did the shooting? was it a grangerford or a shepherdson?”

buck shrugged, “laws, how should i know? it was ages ago.”

i was like, “no one remembers?”

buck went, “oh, yeah, pa probably knows, along with some of the old heads; but now even they forgot what the whole row was originally about.”

i asked, “so, like, many iced people in this feud?”

buck replied, “oh, for real – mad funerals. but they don’t always kill. pa’s got a few buckshot dents in him; but he’s chill ‘cause he’s light af. bob’s been skewered with a bowie a bit, and tom’s gotten hurt once or twice.”

i asked, “anyone iced this year, buck?”

buck dropped, “yeah; we iced one and they iced one. like three months ago, my cousin bud – a fourteen-year-old – was riding through the woods on the other side of the river without any weapon, which was straight-up foolishness. in some lonely spot, he hears a horse coming up behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson chasing him with his gun, his white hair flapping in the wind; and instead of yeeting himself off and diving into the brush, bud bet he could out-ride him. so they went full drag race for five miles, with the old dude gradually gaining ground; finally, bud realized it was hopeless, stopped, and turned to face the bullet barrage – and then the old man rode up and iced him down. but bud didn’t even get to savor his luck, ‘cause less than a week later, our folks laid him out for good.”

i said, “i gotta say, that old man seemed like a coward, buck.”

buck fired back, “nah, he wasn’t a coward – not by a damn sight. there ain’t a single coward among them shepherdsons, not one. and same goes for the grangerfords. like, one time that old dude held off three grangerfords in a fight for half an hour and came out on top. they were all on horseback; he dismounted, took cover behind a woodpile, and used his horse as a shield. but the grangerfords just circled him, peppering him with shots, and he shot back hard. both he and his horse got wrecked, and the grangerfords had to be hauled home – with one iced and another dying the next day. no cap; if you’re hunting for cowards, don’t waste your time with shepherdsons ‘cause they don’t breed any of that weak stuff.”

next sunday, the whole squad hit church – about three miles away, everyone riding their horses. the dudes, buck included, rolled with their guns, keeping them between their knees or tucked against the wall, and the shepherdsons did the same. the preaching was mad ornery – all about brotherly love and the usual tiresome spiel – but everyone legit called it a solid sermon. afterwards, the crew went off chatting heavy about faith, good works, free grace, preforeordination, and a bunch of other deep stuff, making it one of the roughest, most intense sundays ever.

about an hour after dinner, everyone was straight-up dozing – some in their chairs, some in their rooms – and it got mad dull. buck and a dog were sprawled out on the grass, sun-soaked and asleep. i bounced to our room planning to catch some z’s myself, when i spotted that sweet miss sophia chillin’ at her door, right next to ours. she pulled me into her room, shut the door soft-like, and asked if i liked her – and i was like, “facts, i do.” then she asked if i’d do her a solid and keep it on the down-low, and i was like, “bet.” she said she’d forgotten her testament, left it on a seat at church between two other books, and wondered if i could ghost out there, scoop it up, and not spill any tea. i was all in. so i slid out and crept up the road, and the church was practically ghost town – maybe a hog or two wandering around, ‘cause there was no lock on the door, and apparently hogs love that cool puncheon floor in summer. like, most folks only hit up church when they gotta, but hogs are on a whole different vibe.

i thought to myself, “yo, something’s sus; it ain’t normal for a girl to be so wound up about a testament.” so i shook the book, and out dropped a tiny piece of paper with “half-past two” scribbled on it in pencil. i rifled through it but found nothing else – couldn’t decode any extra deets—so i popped it back in the book. when i got home and bolted upstairs, miss sophia was waiting at her door. she pulled me in, shut the door, and flipped through the testament until she spotted the paper; as soon as her eyes caught it, she lit up. before i could even process, she grabbed me in a tight squeeze, declaring i was the best boy in the whole world, and made me swear to keep it on the low. she got mad red in the face for a minute, and her eyes shined so bright it made her look hella pretty. i was hella astonished, but once i caught my breath, i asked her what the paper was all about. she asked if i had read it; i said nah, and she asked if i could read handwriting – i was like, “no, i only read coarse-hand.” then she explained the paper was nothing but a bookmark to hold her place, and that i could bounce and go play now.

i bounced down to the river, deep in thought about this crazy sitch, and pretty soon i peeped that my nay nay was trailing behind like a lowkey sidekick. once we dipped out of crib view, he did a quick look-around and then came sprinting like he was chasing the latest challenge, hollering:

"mars jawge, if you slide into de swamp, i’ll flex you a whole stash o’ water-moccasins."

i was like, "omg, that’s super sus; he dropped that same line just yesterday—no cap, nobody’s that obsessed with water-moccasins to be chasing them down for no reason. what’s his vibe, anyway?" so i go, "aight, lead the way."

i trailed him for like a half-mile, then he dipped into the swamp, wading ankle-deep for another half-mile like it was nothing. we rolled up to this tight little flat spot, dry and chock-full of trees, bushes, and vines, and he goes:

"yo, just scoot in a few steps, mars jawge; that’s exactly where they be. i peeped 'em before, and i don’t really vibe with seeing that mess again."

then my dude dipped out, slinking away until the trees clapped him out of sight. i snuck into the area and rolled up to a chill open patch—no cap, it was about as big as a bedroom and draped in vines—only to peep a dude catching z’s. and, by jings, it turned out to be my old jim!

i shook him awake, totally thinking he’d be hyped to see me again, but nope—it wasn’t a shocker at all. he nearly teared up from joy, but surprise? nah. he was like, he swam behind me that night and caught all my yells, yet stayed lowkey ‘cause he wasn’t tryna get scooped up and shipped back into that slavery nightmare. he goes:

"yo, i got tweaked a bit and couldn’t swim mad fast, so i fell way behind you toward de las’; when you landed, i figured i could slide up on land without having to yell, but then when i peeped that house, i started slowing down. i was too far to catch what they were saying—i was legit scared of de dogs; but once it all went quiet again, i knew you were at de crib, so i dipped into de woods to wait 'til day. early in de mawnin’, some er de nay nays rolled through, headin’ to de fields, scooped me up and showed me dis spot where de dogs can’t track me ‘cause of de water, and they hook me up with truckloads of grub every night, spillin’ de tea on how you’re gettin’ along."

"yo, why didn’t you hit up my jack to fetch me here sooner, jim?"

"well, it wasn’t worth botherin’ you, huck—i figured we could work somethin’ out—but we’re all gucci now. i was out there coppin’ pots, pans, and vittles when i got a chance, patchin’ up de raft on de nights when—"

"hold up, what raft, jim?"

"our ole raft."

"yo, you tellin’ me our old raft ain’t totally wrecked?"

"nah, she ain’t. she got ripped up real bad—one end was straight toast—but nothing major went down; just our traps got mostly lost. if we hadn’t been diving so deep and swimmin’ so far, and if de night hadn’t been extra pitch black and we weren’t such scaredy-cats, as de sayin’ goes, we’d have spotted de raft. but honestly, it’s prolly for de best we didn’t, ’cause now she’s all patched up almost like new and we scored a fresh stash of gear in place of what was lost."

"yo, so how’d you lock down de raft again, jim—did you actually scoop her up?"

"how was i supposed to catch her out in de woods? nah; some er de nay nays found her snagged on a log right here in de ben’, so they hid her in a crick among de willows while jawin’ about which one she belonged to de most. i rolled in and fixed de sitch by tellin’ ’em she don’t belong to none of ’em but to you and me; then i asked if they were tryna snag a young white gent’s propaty and stash it, and i scored ten cents each—i mean, they were hella down with it, wishin’ for more rafts to come along and make ’em rich again. de nay nays are mad solid with me, and whatever i need ’em to do, i don’t have to ask twice, honey. dat jack’s a dope nay nay, mad smart too."

"facts, he is. he never once spilled that you was chillin’ here; he just told me to roll by and that he’d show me a fat stack o’ water-moccasins. if any crazy stuff goes down, he ain’t gettin’ mixed up in it. he can say he never peeped us together, and that’d be 100% the truth."

i won’t roast the next day too much, so i’ll keep it short. i woke up around dawn, ready to flip back to sleep, when i peeped how dead quiet it was—like no one was stirring whatsoever. that ain’t the usual vibe. then i noticed buck had ghosted. so, curious as ever, i got up and slid downstairs—nobody in sight; everything was chill and as still as a mouse. same vibe outside too. i thought, what’s up with that? down by de wood-pile, i bumped into my jack, and he goes:

"what’s it all about?"

"yo, don’t you know, mars jawge?"

"nah, i don’t know."

"well, then—miss sophia’s dipped! she legit ran off in de night sometime—nobody’s got de deets on exactly when; she bounced to get hitched to dat young harney shepherdson, you know—at least that’s de hype. de fambly found out like half an hour ago—maybe a bit longer—and man, the rush was wild. de womenfolk started stirrin’ up de tea, and ole mars saul with his boys loaded up their heat and rode up de river road tryna grab dat young dude and off him before he could dip across de river with miss sophia. i reckon things are bout to get hella rough."

buck dipped without even wakin’ me up.

i figure he did! they weren’t tryna snag you in their mess. mars buck loaded up his piece and swore he was gonna haul a shepherdson home or bust. i bet there’s gonna be plenty out there, and you know he’ll nab one if he gets a chance.

i hit de river road as hard as i could, and soon enough, i started hearin’ gunshots in de distance. when i slid into view of de log store and wood-pile where de steamboat docks, i crept under de trees and brush until i found a solid spot, then scrambled up into the forks of a cottonwood way outta reach and started peepin’. there was a sketchy wood wall, about four feet high, a bit in front of de tree; i almost dipped behind it, but maybe it was luck that i didn’t.

there were like four or five dudes clownin’ around on their horses in an open spot before de log store, cussin’ and yellin’, tryna box in a couple of young peeps hangin’ behind de wood wall next to de steamboat dock; but they couldn’t even get close—every time one of ‘em popped up on de river side of de wood-pile, bam, he got shot at. de two boys were lowkey squattin’ back-to-back behind de pile, keepin’ eyes on both sides.

after a hot minute, de dudes stopped clownin’ and yellin’. they started ridin’ toward de store; then one of de boys popped up, lined up his shot over de wood wall, and took one dude outta his saddle. all de men jumped off their horses, snatched de hurt dude, and started haulin’ him to de store; and in that very minute, de two boys bolted. they made it halfway to de tree i was in before de dudes even noticed. then de dudes saw ‘em, hopped back on their horses, and started chasin’. they closed in quick, but it didn’t matter—the boys had such a sick head start; they hit de wood-pile in front of my tree and slid behind it, flippin’ de script on de dudes. one of de boys was buck, and de other was a slim dude about nineteen.

de dudes tore around for a bit and then rode off. as soon as they dipped outta sight, i hollered down to buck to give him de 411. at first, he was totally bamboozled hearin’ my voice comin’ from up in de tree—he was mad shook. he told me to stay woke and hit him up when de dudes pop back into view, sayin’ they were up to some next-level mischief and wouldn’t be gone long. i lowkey wished i could’ve bounced from that tree, but i stayed put. buck then started bawlin’ and gettin’ loud, swearin’ that he and his cousin joe (the other young dude) were gonna make up for dis day. he recounted how his dad and two bros got taken out, along with two or three of de enemy—apparently, de shepherdsons ambushed ‘em. buck said his fam should’ve stuck with their own crew—de shepherdsons were just too savage. i grilled him about what went down with young harney and miss sophia. he said they managed to dip across de river safely. i was hella relieved; but the way buck went off ‘cause he didn’t manage to off harney that day—he ended up shottin’ at him—i’ve never heard nothin’ like that before.

suddenly, bang! bang! bang!—three or four shots fired off as de dudes sneaked through de woods and came at us from behind, without their horses! both boys jumped into de river—gettin’ hurt in de process—and as they swam with de current, de dudes raced along de bank, shootin’ and hollerin’, "kill them, kill them!" it made me feel so gross i nearly dropped outta de tree. i ain’t even tryna spill every devious detail—it’d mess me up all over again. i seriously wished i never pulled up on shore that night to witness such madness. i know i’m never gonna shake those memories—they keep crashin’ in my dreams.

i hunkered up in de tree ‘til dusk, straight-up paranoid to come down. sometimes i could hear distant gunshots in de woods; and a couple times, i peeped small gangs of dudes ridin’ by de log store with their heat—so i figured de chaos was still poppin’ off. i was mad down and out; i decided i ain’t never goin’ near that house again, thinkin’ i was somehow on de hook. i figured that sketchy piece of paper meant miss sophia was supposed to meet harney around half-past two and then dip; and i felt like i should’ve hit up her pops about that paper and her sus behavior, so maybe he’d have locked her down and spared us dis whole mess.

once i finally dipped outta de tree, i snuck along de riverbank and found two bodies chillin’ at de water’s edge. i hustled ‘em ashore, covered up their faces, and bailed as fast as possible. i even shed a tear while coverin’ buck’s face, ‘cause honestly, he was hella solid to me.

it was pitch dark now. i avoided de house like the plague and bounced through de woods, headin’ for de swamp. since jim wasn’t on his island, i bolted toward de crick, hustlin’ through de willows, mad anxious to jump on board and dip from that cursed zone. but damn, de raft was ghost! i was straight shook—couldn’t catch my breath for a minute. then i let out a yell. outta nowhere, a voice not even twenty-five feet away says:

"good lan’! is dat you, honey? doan’ make no noise."

that was jim’s voice—ngl, nothing ever sounded as dope before. i slid along de bank and hopped aboard, and jim scooped me up in a big hug, overjoyed to see me. he goes:

"laws bless you, chile, i was straight convinced you was dead again. jack showed up; he reckoned you got shot ‘cause you didn’t bounce home, so i’d just started pushin’ de raft down toward de mouf er de crick, gettin’ it ready to dip as soon as jack rolls back with de news that you’re for real dead. lawsy, i’m mighty glad to git you back, honey."

i reply, "aight—that’s mad good; they won’t catch me, and they’ll think i’m dead and floated down de river—i’ve got a trick up my sleeve for that—so don’t waste any time, jim; just bounce for de big water as fast as you can."

i didn’t catch no chill until de raft was like two miles down, floatin’ in de heart of de mississippi. then we ditched our signal lantern, figurin’ we was free and safe again. i hadn’t munched since yesterday, so jim whipped out some corn-dodgers, buttermilk, pork, cabbage, and greens—no cap, nothing in de world beats a meal cooked right—and while i grabbed my supper, we chopped it up and had a chill sesh. i was super stoked to dip out of all de feud drama, and jim was buzzed to leave de swamp behind. we both agreed, no crib beats a raft—other spots just feel cramped and suffocatin’, but a raft makes you feel hella free and comfortable.
