chapter xxi.

it was past sun-up now, but we kept it movin’ and didn’t even dock. the king and the duke soon came off lookin’ hella rusty; but once they jumped overboard and took a chill swim, it totally refreshed their vibe.

after breakfast, the king plopped himself on the corner of the raft, kicked off his boots, rolled up his britches, and let his legs hang loose in the water for max comfort, lit his pipe, and started gettin’ his romeo and juliet by heart. once he nailed it, he and the duke started practicin’ it together.

the duke had to school him over and over on droppin’ every line—makin’ him sigh and slap his hand on his heart—until he finally said he’d got it down; “only,” he goes, “you gotta not holler out romeo like a mad bull—you gotta drop it soft and emo, so—r-o-o-meo! that’s the vibe; 'cause juliet is like a sweet, pure little girl, and she ain’t tryna bray like a jackass.”

next, they whipped out a couple of long swords the duke crafted out of oak slats and kicked off a mock swordfight—the duke even dubbed himself richard iii.—and their prancing antics on the raft were straight-up epic. but soon enough, the king tripped and took a spill overboard, and after that they chilled and dished about all kinds of wild adventures from back in the day along the river.

after dinner, the duke goes:
“yo, capet, we gotta level up this show real hard, so i guess imma add a lil’ extra to it. we need something fire for those encores anyway.”

“what’s onkores, bilgewater?”

the duke clued him in, then said:
“i’m gonna hit back with either the highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe; and you—hold up—oh, i got it—you can drop hamlet’s soliloquy.”

“hamlet’s which?”

“hamlet’s soliloquy, fam; the most legendary drop in shakespeare. ah, it’s sublime, sublime! always pulls in the crowd. i don’t have it in a book—i only got one volume—but i bet i can piece it together from memory. lemme just pace a minute and see if i can flex it back from the vaults.”

so he started pacing up and down, deep in thought and frowning hardcore every now and then; then he’d lift his eyebrows, slam his hand on his forehead, stagger back and let out a moan; then a big sigh, and eventually a tear would roll down. it was mad beautiful. before long, he totally nailed it. he told us, “pay attention, squad.” then he hit a majestic stance—one leg forward, arms stretched out, head tilted back like he was checkin’ the skies; and then he began ripping into his speech, gritting his teeth, howling and flexin’ his chest like he was untouchable. honestly, he smacked down any performance i’d ever peeped. this is the speech—I copped it on the fly while he was schoolin’ it to the king:

to be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin
that turns a long life into a total trash show;
for who would shoulder heavy side quests, until birnam wood storms through dunsinane,
if not for the pure terror of the after-sleep,
that straight-up wrecks our chill vibe,
nature’s unexpected second course,
and makes us wanna sling wild arrows at outrageous fortune
rather than jump into unknown hustles.
yo, that’s the moment that makes you pause:
knock duncan awake with your epic knockin’!
i wish you could;
‘cause who would handle the whips and savage burns of time,
the oppressor’s lowkey wrongs, the proud dude’s brutal clapbacks,
the slow-mo of the law, and the final reset that his pain might deliver?
in the dead of night, when graveyards flex in their usual gloomy black,
only ’cause that undiscovered country—where no traveler ever bounces back—
spreads toxic vibes all over the world,
and so the natural glow of our resolve, like that poor cat in the old adage,
gets totally overcast with stress.
and all the clouds that hover over our hood,
their vibes go totally off-course,
and lose any claim to action.
it’s a finish that’s high-key worth the hype.
but yo, chill, fair ophelia:
don’t go openin’ up your chunky, marble jaws.
get yourself to a nunnery—bounce!

well, the old dude was totally vibin’ with that speech, and before long he mastered it so he could drop it like a boss. it was like he was born for this; and when he got hyped, it was pure gold watchin’ him rip, tear, and go all in—a performance for the ages.

the first chance we snagged, the duke printed some show bills; and for two or three days as we floated along, the raft turned into the dopest stage ever, non-stop sword fights and rehearsals (as the duke called it).

one morning, as we cruised down arkansaw, we peeped a tiny one-horse town chillin’ in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, at the mouth of a creek squeezed tight like a tunnel by cypress trees, and everyone except jim grabbed the canoe and paddled down to scope out if that spot had any potential for our show.

we struck it hella lucky; there was a circus poppin’ off that afternoon, and the locals were already rollin’ in in all kinds of rickety wagons and on horses. the circus was gonna dip before night, so our show had mad potential.

the duke booked the courthouse, and we went around plasterin’ our flyers. they read like this:

then we went loafin’ around town. the shops and houses were all these old, creaky, dried-up wooden frames that never got a fresh coat; they sat like three or four feet above ground on stilts so they wouldn’t get swampy when the river went cray. the houses had tiny gardens, but they barely grew anything except jimpson weeds, sunflowers, piles of ash, old curled-up boots and shoes, bits of bottle, rags, and busted tin-ware. the fences were a mishmash of boards, nailed on at random times; leaning every which-way, with gates that typically had just one hinge—a leather one. some of the fences had been whitewashed back in clumbus’s day, and there were usually hogs roaming the gardens, with folks constantly shooing them out.

all the shops lined one street. they rocked white domestic awnings in front, and the locals hitched their horses to the awning posts. there were empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers chillin’ on them all day long, whittlin’ at them with their barlow knives; chompin’ on tobacco, gaping, yawning, and stretchin’—a seriously ornery bunch. they usually rocked yellow straw hats as wide as umbrellas, but never wore coats or waistcoats; they’d holler at each other with names like bill, buck, hank, joe, and andy, chattin’ all lazy and drawn-out, droppin’ a mad stack of cuss words. it was like there was one loafer loungin’ by every awning-post, always with his hands in his britches pockets—unless he pulled ‘em out to share a chaw of tobacco or scratch an itch. and all you’d hear from them was:

“gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, hank.”

“cain’t; i hain’t got but one chaw left. ask bill.”

maybe bill gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got none. some of these loafers never have a single cent or even a chaw of their own. they always borrow; they’re like, “i wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, jack, i jist passed the last chaw i had to ben thompson”—which is a straight-up lie nearly every time; it only fools a total stranger, but jack ain’t no stranger, so he fires back:

“you give him a chaw, did you? so did your sister’s cat’s grandmother. you pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me, lafe buckner, then i’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”

“well, i did pay you back some of it wunst.”

“yes, you did—’bout six chaws. you borry’d store tobacker and paid back nay nay-head.”

store tobacco is like a flat black plug, but these dudes mostly chow down on natural leaf all twisted up. when they borrow a chaw, they don’t normally slice it off with a knife—they just wedge the plug between their teeth, gnaw at it and tug with their hands until it splits in two; then sometimes the owner gets all mournful when it’s handed back and goes all sarcastic:

“here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”

all the streets and lanes were nothing but mud—mud as black as tar, about a foot deep in some spots and a couple of inches deep elsewhere. the hogs chilled and grunted everywhere. you’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs ambling along the street, just plopping right in the path so that folks had to swerve around her. she’d stretch out, shut her eyes, flick her ears while the pigs were milking her vibe, lookin’ as happy as if she was gettin’ paid. and before long, a loafer would holler, “yo! hey boy! get ‘em, tige!” and off would dash the sow, squealin’ madly, with a dog or two jamming by each ear and three or four dozen more comin’; then all the loafers would rise up, watch the chaos outta sight, laugh their heads off, and be mad grateful for the noise. then they’d chill again until a dog fight broke out. nothing could wake ‘em or hype ‘em like a dog fight—unless someone dripped turpentine on a stray dog and lit him up, or tied a tin pan to his tail and watched him run himself to death.

on the riverfront, some houses were literally leanin’ over the bank, all bowed and bent, like ready to tumble in any sec. the folks had already bounced from ‘em. one corner of some houses had caved in, leaving that bit hangin’ over dangerously. some people still stuck around, but it was mad risky, ‘cause sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in all at once. sometimes a whole belt of land a quarter of a mile deep starts snugglin’ in and caves in bit by bit until the whole thing drops into the river in one summer. a town like that’s gotta keep movin’ back, and back, and back, ‘cause the river’s always gnawin’ at it.

as noon rolled in that day, the streets got hella packed with wagons and horses, with more comin’ all the time. families lugged their dinners from the boondocks and munched ‘em in their wagons. there was serious whisky flowin’, and i peeped three fights. before long, someone belted out:

“here comes old boggs!—back from the sticks for his monthly booze run; here he comes, boys!”

all the loafers got hyped; i figured they were all too used to turnin’ old boggs into a party. one of ‘em said:

“wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. if he’d a-chawed up all the dudes he’s been a-gwyne to chow up over the last twenty years, he’d be a legit legend by now.”

another piped up, “i wisht old boggs’d threaten me, ’cuz then i’d know i ain’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”

boggs is comin’ in full throttle on his steed, whoopin’ and hollerin’ like he’s straight up channelin’ tribal vibes, and he drops this fire line:

“clear the lane, squad. i’m ridin’ the hype-path, and coffin prices are ‘bout to go sky-high.”

yo, he was mad wasted and swayin’ in his saddle; this dude was fifty-plus and his face was lit red like a busted filter. everyone in the street was hollerin’, crackin’ up, and throwin’ savage roasts at him, and he clapped back hard, promising to school ‘em one by one—but he wasn’t waitin’ around, ‘cause he rolled into town to off old colonel sherburn, with the motto, “meat first, then get spoon-fed the rest, no cap.”

he peeks me, rides up, and spits, “yo, where you comin’ from, kid? you ready to yeet?”

then he bounces off. i was shook, but some dude was like, “don’t sweat it—he’s always spittin’ this crazy stuff when he’s lit. he’s the chillest old goof in arkansas—never clapped anyone, sober or smashed.”

boggs rolls up by the dopest store in town, leans in low to peep under the awning, and bellows, “come out here, sherburn! step up and face the dude you straight-up played. you’re the one i’m chasin’, and i’m comin’ for you too—no cap!”

and so, he kept droppin’ every burn on sherburn his tongue could muster, with the whole street packed tight, listenin’ and crackin’ up. soon enough, this fly dude—lookin’ all proud and around fifty-five, the best dressed in town—steps out of the store, and the squad parts like it’s a viral filter just to let him through. he strolls over to boggs, all chill and deliberate, and goes:

“i’m over this drama, but i’ll stick it out till one o’clock. after one, listen up—if you throw any shade at me even once, you won’t get far. i’ll track you down, no cap.”

then he bounces back in. the crowd got hella quiet; not one peep or laugh left. boggs roars off, still spittin’ mad burn after burn at sherburn down the block; soon enough, he comes back and parks right in front of the store, still on a savage rant. a bunch of dudes crowded him, tryna get him to zip it, tellin’ him it’d be one o’clock in about fifteen minutes—time to dip, bro. but nah, he went off, cussin’ at full volume, flinging his hat in the mud and ridin’ right over it, then tearin’ down the block again with his gray hair flyin'. every single person who could catch him tried coaxing him off his ride so they could lock him up and sober him, but it was useless—up the street he tore again, unleashing another round of burns for sherburn. then, someone hollers, “go for his daughter! quick, go for his daughter; sometimes her word is the only one that lands with him. if anyone can shut him up, it’s her.”

so some dude takes off runnin’. i cruised down the street a bit and then parked myself. in like five or ten minutes, here comes boggs again—but not on his horse. he’s reelin’ across the street toward me, bare-headed, with two homies on either side clutchin’ his arms and hustlin’ him along. he’s quiet and lookin’ all uneasy; he ain’t hidin’ but is rushin’ along like he’s tryna outrun his own chaos. then someone shouts:

“boggs!”

i glance over and see that it’s colonel sherburn, standin’ dead still in the middle of the street with a pistol raised in his right hand—not aimmin’, just coolly pointin’ it skyward. the same sec, i peep a young girl sprintin’ over with two dudes in tow. boggs and his crew spin around to scope out who yelled, and when they see that piece, they dip to one side as the barrel lowers slow and steady—both barrels cocked right. boggs flings up his hands and goes, “o lord, don’t shoot!” bam! the first shot rings out, and he staggers back, clawin’ at thin air—bam! the second shot lands, and the dude goes sprawling to the ground, heavy and solid, arms flung out like he’s glitchin’. that young girl loses it, screamin’, rushin’ over and floppin’ herself on her dad, bawlin’ out, “oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!” the mob squeezes in, shovin’ and stretchin’ their necks to get a peek, with peeps inside yellin’, “back, back! give him space, give him space!”

colonel sherburn then casually tosses his piece to the ground, spins on his heel, and walks off like it’s all just a random flex.

they cart boggs off to a run-down drugstore, with the crowd still crushin’ around and the whole town followin’. i scrambled to snag the best spot by the window to get a prime view. they laid him on the floor, propped his head on one massive bible, and spread another one over his chest—but not before they ripped open his shirt, revealin’ exactly where that bullet hit. he drew in about a dozen long gasps, his chest heaving the bible skyward with each breath—and then he just went silent; he was done, dead. then they yanked his daughter away from him, screamin’ and cryin’, and whisked her off. she was around sixteen, sweet and gentle-looking, but mad pale and straight-up terrified.

real quick, the whole town showed up, wriggling and scramblin’, pushin’ and shovin’ to snag a look at the window, but those who had the prime spots wouldn’t budge, and peeps at the back kept goin’, “yo, you’ve peeped enough, fam; it ain’t right for you to hog the view—others deserve a shot too.”

there was mad chatter goin’ on, so i dipped out, thinkin’ trouble was on the horizon. the streets were packed and everyone was hyped. every witness of the shootout was spillin’ the deets, and a huge mob pressed in around each dude, stretchin’ their necks like it was a flex challenge to catch every angle. then this lanky dude, long-haired and rockin’ a giant white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and wieldin’ a crooked-handled cane, started markin’ the spots on the ground where boggs and sherburn had stood. the crew trailed him as he strolled, bobbin’ their heads like they were in sync, stoopin’ down and restin’ their hands on their thighs to watch him trace the spots with his cane; then he straightened up exactly where sherburn had been, hat brim draggin’ over his eyes, and boomed out, “boggs!” then he swung his cane down slow to eye-level and went, “bang!” staggin’ backwards, then “bang!” again, before finally slumping flat on his back. the onlookers were like, “bruh, he nailed it—exactly how it all went down.” then about a dozen peeps whipped out their bottles and started treatin’ him like the performance of the century.

soon enough, some homie dropped the idea that sherburn should be lynched. within minutes, the entire mob was shoutin’ it out, wild and yellin’, snatchin’ every clothesline they could find to hang him up proper.
