chapter xiv.

by and by, when we bounced up, we flipped over the loot that gang jacked off the wreck—boots, blankets, clothes, and a crazy mix of other gear, plus a mountain of books, a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. we had never been this loaded in our entire lives. the seegars were prime, no cap. we chilled all afternoon in the woods, chatting and me reading the books, just vibing good times. i spilled every wild detail about what went down inside the wreck and at the ferry-boat, saying these things were true adventures; but jim was like, "nah, i don’t need any more wild adventures." he said that when i went into the texas and he crawled back to the raft only to find it gone, he nearly peaced out—‘cause he figured it was all over for him; like if he didn’t get saved, he’d be drowned; and if he did, whoever rescued him would ship him back home for the reward, and then miss watson would straight-up send him south. and he was so right; like, he was always right. he had a mad level head, for a nay nay.

i dropped some serious knowledge on jim about kings, dukes, earls, and all that old-school royalty drip—how they were mad flashy in their drip and flexed fancy titles like "your majesty," "your grace," "your lordship" instead of just "mister"; and jim’s eyes totally popped, and he was all in. he goes, "i didn’t know there were that many of them. i ain’t heard of any besides old king sollermun, unless you count those kings kingin’ it up in huge packs. how much dough does a king pull in?"

"get?" i say, "no cap, they can snag like a thousand dollars a month if they feel like it; they can have unlimited cash—everything’s theirs."

"ain’t that wild? and what do they even do, huck?"

"they don’t do a damn thing! what are you even saying? they just straight-up chill all day."

"no; is that really so?"

"of course it is. they just kick it—unless there’s a war; then they go full send. other times they just lounge or go hawking, just hustlin’ and sh— oh snap, you hear that noise?"

we bounced out to check, but it was just the flutter of a steamboat’s wheel cruising down from the point; so we dipped back.

"yeah," i reply, "and sometimes when things are dull, they mess with the parliament—and if someone doesn’t toe the line, boom, heads get whacked. but mostly, they just hang around the harem."

"around the harem?"

"harem."

"what exactly is the harem?"

"it’s where he keeps his wifeys. you ain’t heard of the harem? solomon had one—like, he had a million wives or so."

"damn, that's right; i—I kinda forgot. a harem’s basically a bord'n-house, i reckon. most likely, they throw wild parties in the nursery, and i bet the wife drama is off the charts; that just cranks up the noise. still, they say sollermun was the wisest dude who ever lived. i ain’t buying that though. like, would a wise dude really wanna live in constant blim-blammin’ chaos? nah—he wouldn’t. a wise dude would build a car factory and then shut it down whenever he wanted to chill."

"but still, he was the wisest dude, right? 'cause the widow herself told me so."

"i don’t give a hoot what the widow said, man; that dude wasn’t exactly wise. he had some seriously wack, dad-fetched ways i’ve ever seen. you heard about that kid he was gonna chop in two?"

"yeah, the widow spilled all that tea."

"well, then! is that really the wildest notion ever? just peep it for a sec. that’s the stump—one of the women over here, and over there is the other; i’m sollermun; and this your dollar bill’s the kid. do you expect me to cruise around the neighbors, figure out which one your bill belongs to, and hand it over to the right one all safe and sound like any dude with guts would? nah; i’d just smash that bill in two, give half to you and the other half to the other woman. that’s how sollermun was gonna roll with the kid. now, lemme ask: what’s the point of half a bill? it can’t buy jack. and what’s the use of half a kid? i wouldn’t care for a million dollars even, let alone half a kid."

"but yo, jim, you totally missed the memo—no cap, you’re a thousand miles off."

"who? me? go on. don’t even start with your points. i swear i know sense when i see it; there’s zero sense in doing something like that. the beef wasn’t about half a kid—it was about a whole kid; and any dude who thinks he can square off a whole kid dispute with just half a kid doesn’t have the brains to step out in the rain. don’t even talk to me about sollermun, huck—I know him from behind already."

"but i'm telling you, you ain't catching my drift."

"forget the point! i swear, i know my shit. and listen, the real tea is even deeper—it’s in how sollermun was raised. take a dude who only has one or two kids; that man isn’t gonna waste them—he knows their real worth. but if a dude’s got, like, five million kids running around his crib, that’s a whole different flex. he’d chop a kid in two as quick as a cat, no cap. there’s plenty more. whether it’s over two or less, it’s no big deal to sollermun, dad bless him!"

i never saw such a nay nay. if he got a thought in his head once, there was no erasing it. he was the most hardcore on solomon of any nay nay i ever peeped. so i switched gears and started dropping tea about other kings—letting solomon slide. i dished about louis sixteenth, who got his head chopped off in france back in the day; and about his little boy the dolphin, who would’ve been king, but they locked him up in jail, and some say he kicked the bucket there.

"poor little dude."

"but some say he broke out, dipped, and came to america."

"that’s lit! but he’ll be mad lonely—there aren’t any kings here, right huck?"

"nah."

"then he can’t pull any moves. what’s he supposed to do?"

"well, i don’t know. some join the cops, and some end up teaching people how to speak french."

"why, huck, don’t the french peeps talk the same way we do?"

"nah, jim; you wouldn’t catch a single word—they’re on a whole diff wavelength."

"well, now, i'm shook! how come that even happens?"

"i don’t know; but facts are facts. i copped some of their jabber from a book. suppose some dude came up to you and started saying 'polly-voo-franzy'—what would you think?"

"i wouldn’t think much; i’d just give him a solid bust over the head—that is, if he weren’t white. i wouldn’t let any nay nay call me that."



“yo, real talk it ain't dissin' you at all; it's just straight up asking, 'you got that french drip, or what?'
so like, why can't he just drop it in our lingo, bro?
nah, he totally is spittin' it—that's just how a french dude vibes, no cap.
ngl, that's a mad ridiculous way of doing it, and i ain't tryna catch any more of that useless drama. there's zero sense in it.

yo, jim, check this: does a kitty chat like we do?
nah, a kitty ain't on our wavelength.
so like, does a cow do it?
nah, a cow ain't flexin' that either.
so does a kitty talk like a cow, or does a cow chat like a kitty?
nah, neither do—they each got their own vibe, tbh.
it's totally natural for them to drop different lingo, right?
course, no cap.
and ain't it cool that a kitty and a cow keep it different from us?
facts, for sure—straight up natural.
so then, why ain't it chill for a french dude to flex his own style? answer me that.

yo, huck, a kitty ain't a dude, right?
nah.
so, it def ain't smart for a kitty to talk like a man. is a cow a man—or like, is a cow a kitty?
nah, she's chillin' in her own lane.
so she ain't tryna mimic either way. now, is a french dude a proper man?
yeah, for sure.
damn, then why the heck doesn't he talk like one? holla back, bro!

ngl, i peeped it was pointless spilling extra tea—you really can't school a nay nay in an argument. so i dipped.
