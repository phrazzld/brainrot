chapter xi.

"come on in," the woman said, so i slid right in. she then added, "get comfy."

i did just that. she sized me up with her little shiny eyes and asked, "what’s your name, fam?"

"sarah williams," i replied.

"so, where you from? around these parts?"

"nah, i’m from hookerville—like seven miles downstream. i walked all the way here and i’m dead tired."

"bet you’re hungry too. i’ll hook you up with something."

"nah, i’m straight. i was so starving i had to stop at a farm two miles back; now i’m too full. that’s why i’m late. my mom’s sick and broke, and i’m here to see my uncle abner moore." she went on, "i’ve never been here before—do you know him?"

"nope, i’m still new here too. haven’t been in town for more than two weeks. it’s a trek to the upper end, so you should crash here tonight. take off your bonnet."

"no," i said, "i’ll rest a bit and then keep it movin’. i ain’t scared of the dark."

she insisted she wouldn’t let me bounce solo, but promised her husband would be back soon—like in an hour and a half—and she’d send him after me. then she started spillin’ about her hubby, her up-river squad, her down-river crew, how they used to live like royalty and then totally messed up by moving here instead of stayin’ chill—and on and on, until i started wondering if i made a huge mistake coming to her for the town scoop. eventually, she switched gears to talking about pap and that murder mess, and i settled in to let her spill all the tea. she rattled off the story of me and tom sawyer finding six grand (even though she only pocketed ten of it), all the drama about pap’s rough life and my own struggles, and finally she got down to the part about huck finn’s murder. i asked:

"who did it? we’ve heard mad chatter about what went down in hookerville, but nobody’s sure who offed huck finn."

"i reckon there’s a big chance folks here are dying to know. some even say old finn did it himself."

"no way—is that for real?"

"most everyone thought that at first. he almost got lynched, no cap. but before nightfall, they flipped the script and blamed it on a runaway nay nay named jim."

"why, he—"

i trailed off, realizing i’d better zip it. she kept going, totally unaware that i had frozen up:

"the nay nay bounced on the very night huck finn got offed. now there’s a reward on him—three hundred bucks—and a bounty on old finn too—two hundred. see, he rolled into town the morning after the murder, spilled the deets, then hopped on the ferry-boat chase and dipped right after. by night, they nearly lynched him, but he was already gone. the next day, they found out the nay nay was missing—nobody had seen him since about ten o’clock on the night of the murder. so they pinned it on him; and while everyone was jawin' about that, old finn came back the next day, bawling to judge thatcher for cash to fund a hunt for the nay nay all over illinois. the judge coughed up some dough, and that same night, old finn got hammered, partying past midnight with some seriously hard-looking dudes, and then bounced with them. he hasn’t been seen since, and they’re not chasing him until things cool down a bit, ‘cause now people think he offed his own boy and set things up so folks would figure robbers did it—allowing him to snag huck’s money without any messy lawsuits. word is, he wasn’t too squeaky-clean to do it. oh, he’s slick, i reckon. if he doesn’t pop back within a year, he’ll be golden. you can’t pin anything on him; soon enough, things will quiet down and he’ll waltz into huck’s cash like it’s nothing."

"yeah, i feel that. don’t see any solid proof either. has everyone finally stopped thinking the nay nay did it?"

"oh, no—loads still think so. but they’ll nab the nay nay pretty soon, and maybe scare him straight."

"so, are they on his tail yet?"

"look, you’re off the hook! does three hundred bucks just drop from the sky every day? some folks reckon the nay nay isn’t far from here. i’m one of ‘em—though i haven’t shouted it out loud. a few days back, i was chattin’ with an old couple next door in the log shanty, and they mentioned hardly anyone ever goes to that island they call jackson’s island. i asked, 'nobody lives there?' and they were like, 'nah, nobody.' i didn’t push it then, but later i did some thinkin’. i was pretty sure i spotted smoke over near the head of the island a day or two back, so i figured that nay nay’s probably hiding out there. anyway, it’s worth a peek. i haven’t seen any smoke lately, so maybe he dipped if it was him; but my husband’s headin’ over to check it out—with another dude in tow. he was up the river, but he just rolled back today, and i told him as soon as he got in like two hours ago."

i got so antsy i couldn’t sit still and had to fiddle with something—so i grabbed a needle off the table and tried threading it. my hands were shaking like crazy and i was messin’ it up big time. when the woman finally stopped yapping, i looked up and caught her giving me a curious little smile. i dropped the needle and thread, played it cool like i was interested—and honestly, i was—and said:

"three hundred bucks is a serious stack. i wish my mom could score that. is your husband headin’ out there tonight?"

"oh, yeah. he rolled uptown with the dude i mentioned, to snag a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. they’re headin’ out after midnight."

"couldn’t they scope it out better if they waited till daylight?"

yes. and couldn't that nay nay see better too? after midnight, he's prob gonna be out cold, so they can slide thru the woods and scope out his campfire even better in total dark mode, if he even got one.

i didn't even clock that.

the lady kept giving me these full-on curious looks, and i was hella uncomfortable. pretty soon she goes,
"what did you say your name was, honey?"

"m—mary williams."

for some reason, i don't recall saying "mary" before—feels like i said "sarah"; so i was kinda cornered and lowkey freaked that i might be mixin' it up. i was wishing the woman would spill some more tea; the longer she sat, the more off-vibe i felt. but then she goes:
"honey, i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in?"

"oh, yes'm, i did. sarah mary williams. sarah's my first name. some peeps call me sarah, some call me mary."

"oh, that's the way of it?"

"yes'm."

i was feeling a bit better then, but i was still dying to dip out. i still couldn't bring myself to look up.

alright, so the woman started dropping mad deets about how hard times were, how they were forced to live broke, and how the rats were running wild like they owned the whole place—and so on and so forth—then i chilled out again. she was dead right about the rats. every now and then, you'd peep one poking its nose outta some sketchy hole in the corner. she said she had to keep stuff on deck to chuck at 'em when she was solo, or else they wouldn’t leave her be. she whipped out a twisted bar of lead, bragging that she was usually a solid shot with it, but she had busted her arm a day or two ago and wasn’t sure if she could throw true now. still, she kept her eyes peeled, and straight up swung at a rat; but she missed hard and cried, "ouch!" because it hurt her arm mad bad. then she told me to try for the next one. i was lowkey itching to bounce before the old man showed up, but of course i kept quiet. i grabbed that lead, and when the very first rat popped its head up, i chucked it with full force—and if that rat had stayed put, dude would've ended up a mega sick rat. she said that was first-rate, and she figured i’d nab the next one too. she then went and grabbed another chunk of lead and a hank of yarn she needed my help with. i lifted my two hands, and she draped the yarn right over them then went on yapping about her and her husband’s biz. but then she paused to say:
"keep your eye on the rats. you better have that lead in your lap, handy."

so she heaved the lead chunk right into my lap at that moment, and i clamped my legs on it tight while she kept talking. that went on for only about a minute.

then she snatched the hank and stared me straight in the face, looking all pleasant, and said:
"come, now, what's your real name?"

"wh—what, mum?"

"what's your real name? is it bill, or tom, or bob?—or what is it?"

i reckon i was shakin' like mad, not knowin' what to do. but i go:
"please, don't poke fun at a broke girl like me, mum. if i'm in the way here, i'll—"

"no, you won't. sit down and chill right where you are. i ain't gonna hurt you, and i ain't gonna snitch on you, neither. you just spill your secret and trust me—i'll keep it on the down-low; and, what's more, i'll help you out. same goes for my old man if you need him. see, you're just a runaway apprentice, that's all. it ain't even a big deal. you've been treated hella bad, so you made the call to dip. bless you, child, i wouldn't snitch on you. now, tell me all about it, that's a good boy."

so i figured there was no point in playin' games anymore, and decided to come clean and lay it all out, as long as she stuck to her promise. then i spilled: my dad and mom were dead, and the law had me bound out to some crusty old farmer out in the sticks, like thirty miles back from the river, and he was treating me so damn rough i couldn't take it anymore; he dipped for a couple days, so i grabbed my chance, jacked some of his daughter’s old threads, and bounced. i spent three rough nights clockin' those thirty miles. i was out there travelin' at night, hidin' by day, sleepin', and the bag of bread and meat i hauled from home lasted me the whole trek—i mean, i had plenty. i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me, and that’s why i hit the road for this town of goshen.

"goshen, child? this ain't goshen. this is st. petersburg. goshen's ten miles further up the river. who told you this was goshen?"

"why, a man i met at daybreak this morning, just as i was about to dip into the woods for my regular sleep. he told me when the roads forked i gotta take the right hand, and five miles would drop me in goshen."

"he was wasted, i reckon. he straight up fed you wrong."

"well, he did act like he was wasted, but it don't even matter now. i gotta be on my grind. i'll hit goshen before daybreak."

"hold up a minute. i'll hook you up with a snack to eat. you might need it."

so she served me a snack, and then goes:
"yo, when a cow's chillin' on the ground, which end bounces up first? answer quick—don't overthink it. which end is it?"

"the hind end, mum."

"alright, then, a horse?"

"the forward end, mum."

"so which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"

"north side."

"if fifteen cows are munchin' on a hillside, how many of them are eatin' with their heads all pointed the same way?"

"all fifteen, mum."

"well, i guess you've been livin' in the country. i figured you were tryna pull a fast one on me again. what's your real name now?"

"george peters, mum."

"alright, now remember it, george. don't go forgetting and tell me it's elexander before you dip, and then bounce saying it's george elexander when i catch you. and don't go messin' with women in that old calico. you might be smooth with a girl, but you could totally fool dudes, maybe. bless you, child, when you're tryna thread a needle, don't hold the thread and drag the needle to it; keep the needle locked and jab the thread toward it—that's how a woman usually does it, but a man always goes the other way. and when you're chucking at a rat or whatever, get up on your tiptoes and raise your hand all awkward overhead so you miss the rat by six or seven feet. toss it stiff-armed from your shoulder, like there's a built-in pivot for it to spin on, like a girl; not from your wrist and elbow, with your arm flung out like a boy. and, yo, when a girl tries to scoop something up in her lap, she spreads her knees out; she don't slap 'em together like you did when you grabbed that lead. i knew you were a dude when you were threading that needle; and i set up the rest just to be sure. now bounce on over to your uncle, sarah mary williams george elexander peters, and if you get into any deep trouble, send word to mrs. judith loftus—yeah, that's me—and i'll do what i can to save your skin. stick to the river road all the way, and next time you hit the trails, pack some proper shoes and socks. the river road's rocky as hell, and your feet are gonna be wrecked when you get to goshen, i reckon."

i bounced up the bank about fifty yards, then flipped my route and ghosted back to where my canoe was, a good piece below that house. i jumped in and dipped out in a mad hurry. i paddled upstream enough to hit the head of the island, then cruised across. i ditched my sun bonnet, 'cause i wasn't tryna deal with blind mode then. when i was about mid-way, i heard the clock start striking; the sound was faint over the water but clear—eleven. when i hit the head of the island, i didn't even pause to blow off steam, even though i was hella winded; i smashed right into the timber where my old camp used to be and sparked up a fire on a high, dry spot.

then i hopped back in the canoe and powered out for our spot, like a mile and a half downstream, going full throttle. i landed, slogged through the woods, up the ridge, and into the cavern. there, jim was straight up asleep on the ground. i shook him awake and said,
"git up and hump yourself, jim! there ain't a minute to lose. they're after us!"

jim didn't ask a damn thing or say a word, but the way he hustled for the next half hour showed he was mad shook. by then, everything we had in the world was loaded on our raft, which was prepped to get shoved outta that willow cove where it had been hid. we doused the campfire in the cavern right away and didn't even flash a candle outside after that.

i dragged the canoe a bit from the shore to peep the scene; but if there was any boat around, i couldn't clock it, 'cause stars and shadows are weak for seeing. then we hopped off the raft and slithered down in the shade, past the base of the island dead still—without uttering a single word.
