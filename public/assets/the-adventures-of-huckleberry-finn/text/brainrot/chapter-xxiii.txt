chapter xxiii.

all day long, the duke and the king were grindin’, riggin’ up a stage, hangin’ a curtain, and settin’ up a row of candles for footlights; and that night, the place was jam-packed in no time. when the venue hit max capacity, the duke bailed on door duty, slid around back, and marched onto the stage, steppin’ up in front of the curtain to drop a quick speech hypin’ up the tragedy, claimin’ it was the most thrill-packed show ever. he went on braggin’ about the tragedy and edmund keen the elder, who was set to nail the lead role; and once he got everyone’s hype meter cranked to the max, he rolled up the curtain, and next thing, the king comes prancin’ out on all fours, stark naked—painted all over, with ring stripes and all kinds of colors, as lit as a rainbow. and—i’ll skip the rest of his crazy outfit; it was wild and absurd, but straight-up hilarious. the crowd was dyin’ laughin’; and when the king finished his capers and bounced off behind the scenes, they roared, clapped, and stormed the stage until he popped back out to do it all over again—and then made him repeat it. seriously, it would make even a cow crack up to see the wild shows that old fool pulled.

then the duke lets the curtain drop, bows to the crowd, and announces that the epic tragedy will play for only two more nights, ‘cause he’s got big london gigs lined up—seats already sold out at drury lane; then he bows again and adds, if he managed to please and school them, he’d be hella grateful if they spread the word and brought their crew next time.

then about twenty peeps shout, “what, is it over? is that all?”

the duke confirms, and right then, the place goes wild—everyone shouts “sold!” and rushes toward the stage and them tragedians. but then, a big, fly dude jumps up on a bench and shouts:

hold up, squad! yo, just a sec, my dudes. they hit pause and listened. "yo, we got totally been played—sold out hard, no cap. but we ain’t tryna be the town’s clown and have this mess haunt us 24/7. nah, what we really want is to dip on the low, ghost this whole show, hype it up, and flip the rest of the town! then we all ride the same drip. that sound lit?" (“facts, dawg! the judge is spittin' pure fire!” everybody chimes in.) "aight, then—zip it on any talk of a sell. bounce back home and tell everyone to come peep this epic tragedy."

next day, the whole town was buzzin' non-stop about how lit that show was. the house was packed again that night, and we flipped that crowd just the same. me, the king, and the duke rolled back to the raft, grubbed down a solid supper; and soon, about midnight, they had jim and me haul that ride out, let it cruise dead center down the river, scoop it up, and stash it like two miles below town.

the third night, the pad was hella crammed again—and no newbies this time, just the OG show veterans. i was posted by the duke at the door, peepin' that every dude sliding in had pockets bulgin' or some secret stash under his coat—and trust, it wasn’t no designer cologne drip. i caught whiffs of nasty egg vibes by the barrel and rotten cabbage, like major food fails; and if i know my dead-cat signs (and i totally do), there were like sixty-four peeps cruisin’ in. i dipped in for a hot sec, but it was way too extra for my vibe; i legit couldn’t hang. so when the spot maxed out, the duke slipped a quarter to some homie and told him to hold the door for a minute, then started creeping toward the stage exit. i bounced after him; but the moment we rounded the corner and hit pitch black, he goes:

"yo, hustle out of these cribs and then skid to the raft like the dickens is hot on your trail!"

i was on it, and so was he. we hit the raft simultaneously, and in less than two seconds we were gliding downstream, mad dark and chill, sliding into mid-river without a peep. i figured the poor king was about to get roasted by the crowd, but nah—pretty soon he crawled out from under the wigwam and goes:

"so, how’d our ride vibe this round, duke?"

and he hadn’t even hit up town at all.

we didn’t even flash a light until we were like ten miles below the village. then we sparked it up and grubbed down, while the king and the duke were straight up laughing their skulls off over how they had hustled the peeps. the duke drops:

"noobs, flatheads! i knew the first crib would keep it on the down low and let the rest of the town get lured in; and i was like, yo, they’re gonna flop for us on the third night, thinkin’ it’s their turn. well, now it’s their turn, and i’m hella curious how much cash they’ll snatch for it. i just wanna know how they’re flexin’ their chance. they could even turn it into a picnic if they wanted—they rolled in with mad provisions."

these wild misfits raked in four hundred sixty-five bucks over three nights. i’ve never peeped cash roll in by the wagon-load like that before. later, when everyone was out cold and snorin', jim goes:

"yo, huck, ain’t it wild how these kings be flexin' their drama?"

"nah," i reply, "it don’t hit different."

"why not, huck?"

"cuz it’s in their damn dna, man. i swear, they’re all cut from the same glitch fabric."

"but, huck, our kings are straight-up legendary troublemakers; that’s literally what they are—total rapscallions."

"exactly, bro; i’m sayin’ all kings are basically rapscallions, as far as i can peep."

"for real?"

"peep history once—you’ll see. look at henry the eight; next to him, a sunday-school supervisor is like basic training. and then check charles ii, louis xiv, louis xv, james ii, edward ii, richard iii, and, like, forty more; plus all those ancient saxon gangs that went around wreakin' havoc in the old days. yo, you should’ve seen henry the eight in his prime. dude was in full bloom—a straight-up blossom. he used to marry a new wife every damn day and then chop her head off the next morning, like it was no biggie. he’d be like, "yo, fetch nell gwynn," they’d drag her in; next morning, "off with her head!" and bam, done. then, "ring up jane shore," she rolls in, next morning, "off with her head!"—and they just chop it off. "buzz up fair rosamun." fair rosamun answers, next morning, "off with her head." and he made each one spill the tea every night; kept it up till he hoarded a thousand and one tales, then dumped them into a book he called "domesday book"—which, no cap, was a dope title that summed it all up. you might not vibe with kings, jim, but i got the full deets; and this old scam of ours is legit one of the cleanest i’ve ever clocked. look, henry was all about stirrin' up chaos in the country. how’d he do it? post fancy notices? throw a show for the masses? nah. outta nowhere, he chucked all the tea in boston harbor like trash, dropped a declaration of independence, and dared ‘em to come at him. that was his style—never givin' anyone a fair chance. dude even had beef with his pops, the duke of wellington. so, what’d he do? tell his old man to show up? nah—he dunked him in a barrel of mamsey like he was swipin’ a cat. if cash was chillin’ around, what’d he do? he snatched it up. if someone paid him for a gig and then ghosted on checkin’ his work—what’d he do? he always flipped the script. if he opened his mouth—yo, if he didn’t shut it down mad quick, he’d lose his rep every damn time. that’s the kind of wild card henry was; and if we’d had one of him instead of our lame kings, he’d have hoodwinked the town way harder than our crew ever did. not sayin’ our peeps are total weaklings ’cause they ain’t, when you break it down to the cold facts; but compared to that old beast, they’re straight-up basic. bottom line: kings are kings, and you gotta cut ’em some slack. take ’em all together—they’re one mad ornery bunch. it’s just how they were raised.

"but yo, this one actually reeks of that nation vibe, huck."

"nah, jim, they all got that signature stank; you can’t help a king’s whiff—history don’t drop the tea on that."

"now, the duke? he’s sorta chill in his own cheesy way."

"yeah, a duke’s got his own flavor. but lowkey, he ain’t all that different. this dude’s solidly average for a duke—when he’s wasted, no one could peep a difference between him and a king."

"well, anyways, i ain’t tryna deal with any more of that nonsense, huck. that’s all i can stan."

"i feel you, jim. but they’re stuck with us, and we gotta remember what they are and roll with it. sometimes, i lowkey dream of a country where kings don’t even exist."

what’s the point of spittin’ the tea about how these dudes ain’t legit kings and dukes? it wouldn’t change a damn thing; after all, you can’t even tell ’em apart from the real deal.

i crashed hard, and jim totally ghosted me when it was my turn—he always did that. when i finally woke at daybreak, there he was, hunched down with his head between his knees, straight up moaning and gettin’ all sentimental. i kept it low, ’cause i knew exactly what was up. he was missing his wifey and his kids way up yonder, feeling mad homesick—since he’d never left his crib before; and i swear, he cared for his crew as hard as white folks care for their own. it might seem kinda weird, but that’s the real tea. he’d go off that sad song at night, when he knew i was knocked out, yellin’, "po' little 'lizabeth! po' little johnny! it’s mad rough; i reckon i ain’t ever gonna peep you again, like, ever!" man, jim was one of the best nay nay there ever was.

but this time, i somehow got into a deep convo with him about his wifey and his mini-mes; and eventually he goes:

"yo, what got me feelin' so wrecked this time is that i heard some wild noise over on the bank—a crazy whack or slam, ya know—ever since i started treatin' my little 'lizabeth all extra. she was barely a year old when she got hit with that scarlet fever and went through a brutal spell; but she bounced back, and one day she was just chillin', and i was like:

"yo, she gonna do it."

she just stood there, straight up smilin' at me. it twisted my vibe; so i hollered, loud as hell,

"you not hearin' me?—she’s gonna do it!"

she just kept standing, still smilin’. i was pissed, bro! then i snapped, "i swear, i’m takin’ you for mine!" and with that, i smacked her right on the dome so hard it almost sent her flyin'. then i dipped into the other room for about ten minutes; when i bounced back, the door was still wide open, and there she was, sittin' right there, starin' down and mournerin', tears just drippin'. damn, i was mad! i was fixin’ to handle the situation, but then—a crazy gust slammed somethin' behind her, bam!—and the kid just froze, no movement whatsoever! my heart nearly skipped a beat; i was so messed up i couldn’t even process. i edged in, all trembly and slow, cracked the door open real gentle, and peeped in behind her, all soft and quiet, then—pow! i yelled as loud as i could. she didn’t even flinch! oh, huck, i busted out cryin', scooped her up in my arms, and was bawlin', "oh, my poor little one! lord above, forgive old jim, ’cause he’ll never forgive himself for this, as long as he’s breathin'!" man, she was straight-up dense and clueless—totally deef and dumb—and i’d been treatin' her like that!
