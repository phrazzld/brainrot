explanatory  

in this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the missouri nay nay dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect; the ordinary “pike county” dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.  

i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.

scene: the mississippi valley  
time: forty to fifty years ago  

chapter i.  

yo, so peep this: if you ain’t already lowkey read that adventures of tom sawyer joint, then you prolly know the vibe—but don’t even trip, ‘cause that book was dropped by mr. mark twain, and honestly, he kept it mostly 100. sure, he flexed a few extras here and there, but overall, the truth was on point. like, everyone’s been sus and told a fib every now and then—except for aunt polly, the widow, or maybe mary. aunt polly—yeah, tom’s aunt polly—and mary, plus the widow douglas, all star in that tale, which was almost all fact with just a bit of extra sauce.

now here’s where things go savage: tom and i stumbled on a massive cash drop—the robbers’ secret loot stashed in a dank cave—and boom, we were made. we snagged six thousand dollars each, all gold, no cap. the mound of coin was an epic flex. but then judge thatcher swooped in, flipped that paper into interest, and started dropping a dollar a day for each of us, all year round—enough green to leave anyone shook.

the widow douglas took me in like i was her own, promising to “civilize” me and all that, but living under her strict, proper regimen was a total vibe kill. so when i couldn’t handle the basic cringe any longer, i dipped out. i grabbed my ratty old rags and hopped back on my sugar-hogshead, feeling free and hella satisfied. then, outta nowhere, tom sawyer tracked me down, all hyped up about starting his own band of robbers—and he was like, “yo, join the squad if you’re willing to act all respectable back at the widow’s pad.” so, i slid right back in.

the widow went off, bawling over me like i was some lost little lamb, dropping a load of names on me, but never with true malice. she even copped me new clothes, and man, i was sweating buckets, feeling all cramped in that fancy setup. then, the same old routine kicked off: the widow rang a bell for supper and you had to show up, pronto. once you hit the dinner table, you weren’t allowed to just chomp down immediately; you had to wait for her to lower her head and grumble a bit about the food—even though, no lie, everything was cooked to perfection on its own. i guess when you mix a barrel of random odds and ends, the whole vibe magically levels up.

after supper, she busted out her book and started lecturing me about moses and the bulrushers, and i was amped to hear all about it—until, plot twist, she dropped that moses had been dead for ages. so, i was like, “k bye,” ‘cause dead peeps aren’t even on my radar.

not long after, i got this sudden urge to smoke and asked the widow if i could spark one up. she shut it down real quick, claiming it was a sketchy, dirty habit and that i needed to cut it out. classic, right? some folks get so extra about stuff they literally know zilch about. here she was, yammering on about moses—totally irrelevant now ‘cause he was done—and yet she had the nerve to diss my smoke sesh, even though she took snuff herself like it was cool.

then her sis, miss watson—a skinny, no-nonsense old maid rockin’ some goggles—rolled in to crash at her place. straight up, she started drilling me with a spelling-book lesson for about an hour until the widow finally let up. i was losing my mind. for the next hour, everything turned into a major snooze fest and i got all fidgety. miss watson kept chirping, “don’t put your feet up there, huckleberry;” then, “don’t scrunch up like that, huckleberry—sit up straight;” and soon enough, “don’t go all gap and stretch like that, huckleberry—act like you got some manners!” then she went on about this so-called bad place, and i half-joked that i’d be down to check it out. she flipped out, but i wasn’t trying to spark trouble—i just craved a change of scenery, no biggie. she clowned me for my words, swearing she’d never say them for the whole world because she was dead set on living strictly to earn her spot in the good place. i couldn’t see any perks in that lame plan, so i lowkey decided i wasn’t feeling it—but kept that on the DL ‘cause stirring the pot never helps.

while all that was going down, she kept on about the good place, saying that all you gotta do there is roam around with a harp and belt out tunes forever. i wasn’t vibing with that at all, but i said nothing. i even asked if she thought tom sawyer would be down for it, and she clapped back that there was zero chance. that was totally a win for me, ‘cause i was all about keeping tom in my crew.

miss watson kept pecking at me nonstop and it got old real quick. eventually, they hauled in the nay nays for prayers, and then everyone bounced to bed. i shuffled up to my room with a half-ass candle and set it on the table. i parked myself by the window, trying to cook up some cheerful thoughts, but nada—it was all dead vibes. i felt so mad lonesome, i legit wished i was already toast. the stars were blingin’, and the leaves out in the woods were whisperin’ in a super mournful jam; i could hear an owl off in the distance go “whoo-whoo” like it was mourning someone who checked out, plus a whippowill and a dog crying like they knew someone was about to dip for good. the wind was lowkey trying to drop secrets, but i couldn’t decode its drip, sending shivers all over. then, deep in the woods, i heard the kind of sound a ghost makes when it’s tryna spill its heart but can’t, so it’s doomed to roam every night in eternal grief. i got so down and shook with fear, i seriously wished for some company. next thing, a spider started creeping up my shoulder, and without thinking, i flicked it off—only for it to land in the candle flame and shrivel up like it got roasted. i didn’t need anyone tellin’ me that was a mega bad sign foreshadowing bad luck, so i got super scared and ended up shaking off all my clothes. i spun around three times, crossing my chest each round, and even tied a tiny lock of my hair with a thread to fend off witches. not gonna lie, i wasn’t feeling too confident about any of that—i’d heard it’s what you do when you lose a lucky horseshoe you found, instead of slapping it over your door, though no one ever confirmed it actually wards off bad juju after offing a spider.

i sat back down, still shakin’, and pulled out my pipe to snag a smoke—since the house was dead silent like a morgue, so the widow wouldn’t peep my move. after what felt like ages, i caught the town clock boom—boom—boom, dropping twelve solid licks; then everything went even quieter. soon, i heard a twig snap in the dark among the trees—something was stirring. i froze and tuned my ears in. i could barely catch a soft “me-yow! me-yow!” echoing from down below. that was dope, so i whispered back a tiny “me-yow! me-yow!” as softly as possible, then doused the light and scrambled out the window onto the shed. i slithered down to the ground and crawled among the trees, and sure enough, there was tom sawyer waiting for me.

chapter ii.  

we crept along a shadowy path through the trees, tiptoeing back toward the edge of the widow’s garden, ducking so no branch could hit our heads. as we passed by the kitchen, i tripped over a gnarly root and let out a huge oof that totally busted our stealth. instantly, we dropped low and froze like statues. miss watson’s big nay nay, named jim, was posted at the kitchen door—we could see him crystal clear ‘cause there was a bright light behind him. he stretched his neck out for like a minute, listening hard. then he go, “who dah?”

he kept listening, then started tiptoeing right between us—we were literally inches apart. for what felt like ages, not a peep came from any of us. i started itching at my ankle, but i kept it cool and didn’t scratch. next, my ear got all twitchy, and then my back, right between my shoulders—I felt like i was gonna die if i couldn’t scratch that mad itch. i’ve been through that cringe vibe plenty of times: when you’re with your crew, at a funeral, or tryna crash when sleep just ain’t coming, your body itches in like a thousand random spots. soon enough, jim broke the silence:

“say, who is you? whar is you? dog my cats ef i didn’ hear sumf’n. well, i know what i’s gwyne to do: i’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin.”

so, jim settled himself between me and tom. he leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs out until one of 'em nearly brushed against mine. then, my nose went into full itch mode, getting so intense i nearly teared up—but i held off from scratching. next, the itch spread inside and underneath. i legit had no idea how to stay still. this miserable itch marathon dragged on for like six or seven minutes—it felt way longer, i swear. i was itching in, like, eleven different spots, and i thought i couldn’t hold on another minute; still, i gritted my teeth and braced for it. just then, jim’s breathing got heavy, then he started snoring—and suddenly, i found myself chillin' again.

tom shot me a secret signal—a little mouth noise—and we slid away on our hands and knees like total ninjas. when we were about ten feet away, tom whispered a wild plan: he wanted to tie jim to a tree for kicks. i was like, “nah, bro,” ‘cause jim might wake up and ruin our whole stealth vibe. then tom mentioned he was low on candles and was gonna slip back into the kitchen to swipe some more. i tried to warn him that jim might wake up, but tom was all in for the risk. so, we crawled into the kitchen and snagged three candles, and tom even dropped five cents on the table as payment. after that, we dipped out, and i was sweating hard ‘cause i just needed to vanish—but tom was dead set on creeping back to jim’s spot, hands and knees style, to mess with him. i waited, and honestly, time dragged on in that eerie, lonesome silence.

as soon as tom came back, we slid along the path, skirting around the garden fence, and eventually hit the steep hilltop on the other side of the house. tom claimed he swiped jim’s hat right off his noggin and hung it on a branch directly over him. jim stirred a bit, but lowkey didn’t wake up. later on, jim confessed that the witches had bewitched him, put him in a wild trance, rode him all over the state, then dropped him under the trees again—and that he’d hung his hat on a limb as a marker. the next time jim told his epic tale, he ramped it up, saying they even rode him down to new orleans; and every time he recounted it, he added more wild details until he claimed they jacked him all over the globe, leaving him wrecked with saddle-boils on his back. jim was hella proud of his story, so extra that he barely noticed the other nay nays. nay nays would trek from miles around just to hear jim drop his legendary account, and he was looked up to like the ultimate nay nay icon in the hood. odd nay nays would stand with jaws agape, peeping him like he was straight-up miraculous. nay nays are always yapping ‘bout witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever someone started spilling those tea deets, jim would swoop in and go, “hm! what you know ’bout witches?” and that person would get shut down real quick. jim always rocked a five-cent piece on a string around his neck, claiming it was a charm the devil himself hooked him up with—saying it could cure anyone and even summon witches on command, though he never dropped the exact incantation. nay nays would come from all over just for a glimpse of that five-cent piece, but they wouldn’t even touch it ‘cause the devil’s vibe was still on it. jim ended up getting totally roasted as a servant, ‘cause he got so uppity after claiming to have seen the devil and been ridden by witches.

so when tom and i reached the edge of the hill, we peered down at the village and spotted three or four twinkling lights—probably sick folks or something—and above, the stars were sparkling mad bright; down by the village, the river stretched out a whole mile wide, all still and hella grand. we bounced down the hill and linked up with jo harper, ben rogers, and a couple more of the boys who were hiding in that old tanyard. then, we unhitched a skiff and rowed down the river for about two and a half miles, cruising to a massive scar on the hillside, before finally hitting shore.

we rolled up to a clutch of bushes, and tom made everybody swear on their lives to keep the secret before he revealed a gnarly hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. then, we lit our candles and crawled in on our hands and knees. we trekked about two hundred yards until the cave burst open. tom led the charge, poking around in the twisty passages before ducking under a wall where you wouldn’t even notice a secret opening. we crept along a narrow corridor and ended up in a dank, sweaty, cold room—our chill zone for the night. then tom announced:  

“alright, squad, we’re officially kickin’ off tom sawyer’s gang. everyone down for this has gotta take an oath and sign their name in blood.”

everybody was hype. tom whipped out a sheet of paper with the oath scribbled on it and read it out loud. the oath bound every boy to stick with the gang and never blab any secrets; and if anyone dissed another member, the order was to off that person and their entire fam—no food, no sleep—until a cross was hacked into their chest, the gang’s ultimate sign. no outsider could fake that mark without getting sued, and if they did it twice, they’d be done. and if any gang rat even breathed a word about the secrets, their throat would be sliced, their body torched, the ashes scattered, and their name wiped out in blood from the gang’s roster—cursed and forgotten forever.

everyone was like, “damn, that oath is legit,” and asked tom if he came up with it himself. he admitted, “some of it’s original, but most of the vibe’s borrowed from pirate-books and robber-books—every high-key gang had one like this.”

some folks even thought it’d be sick to off the families of any boys who spilled secrets. tom was all, “facts, that’s dope,” and jotted it down. then ben rogers dropped,  

“yo, here’s huck finn—dude ain’t got no fam; what you gonna do ‘bout him?”

tom clapped back, “well, ain’t he got a father?”

ben said, “yeah, he’s got a dad, but you’ll never track him down these days. he used to be smashed, chillin’ with the hogs in the tanyard, but he’s been ghost for like a year or more.”

they hashed it out, and they was gonna bench me, cuz they claimed every boy gotta have a fam or someone to off, otherwise it wouldn’t be a fair remix for the rest. like, no cap, nobody had a hot idea—the whole squad was straight-up stumped and froze like a lagging livestream. i was this close to bawlin’, but then i dropped a savage idea and was like, “yo, how bout we offer up miss watson? they can off her instead.” and literally everybody chimed in:

“oh, she’s a vibe. that’s totally cool. huck can roll with us.”

then they all jacked a pin in their fingers to drip some blood for the sign, and i flexed my mark on the paper like a straight-up boss.

“now,” said ben rogers, “what’s the hustle for this gang?”

“nah, it’s just robbery and murder,” tom replied, deadass.

“but who we gonna hit? houses, cattle, or—”

“stuff! swipin’ cattle and such ain’t robbery, it’s burglary,” tom sawyer jumped in. “we ain’t no burglars, that’s weak style. we’re highway outlaws. we pull up on stages and carts on the road, rockin’ masks, offing peeps, and snatching their watches and stacks.”

“do we always gotta off the peeps?”

“oh, for real. it’s best. some clout types might disagree, but most say offing ’em is the move—except for those you stash in the cave until they get ransomed.”

“ransomed? what even be that?”

“i dunno, but that’s what the books say. i peeped it in lit, so obviously that’s our play.”

“but how can we do it if we don’t know what’s up?”

“dude, we gotta do it anyway. don’t i tell you? it’s all written in the books. you tryna flip the script and mess it up?”

“i feel you, tom sawyer, but how in the nation are these dudes gonna be ransomed if we don’t even know the deets? that’s the tea i’m after. so, what’s your take?”

“i don’t know for sure, but maybe keepin’ ‘em until they’re ransomed means keepin’ ‘em locked till they’re dead.”

“now, that’s a straight-up flex. why didn’t you drop that earlier? we’ll keep ‘em till they’re ransomed to death; and trust me, they’ll be a major drama squad—eatin’ up everything and always tryna bust loose.”

“how you talk, ben rogers. how they gonna bust loose when there’s a guard posted like a wifi snitch, ready to pop ‘em if they even twitch?”

“a guard? okay, that’s cool. so someone’s gotta hold down a night shift with zero sleep just to watch ’em. honestly, that sounds bogus. why can’t someone just grab a club and do the ransom right when they show?”

“cause it ain’t in the books, bro—that’s why. now, ben rogers, you down to do it by the book or nah? that’s the play. don’t you think the book authors already got the 411 on the right move? you think you can school ‘em? nah, we’re just gonna keep it 100 and ransom ‘em the regular way.”

“alright, i’m cool with it; but i gotta say, it’s a dumb-ass move anyway. btw, do we off the women too?”

“ben rogers, if i was as clueless as you, i wouldn’t even ask. offing women? nah fam, the books never dropped that tea. you scoop ‘em up to the cave, be all polite af, and before long they’re crushing so hard they never wanna bounce.”

“yo, if that’s how you roll, i’m down—but i ain’t tryna invest too much in that. soon enough, the cave will be so jammed with women and dudes waitin’ to be ransomed, there won’t be any room for the outlaws. but hey, i ain’t got no more words.”

little tommy barnes was straight snoozing, and when they yanked him up he got shook, bawled, and was like, “i wanna dip back to my ma; i ain’t tryna be a robber no more.”

so the squad roasted him hard, callin’ him a cry-baby, which got him heated enough to promise he’d spill all the secrets. but tom slid him five cents to zip his lips, sayin’, “we’re gonna link up next week to roll out, heist someone, and off some peeps.”

ben rogers piped up, “i can only roll on sundays, so i’m tryna kick it off next sunday;” but the whole crew was like, “that’d be mad uncool on a sunday,” and that locked it down. they agreed to set up a day ASAP, then crowned tom sawyer as first captain and jo harper as second captain of the gang, and we bounced home.

i slid up the shed and snuck through my window just as day was peeping in. my fresh threads were all greasy and clayed up, and i was hella exhausted.

chapter iii.

so, i got straight roasted in the morning by old miss watson ‘cause my gear was a total mess; but the widow wasn’t savage—she just wiped off the grease and clay and looked all pity-mode, making me think, “aight, maybe i should try to behave for a bit.” then miss watson hauled me into the closet for a prayer sesh, but spoiler alert: it was a total flop. she kept preaching that if i prayed every day, i’d get whatever i wished for. but nah, it didn’t work. i tried—once i even scored a fish-line, but no hooks. like, a fish-line without hooks is whack. i gave hooking a go three or four times, and still, nada. eventually, i begged miss watson to pray for me, but she clapped back, calling me a fool. she never dropped the deets on why, and i was left straight-up confused.

one day, i chilled in the woods and went deep on the prayer hype. i was like, if people can score anything by prayin’, why ain’t deacon winn cashed back the money he lost on pork? why can’t the widow snag her silver snuffbox that got jacked? why can’t miss watson level up? nah, i told myself, there ain’t no juice in it. so i bounced over to the widow and spilled my thoughts, and she was like, “the only score you get from prayin’ is in spiritual gifts.” that was too extra for me, but she broke it down: i gotta come through for others, do everything for them, have their backs 24/7, and never flex on myself—even miss watson’s included, if you catch my drift.

i cruised out in the woods, mulling over it for a hot minute, but couldn’t peep any real profit for me—except maybe for the squad, so i decided to just let it slide. sometimes the widow would pull me aside and drop some providence talk that made my mouth water, but next day, miss watson would swoop in and smack it all down. i figured there were two types of providence—one that vibed with the widow, and one that missed big time with miss watson. after long thinkin’, i figured i’d ride with the widow’s vibe if someone wanted me, even if i couldn’t peep how that would upgrade my life, seeing as i was pretty clueless, low-key extra, and ornery as hell.

pap hadn’t been spotted for over a year, and honestly, that was peak coziness for me—i was so over his drama. he used to always wreck me when he was sober and in the mood to beat me down; so i’d bounce to the woods whenever he was around. then, low-key, word got around that he was found drowned in the river about twelve miles upstream, or so they said. everyone figured it was him—this drowned dude was his size, ragged as heck, and had this wild flow of long hair just like pap; but they couldn’t make out his mug ‘cause it was all waterlogged and blurry. they even said he was floatin’ on his back. so they scooped him up and buried him on the bank. but i wasn’t chill for long, ‘cause i had a brainwave: i knew darn well a drowned man floats face-down, not on his back. so i peeped that this wasn’t pap at all, but a woman rockin’ a dude’s fit. and that had me all kinds of uncomfortable. i figured the old man might bounce back eventually, though low-key, i wished he wouldn’t.

we played robber for like a month, then i bailed—and the whole crew dipped too. we never actually offed anyone; it was all just epic pretend play. we’d bolt out the woods, crashing down on hog-drivers and women in carts lugging garden loot to market, but we never actually snagged any cash. tom sawyer had the wildest nicknames—callin’ hogs “ingots” and turnips “julery”—and we’d retreat to our cave to powwow about our fake heists and how many peeps we “killed and marked.” but i just couldn’t peep any real profit in it. one time, tom sent a boy to blitz around town with a blazing stick he dubbed a “slogan” (our gang’s hype sign), then dropped secret intel from his spies that the next day a whole squad of spanish merchants and rich a-rabs was gonna camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded with di’monds, plus a guard of four hundred soldiers—so we’d ambush them, off the hook, and scoop the loot. he said we had to flex our swords and guns and be mad prepped. i mean, tom could never even hit a turnip-cart but insisted on having all the swords and guns polished, even though they were just lame lath and broomsticks—you could whack ‘em till you dropped, and they’d still be garbage. i wasn’t tryna believe we could take on a mob of spaniards and a-rabs, but i low-key was hyped to peep the camels and elephants, so i rolled up the next day, saturday, ready for the ambush; and when the word dropped, we scrambled outta the woods and blitzed down the hill. plot twist: there were no spaniards, no a-rabs, no camels, not even a trace of elephants. it was nothing but a sunday-school picnic—just a primer-class sesh. we went off, chasing the kiddos up the hollow; and all we ended up snagging were some doughnuts and jam, though ben rogers scored a rag doll and jo harper grabbed a hymn-book and a tract; until the teacher stormed in and made us drop everything and cut.

i didn’t peep any di’monds, so i clapped back to tom sawyer. he was like, “nah dude, there’s loads of ’em there, plus a-rabs, elephants, and all sorts of extras.” i asked, “then why can’t we spot ‘em?” and tom said, “if you weren’t so clueless and had read don quixote, you’d know—it’s all done by enchantment.” he went on, “there’s hundreds of soldiers, elephants, treasure, and more—but our enemies, aka magicians, turned the whole setup into an infant sunday-school hangout outta pure spite.” i was like, “aight, so our move is to go after the magicians?” and tom called me a numskull.

“why,” he declared, “can a magician summon a squad of genies that’d wreck you before you can say jack robinson? these genies are as tall as dank oaks and as wide as churches.”

“so,” i replied, “suppose we score some genies to help us—can’t we then demolish that other mob?”

“how you even gonna get them?” tom shot back.

“i dunno, how do they get ‘em?”

“bro, you just rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and boom—the genies tear in with thunder, lightning, smoke rollin’, and they execute whatever you say. they’d even yank a shot-tower right out by its roots and slam a sunday-school superintendent over the noggin, no cap.”

“who makes ‘em go wild like that?”

“it’s whoever rubs the lamp or ring—they’re locked to whoever does, and they gotta do whatever he says. if you tell ‘em to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds and fill it with chewing-gum, or snag an emperor’s daughter from china for you to marry, they gotta pull it off before sunrise. and get this—they even gotta waltz that palace around the country wherever you want, feel me?”

“well,” i mused, “sounds like they’re a bunch of flat-heads for not guarding that palace themselves instead of letting it get hustled away. and honestly, if i were one of them, i’d peep a dude in jericho before i dropped my hustle for a tin lamp rub.”

“how you talk, huck finn. you’d have to show up when the lamp’s rubbed, whether you’re down or not.”

“what, and i’m as tall as a tree and as bulky as a church? aight then; i’d roll in—but yo, i’d make that dude scale the highest tree in the country first.”

“shucks, it’s no use chattin’ with you, huck finn. you come off as a perfect saphead, clueless as ever.”

i mulled all that over for like two or three days, then decided to test it out. i snagged an old tin lamp and an iron ring, then ventured into the woods, rubbin’ like crazy till i sweated buckets, hyping up on buildin’ a palace and sellin’ the drip—but nada, no genies showed up. so i was like, “yo, this is just one of tom sawyer’s bogus tall tales.” he might’ve been all in on a-rabs and elephants, but me? i was on a whole other wavelength. it straight-up reeked of a sunday-school flex.

chapter iv.

so, three or four months rolled by and winter was legit in full effect. i'd been hittin’ school most days—i could spell, read, and write a bit, and even drop the multiplication table up to “six times seven is thirty-five” (ngl, i ain’t tryna flex math beyond that even if i lived forever). math just wasn’t my vibe.

at first, school was mad lame, but eventually i got to the point where i could tolerate it. whenever i was hella tired, i’d play hooky and then hide out the next day, which actually recharged my mood. the more i hit school, the easier it got to roll with it. i was also slowly catchin’ on to the widow’s ways, which weren’t as harsh on me no more. livin’ in a crib and crashin’ on a proper bed was a tight squeeze, but before the deep freeze hit, i’d sometimes dip out and sleep rough in the woods—that was a legit break. i still dug the old ways best, but i was low-key feelin’ the new lifestyle too. the widow was like, “you’re comin’ along slow but steady, and i’m super proud of you.” 

one morning at breakfast, i accidentally flipped the salt-cellar. i was about to toss some salt over my left shoulder to shake off bad luck, but miss watson swooped in and clapped me down, yellin’, “take your hands away, huckleberry; you’re always makin’ a hot mess!” the widow tried to slide some good vibes my way, but i knew that wasn’t enough to ward off the curse. so after breakfast, i bounced out feelin’ all jittery and anxious, wonderin’ where this bad luck was gonna hit next. there are ways to dodge some jinx, but this one wasn’t in the playbook—so i just trudged along low-spirited and on high alert.

i rolled down to the front garden and clambered over the stile in the high board fence. there was about an inch of fresh snow on the ground, and i spotted someone’s tracks. they came up from the quarry, hung around the stile for a minute, then trailed along the garden fence. it was hella weird they didn’t actually dip in, after chillin’ there so long. i couldn’t figure it out. i was about to follow ‘em, but first i stooped down to inspect the tracks. at first, nothing stood out—but then i noticed a cross carved into the left boot heel with huge nails, like some ritual to keep the devil away.

i bolted in a flash, sprintin’ down the hill while glancing over my shoulder, but saw no one. i made it to judge thatcher’s pad as quick as humanly possible. he was like:

“why, my boy, you’re all outta breath. did you come for your interest?”

“no, sir,” i shot back, “but is there some for me?”

“oh, yes—a half-yearly just dropped last night—over a hundred and fifty dollars. quite a fortune for you. you better let me roll it in with your six thousand, ‘cause if you keep it, you’ll just blow it.”

“no, sir,” i replied, “i don’t wanna spend it. i don’t want it at all—nor the six thousand, for real. i want you to take it; i wanna give it to you—the whole six thousand and everything.”

he looked totally shook, like he couldn’t even compute it, and asked, “why, what can you mean, my boy?”

i snapped, “don’t ask me no questions, please. you’re gonna take it—won’t you?”

he replied, “well, i’m puzzled. is something the matter?”

i clapped back, “just take it, and don’t ask nothin’—so i won’t have to spin any lies.”

after a beat of deep thought, he said, “oho-o! i think i get it. you wanna sell all your property to me—not just gift it. that’s the real deal.”

then he scribbled something on a paper, read it over, and declared, “there; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ that means i bought it off you and paid for it. here’s a dollar for you. now you sign it.”

so i signed, and bounced.

miss watson’s nay nay, jim, had a hairball as big as your fist—straight-up snatched from the fourth stomach of an ox—and he claimed it was magic, sayin’ there was a spirit inside that knew all the tea. so that night, i rolled up to him and dropped that pap was back in action, cuz i peeped his tracks in the snow. i needed the lowdown on what he was gonna do and if he was stickin’ around. jim pulled out his massive hairball, muttered something over it, then held it up and dropped it on the floor. it hit solid and barely rolled an inch. jim tried again a few times, and it acted the same. then he got down on his knees, pressed his ear to it like he was testing a new app, but nada—it wouldn’t spill a word. he said sometimes it don’t chat without some serious moolah. i told him i had this old slick counterfeit quarter that was totally janky—since the brass peeked through the silver, and it wouldn’t pass legit, even if the brass was hidden, ‘cause it was so greasy it always gave it away. (i kept mum about that dollar from the judge, obviously.) i said it was whack money, but maybe the hairball wouldn’t even notice the difference. jim took a good whiff, chomped it, and rubbed it like he was troubleshooting a glitch, then promised he’d tweak things so the hairball would think it was real. he planned to slice open a raw irish potato, shove the quarter in between, and keep it there all night; so by morning, no brass would be showin’, it wouldn’t be greasy, and anyone in town could swipe it in a minute—let alone the hairball. i mean, i remembered a potato pullin’ that trick before, but i’d straight-up forgotten.

jim slid the quarter under the hairball, then knelt and listened again. this time, he said the hairball was all good—that it’d drop my entire fortune if i let it. i was like, “bet, go on.” so the hairball finally dished out its secret through jim, and jim passed the deets along. he said:

“yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do. sometimes he spec he’ll go ’way, en den agin he spec he’ll stay. de bes’ way is to res’ easy en let de ole man take his own way. dey’s two angels hoverin’ roun’ ’bout him. one uv ’em is white en shiny, en t’other one is black. de white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. a body can’t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las’. but you is all right. you gwyne to have considable trouble in yo’ life, en considable joy. sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you’s gwyne to git well agin. dey’s two gals flyin’ ’bout you in yo’ life. one uv ’em’s light en t’other one is dark. one is rich en t’other is po’. you’s gwyne to marry de po’ one fust en de rich one by en by. you wants to keep ’way fum de water as much as you kin, en don’t run no resk, ’kase it’s down in de bills dat you’s gwyne to git hung.”

when i lit my candle and rolled up to my room that night, there sat pap, his own self!

chapter v.

i had slammed the door shut, fr. then i spun around and there he was, just vibing in my rearview like a ghost from old memes. i used to be low-key shook every time—dude used to tan me so hard it was like a sunburned screenshot. i figured i was hella scared again at first, but ngl, in like a minute my heart hit a vibe check and i realized i was straight-up mistaken—i mean, after that first jolt when my breath legit skipped a beat because he popped out so unexpected; but then, real quick, i was like, nah, not scared enough to even bother.

he was pushing fifty, and no cap, he looked it. his hair was long, tangled af, and greasy like a busted fryer, just hanging down while his eyes glowed behind that vine-like mess. it was all deep black—zero gray vibes; same with his wild, mixed-up whiskers. his face, where it showed, was bone-white—like not your average dude white but the kind that makes your skin do a revulsion meme, a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white that’s legit cringe. and his outfit? straight-up rags, no drip at all. he had one ankle chillin’ on his other knee, and the boot on that foot was busted so badly two toes were peeking out and doing their own clout chase. his hat was just sprawled on the floor—a worn-out black slouch cap with the top all caved in, like a failed lid drop.

i was just staring at him, and he was also sitting there, sizing me up from his chair that was tilted back ever so slightly. i dropped the candle like it was hot. i peeped that the window was ajar—so he obviously climbed in through the shed. he kept eyeballing me all over. pretty soon, he goes:

“starchy threads—facts. you think you’re a major big-bug, huh?”

“maybe i am, maybe i ain’t,” i shot back, no cap.

“don’t give me any lip, bruh,” he snaps. “you’ve been stacking on those extra frills since i dipped. i’m gonna drag you down a peg before i’m done with you. they say you’re educated now—read and write and all that noise. you think you’re better than your pops ‘cause he can’t even hit the books? i’m gonna wipe that swag off your profile. who even told you it was cool to mess with all that highfalutin foolishness, eh? who gave you permission?”

“the widow. she clued me in.”

“the widow, huh? and who told her she could shove her shovel into business that ain’t even hers?”

“nobody ever said shit to her.”

“alright then, imma school her on meddling. and listen up—you drop that school hustle, you feel me? i’ll teach folks to raise a boy so he can flex airs over his own pops and act like he’s all that. if i catch you clowning around at that school again, imma come at you. your mama couldn’t read or write, period, before she dipped—and none of the fam could even back in the day. i can’t stand this hype, and here you are blowing up like you’re the next gen influencer. i ain’t having it—so spit some words, let me hear you read.”

i grabbed a book and started spitting some lines about general washington and all the war drama. after like, half a minute of me reading, he straight-up smacked the book with his hand, sending it flying across the crib. he goes:

“facts. you got this, i had my doubts when you first flexed. now listen up—drop those extra frills. i won’t have it. i’m gonna smack you down, my smarty pants; and if i catch you hitting that school again, imma tan you proper. first off, you’re gonna get a dose of religion too. i ain’t ever seen a son like you.”

next, he snatches up this tiny blue-and-yellow pic of some cows and a kid and goes:

“what’s this?”

“it’s like a badge they hand me for nailing my lessons.”

he rips it up and goes:

“i’ll hook you up with something better—imma give you a cowhide.”

he then sits there mumbling and growling for a hot minute, and then he goes:

“ain’t you one sweet-scented dandy, though? a bed, fresh sheets, a mirror, and a dope carpet—while your own pops is out there crashing with the hogs in the tanyard. i ain’t ever seen a son like you. i bet i’ll strip away all these extra airs before i’m done with you. no cap, your flex is endless—they say you’re rich. huh? what’s the tea?”

“they lie—that’s facts.”

“listen here—watch your mouth when you talk to me; i’m already maxed out today—so don’t come with that sass. i’ve been in town two days straight and all anyone’s buzzing about is you bein’ rich. i even heard that drip down the river. that’s why i’m here. you slide me that cash by tomorrow—I want it.”

“i ain’t got no money.”

“that’s cap. judge thatcher’s stackin’ it. hand it over. i need it.”

“i told you, i ain’t got no money. ask judge thatcher; he’ll spill it.”

“aight. i’ll hit him up; and i’ll squeeze him for every penny, or find out why his pockets are so deep. so, how much you packin’ in your pocket? i’m talkin’ now.”

“i only got a dollar, and i was gonna keep it—”

“doesn’t matter what you want it for—just cough it up.”

he snatched that dollar and chomped it to check if it was legit, then announced he was bouncing downtown to grab some whisky; said he hadn’t sipped any booze all day. once he bounced out to the shed, he popped his head back in and started cussing me out for flexing those extra airs and trying to be all superior; and when i figured he dipped, he rolled back in to warn me: watch that school hustle, ‘cause if i don’t drop it, imma come at you and smack you hard.

the next day, pap was smashed and stormed over to judge thatcher’s, full-on bully mode, trying to strong-arm him into handing over the cash; but judge thatcher wasn’t having it, so pap swore he’d flex the law’s muscle to make him cave.

then the judge and the widow took it to court, trying to snatch me away and make one of them my guardian; but it was a fresh new judge who didn’t vibe with the old man, and he was like, courts ain’t supposed to mess with family bonds if they can help it—he’d rather not yank a kid from his pops. so judge thatcher and the widow had to bounce on that whole plan.

that totally lit the old man up. he vowed he’d cowhide me so hard i’d be black and blue if i didn’t hustle up some cash for him. i snagged three bucks from judge thatcher, and pap grabbed it, got super smashed, and went on a wild rampage—cursing, rampaging, and whooping folks all around town with a tin pan until nearly midnight—then they locked him up, and the next day he got court-bound again and was jailed for a week. but pap was all satisfied, declaring he was the boss of his son and would make sure i paid for it.

when pap got out, the new judge was like, i’m gonna mold you into a real man. so he hauled you back to his crib, dressed you up all clean and sharp, and had you chow down breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the fam—treating you like old pie, so to speak. and after supper, he got deep about temperance and all that life advice until pap busted out crying, admitting he’d been a fool wasting his life; but now he was ready to flip the script, become a man no one would diss, and prayed the judge would have his back without throwing shade. the judge was like, “hug all the feels for that,” so pap cried, and his wife cried along with him; pap then claimed he’d always been misunderstood, and the judge was like, “i feel you, man.” pap went on to say that what a real man craves is mad sympathy, and the judge agreed—so they both got tearful again. then, at bedtime, pap stood up, stretched out his hand, and proclaimed:

“check it out, my dudes and dudettes; grab my hand and shake it. this used to be a hog’s hand—messy and raw—but not anymore; it’s the hand of a man who’s rebooted his life and would die before sliding back to that old self. remember my words—don’t forget i dropped them. it’s a clean hand now; shake it up—don’t be scared.”

so they shook it around, one by one, crying it up. the judge’s wife even planted a kiss on his hand. then pap signed his pledge—dropped his mark. the judge declared it the holiest moment ever, something epic like that. next, they tucked pap into a gorgeous spare room, and later in the night he got mega thirsty, clambered onto the porch roof, slid down a stanchion like a daredevil, swapped his fresh new coat for a jug of forty-rod, climbed back up, and partied hard; and by daylight, he crawled out again, trashed as a fiddler, tumbled off the porch, busted his left arm in two spots, and ended up frozen to death when someone found him after sunrise. and whenever anyone tried to map out that spare room later, they had to take mad measurements just to navigate it.

the judge was low-key feeling the pain. he mumbled that maybe a shotgun could reform pap, but honestly, he had no other lit ideas.

chapter vi.

ngl, it didn’t take long for pap to be up and hustling again, and then he went for judge thatcher in court to snatch that cash, and he even came after me for not showing up at school. he caught me a couple times and thrashed me, but i still hit school like a rebel, dodging or outrunning him most of the time. i wasn’t really about school before, but now i did it just to spite pap. that whole trial was mad slow—like they were never gonna start it—so every now and then, i’d borrow two or three bucks from the judge on pap’s behalf, just so i wouldn’t get a savage cowhide session. every time pap got money, he got smashed; every time he got smashed, he raised absolute hell in town; and every time he raised hell, he ended up getting locked up. this was totally his jam.

pap started hanging around the widow’s spot way too much, so she finally snapped and warned him that if he didn’t bounce, she’d stir up serious trouble. of course, he flipped out and declared he’d show everyone who was really in charge of huck finn. one spring day, he scoped me out, caught me, and dragged me up the river in a rickety skiff for about three miles, crossing over to the illinois shore where it was mad woody and there were zero proper houses—just some old log hut in a spot where the trees were so thick you’d be lost without a gps.

he kept me chained up with him 24/7, never giving me a chance to dip. we crashed in that ancient cabin where he always locked the door and stashed the key under his head every night. he had this janky stolen gun, i swear, and we lived off fish and game—real survival flex. every once in a while, he locked me in and bounced to the store three miles away for the ferry, trading our catch for whisky, then came back, got hella smashed, partied hard, and beat me up. before long, the widow caught on to where i was, sent some dude to scoop me up; but pap, armed with his gun, straight-up drove him off. eventually, i got so used to it i actually started digging the woods—well, every bit except the constant cowhiding.

it was mad chill and lazy—just laying low all day, smoking and fishing, with zero homework or reading. after a couple months, my clothes turned into straight-up rags and grime, and i couldn’t even process how much i loved this life compared to the widow’s proper routine—wash up, eat off plates, comb your hair, stick to a strict sleep schedule, and grind on books while old miss watson pecked at you nonstop. i never wanted to go back to that crampy, civilized scene. i even stopped cussing 'cause the widow was on that, but then pap didn’t give a damn so my swear game was back on. honestly, life in the woods was pretty lit overall.

but then, pap got way too trigger-happy with his hick’ry, and i ended up covered in welts. he started locking me in more and started disappearing for long stretches—one time, he locked me in and dipped for three whole days. it was mad lonely; i even thought he’d drowned and that i’d be stuck there forever. i got scared, so i decided i had to hatch an escape plan. i had tried busting out of that cabin a hundred times, but there was zero exit. the windows were so tiny even a dog couldn’t squeeze through, the ladder (that chimbly) was way too narrow, and the door was built like fortress-level oak slabs. pap was smart about not leaving any knives or tools behind, so i scoured the whole dump daily. but this time, i finally spotted an old rusty wood-saw missing its handle, tucked between a rafter and the roof clapboards. i greased that bad boy up and got to work. there was also an ancient horse-blanket nailed against the logs behind the table to block the wind from snuffing out the candle. i slid under the table, hoisted the blanket up, and started sawing a chunk out of the big bottom log—big enough for me to squeeze through. it was a brutal grind, but i was nearly done when i heard pap’s gun echo in the woods. i scrapped any sign of my work, dropped the blanket, hid the saw, and pretty soon, pap crashed back in.

pap wasn’t in a good mood—so true to his savage self. he ranted that downtown was a total mess and everything was falling apart. his lawyer was all, “i’ll win that lawsuit and snag the cash if we ever start the trial,” but judge thatcher had all the moves to drag it out forever. pap kept going, saying they were planning another trial to yank me away and hand me over to the widow as guardian, and that it’d definitely go his way this round. that shook me, ‘cause i seriously didn’t want to go back to that cramped, proper life. then pap went into full cuss mode, dropping every swear word he could think of, then re-dropping them to be extra sure he didn’t miss anyone—even calling a bunch of random peeps “what’s-his-name” as he ranted on.

he declared he’d love to see the widow scoop me up. he warned that if anyone tried to mess with him, he knew a spot six or seven miles out where he could hide me so tight that they’d hunt me down until they were totally beat and still couldn’t find me. that got my heart racing for a sec, but i figured i wouldn’t hang around long enough for him to pull that stunt.

pap then made me haul his stash from the skiff. there was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, a slab of bacon, some ammo, a four-gallon jug of whisky, an old book, two newspapers to use as wadding, and even some tow. i lugged it all up and crashed on the bow of the skiff to catch my breath. i mulled it over and decided i’d bounce—with the gun and some fishing lines—into the woods when it was time to dip. my plan was to never stick around one spot, just to roam cross-country mostly at night, hunting and fishing to survive, and get so far away that neither pap nor the widow could ever track me down. i figured i’d saw my way out and escape that very night if pap got dumb enough to get smashed—and i was sure he would. i got so lost in planning my exit that i didn’t notice the time until pap hollered, asking if i was asleep or, like, drowned.

i hauled everything up to the cabin, and soon it got dark. while i was cooking supper, pap took a swig or two, got all warmed up, and started ripping into another rant. he had been smashed in town and was lying in the gutter all night—looked like a total wreck, covered in mud, almost like he was adam himself—but all muddy. whenever his liquor kicked in, he always went off on the govment, and this time he roared:

“call this a govment! just peep at it and see what’s up. here’s the law, all set to snatch a man’s own son away—a son he busted his butt raising with all the stress and cash and anxiety. like, just as that dude finally raised his kid so he was ready to grind and make something of him, the law pops up and grabs him. and they call that govment! that ain’t all, either. the law cozies up to that old judge thatcher to help keep me from what’s mine. here’s the tea: the law takes a dude worth six grand or more and shoves him into a dump of a cabin like this, making him wander around in threads unfit for even a hog. they call that govment! a man can’t even claim his rights in a setup like this. sometimes, i seriously think about bouncing from the country for good. yeah, and i told that straight to old thatcher—right to his face. a bunch of folks heard me, and they know exactly what i said: for two cents, i’d peace out and never come near this cursed land again. i mean, check my hat—if you can even call it a hat—its lid pops up while the rest hangs below my chin, making it look like my head got jammed through a busted stove-pipe. peep it—i said, that’s one wicked hat for me to rock, enough to make me one of the richest dudes in town if i could just claim my rights.”

“oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. look here—there was a free nay nay from ohio, a mulatter, as white as a white man could be. he rocked the whitest shirt you ever did see and the shiniest hat; not a single dude in that town had clothes as fly as his. plus, he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the dopest old gray-headed nabob in the state. and get this, they said he was a p’fessor at a college, could spit in a million languages, and knew everything. and that ain’t even the worst part. they said he could vote from his crib. that got me hyped—i was like, what’s this country even become? it was election day, and i was about to roll up to vote, if i wasn’t too smashed; but when they told me there was a state where they’d let that nay nay vote, i bailed. i said, i’ll never vote again—those are the exact words i dropped, and everyone heard. and let me tell you, the country can rot—i’m never voting as long as i’m breathing. and check the slick-ass way that nay nay carried himself—he wouldn’t even give way if i hadn’t shoved him aside. i asked the people, why ain’t this nay nay put up at auction and sold? that’s what i wanna know. and what do you think they replied? they were like, “dude, he can’t be sold till he’s been in the state six months,” and he hadn’t even been there that long. boom—that’s a whole vibe. they call that a govment that can’t sell a free nay nay till he’s been in the state six months. here’s a govment that calls itself a govment, acts like one, thinks it is one, but still has to pause for six whole months before it can snatch a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nay nay, and—”

pap kept going on so hard in his drunk rant that he didn’t even notice his old wobbly legs taking him places. he tripped head over heels on a tub of salt pork and smashed his shins, and the rest of his speech was just a barrage of savage burns—mostly aimed at the nay nay and the govment, though he dissed the tub a bit here and there too. he hopped around the cabin like a busted pogo, first on one leg then the other, clutching one shin and then the other, and finally, outta nowhere, slammed his left foot for a rattling kick on the tub. but low-key, that wasn’t smart, ‘cause that boot was already leaking a couple of his toes out the front; so he let out a howl that made everyone’s hair stand on end, then tumbled down in the dirt, rolled around while clutching his hurt toes, and his avalanche of cussing that followed totally topped every rant he’d dropped before. he later said that was on par with what old sowberry hagan used to do in his prime—but ngl, i think he was just piling it on extra hard.

after supper, pap grabbed the jug like a boss and was all, “yo, i got mad whisky in here – enough to sauce two full-on drunks and one wild delirium tremens, no cap.” that was his forever flex. i was lowkey bettin’ he’d be so lit in like an hour that he’d be blind drunk, and then i’d swipe the key or peaced out, whichever was easiest. he kept guzzlin’ and guzzlin’, and eventually bonked out on his blankets; but luck wasn’t on my side, fr. pap didn’t hit that deep sleep mode – he was twitchy and anxious, moanin’ and floppin’ around like a glitchy livestream for a hot minute. eventually, i got so sleep-deprived i couldn’t even vibe with open eyes, and next thing i know, i’m straight up crashed and the candle was still burnin’.

i dunno how long i was out like that, but then – bam – an insane scream shattered the silence and i jolt up. pap was straight-up trippin’, hyper and hoppin’ around like he’d been hit with too many lag spikes, yellin’ about snakes, no cap. he kept sayin’ they were creepin’ up his legs; then outta nowhere he’d lurch and shriek like someone had just bit his cheek – but i couldn’t peep any snakes anywhere. he went off, sprintin’ circles around the cabin hollerin’, “yo, get him off! get him off! he’s gnawin’ on my neck!” i’ve never peeped a dude look so cray in his eyes. before long, he was totally wiped, collapsed, pantin’ his life away; then he started rolly-rolling on the floor, kickin’ stuff and flailin’ his arms at thin air, screamin’ that demons were on his tail. eventually, he burned out and chilled for a minute, moanin’ low-key. then he chilled even harder, not makin’ a peep. i could hear owls and wolves howlin’ in the woods – the vibe was straight-up spooky. he was sprawled out by the corner. after a bit, he jerked up a bit and tilted his head to one side like he was tryna catch a secret drop in the wind. he whispered, super low:

“tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re comin’ for me; but i ain’t goin’. oh, they’re here! don’t even touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re ice-cold; let go. oh, let a poor devil be, aight?”

then, get this, he dropped to all fours and started crawlin’ off, beggin’ like mad for them to leave him alone, then curled himself up in his blanket and went full drama under the old pine table, still beggin’ non-stop; eventually, he broke down and cried – i could even hear him cryin’ through the blanket.

not long after, he rolled out and sprang to his feet all cray, spotted me, and went full hunter mode. he chased me around like i was his next raid target, clutchin’ a clasp-knife and callin’ me the angel of death, swearin’ he was gonna off me so i couldn’t come after him no more. i pleaded, told him i was just huck, nothing more; but he let out this super screechy laugh, roared and dropped a bunch of salty curses, and kept sprintin’ after me. at one point, when i ducked and slid under his arm, he lunged and clutched my jacket between my shoulders – i legit thought it was game over; but i busted out of that jacket faster than a glitch in a speedrun, savin’ my skin. soon enough, pap was so tuckered out he slumped against the door, sayin’ he’d chill for a minute then off me. he jammed his knife under himself, declared he’d sleep to reload his strength, and then see who was boss.

so, he dozed off in a snap. meanwhile, i snagged that cracked-ass old chair and crept up as quiet as an offline stream, grabbed the gun, and slid the ramrod down to check – yup, it was loaded. i laid it across the turnip barrel, pointin’ it at pap, and chilled behind it waitin’ for him to stir. damn, time was draggin’ like a laggy server.

chapter vii.

“git up! what you ’bout?”

i popped my eyes open and peeped around, tryna figure out where i was. it was post-sunrise, and i’d been in deep sleep mode. pap was looming over me, lookin’ all sour and messed up too. he snarled:

“what you doin’ with this gun?”

i figured he had zero clue about what he’d been up to, so i kept it 100 and said:

“someone was tryin’ to break in, so i was layin’ low for them.”

“why didn’t you drag me out?”

“yo, i tried, but couldn’t move you – you were stuck like a frozen pixel.”

“alright, enough rabbithole talk. bounce out and scope if there’s any fish on the line for breakfast. i’ll roll by in a hot minute.”

he unlocked the door, and i dipped out to the riverbank. i peeped some broken limbs floatin’ by and bits of bark here and there – sign that the river was flexin’ its rise mode. i figured if i was in town in this june rise, i’d be living the dream; ‘cause when the river goes up, loads of cordwood and log rafts start driftin’ by – sometimes a whole squad, so all you gotta do is snag ‘em and flip them at the wharf or sawmill, no cap.

i cruised up the bank, one eye on pap and the other on what drift might roll by. outta nowhere, a slick canoe appeared – a total beaut, like thirteen or fourteen feet long, ridin’ high like some next-level duck. i bounced head-first off the bank like a frog, clothes and all, and sprinted for the canoe. i half-expected someone was chillaxin’ in it, ‘cause peeps often set up decoys like that to troll others; usually, when a dude hauled a skiff, someone would jump up to roast him. but nah, this time it was legit a drift-canoe, and i hauled it in and paddled her ashore. i was thinkin’, “pap’s gonna lose his mind when he sees this – she’s worth mad cheddar.” but when i hit the shore, pap was MIA. as i ran her into a gnarly little creek, all tangled with vines and willows, a lightbulb dropped: i’d stash her clean, and instead of buggin’ out into the woods when i dipped, i’d cruise fifty miles down the river and camp in one chill spot – no more hardcore foot trippin’.

it was hella close to the shanty, and i kept hearin’ pap’s steps comin’ up, but i hid her tight; then i scoped out a bunch of willows and peeped pap down the path, tryna snipe a bird with his gun. so he hadn’t clocked my move.

once he bounced off, i got busy riggin’ up a “trot” line. pap started throwin’ shade for bein’ hella slow, but i clapped back sayin’ i’d gone for a swim in the river – that’s why i took forever. i knew he’d peep i was soaked, then he’d start grillin’ questions. we hauled in five fat catfish off the lines and dipped back home.

after breakfast, we chilled out to crash ‘cause we were both hella beat. that’s when i started schemin’ that if i could rig something to keep pap and the widow from trailin’ me, it’d be way smarter than trustin’ pure luck to dip out before they caught my vibe – ‘cause, ngl, all kinds of crazy shit could go down. i didn’t get a brainwave for a hot minute, but then pap stirred up to chug another barrel of water and dropped this gem:

“next time some dude creeps around here, you better drag me out, ya hear? that dude ain’t here for good vibes. i’d blast him, no cap. next time you pull me out, ya hear?”

and then he crashed again; but his rant sparked the exact idea i needed. i whispered to myself, “yo, i can set this up so no one thinks about tailin’ me.”

around noon, we bounced and trekked up the bank. the river was risin’ hella fast, and driftwood was floatin’ by like it was on a slow-mo parade. before long, a chunk of a log raft – nine logs jammed real tight – showed up. we jacked the skiff and towed it ashore. dinner was served. anyone but pap would have hung around the day for extra loot; but that wasn’t pap’s hustle. nine logs was plenty for one run – he was all about flippin’ it fast and headin’ to town to score. so he locked me up, grabbed the skiff, and started towin’ the raft around half-past three. i was pretty sure he wasn’t comin’ back that night. i waited until i was sure he’d dipped good, then whipped out my saw and went back at that log like a boss. before he hit the other side of the river, i was already ghost – him and his raft were just a smudge drifting down the stream.

i copped the sack of corn meal and hustled it to the sneak spot where i stashed the canoe, shoved aside some vines and branches, and tucked it in; then i did the same with the bacon side; then the whisky jug. i scooped up all the coffee and sugar there was, all the ammo, the wadding, the bucket and gourd, a dipper, a tin cup, my old saw, two blankets, the skillet, and the coffee pot. i snagged fish-lines, matches, and every little trinket worth a dime. i cleaned out the whole spot. i wanted an axe too, but nada – only the one chillin’ at the woodpile, and i was well aware why i was gonna leave that be. i pulled out the gun, and now i was set.

i had scraped the ground hard, crawlin’ out of that hole and draggin’ out a bunch of stuff. so i fixed up the exterior by scatterin’ dust all over to cover the smooth patches and sawdust trails. then i jammed that piece of log back in place, propped it up with two rocks underneath and one against it to keep it from bouncin’ – it was kinda tilted and didn’t quite touch the earth. if you were standin’ like four or five feet away and didn’t know it was sawed, you’d never peep it; plus, this was the back of the cabin, a spot no one would normally mess around in.

the grass was deep enough that no tracks led to the canoe, so i was all stealth mode. i circled around to scope my work. i parked on the bank, peeped the river – everything was solid. then i grabbed the gun and bounced up into the woods, huntin’ for some birds, when i spotted a wild pig – those hogs just go savage in these parts once they dip outta the prairie farms. i popped this dude with a shot and hauled him into camp.

i snatched up the axe and smashed the door like it was a noob in a mosh pit. i went to town on it – hackin’ and choppin’ hard. i dragged the pig back nearly to the table, hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him on the hard-packed ground to bleed out; i say “ground” ‘cause it was legit ground – no boards, just raw dirt. next up, i grabbed an old sack, stuffed it with as many big rocks as i could haul, and started draggin’ it from the pig, running it all the way to the door, through the woods, down to the river – dumped it in, and it sank outta sight. you’d totally peep signs of somethin’ dragged on the ground. i was lowkey wishin’ tom sawyer was around; i knew he’d be all over this kinda drama, adding his fancy flair – no one could make a chaotic masterpiece like tom sawyer.

lastly, i tugged out some of my hair, slathered the axe with blood, stuck it on the backside, and lobbed it in the corner. then i hoisted the pig up, pressed him against my chest with my jacket (to keep the drips in check) till i got to a solid spot below the house, and then dumped him into the river. then a new idea hit me. so i scooped up the bag of meal and my old saw from the canoe, hauled ‘em to the house. i took the sack to its old spot and ripped a hole in the bottom with the saw – ‘cause, real talk, there weren’t any fancy knives or forks ‘round here – pap always did his cookin’ with that old clasp-knife. after that, i lugged the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that stretched like five miles wide and was packed with rushes – and ducks too in season, no cap. there was a slough, or creek, trickling out on the other side that ran miles away – i ain’t even know where, but it wasn’t connectin’ to the river. the meal leaked out, creatin’ a tiny trail all the way to the lake. i even dropped pap’s whetstone there to make it look like a total accident. then i tied up the rip in the sack with some string so it wouldn’t keep leakin’, and scooped it and my saw back to the canoe.

it was gettin’ dark by then; so i floated the canoe down the river under some willows hangin’ over the bank, and hung tight for the moon to pop up. i latched onto a willow, grabbed a bite to eat, and eventually crashed in the canoe to puff on my pipe and craft my next plan. i told myself, “they’ll track that sack of rocks right to the shore, then drag the river for me. and they’ll tail that meal trail all the way to the lake and probe down the creek to hunt down the robbers who offed me and swiped my goods. they’re never gonna search the river for nothin’ but my dead body. soon enough, they’ll get bored and bounce, leavin’ me in peace.” aight; i can dip wherever i want. jackson’s island is totally clutch for me; i know that spot inside out, and no one ever shows up there. plus, i can paddle into town at night and ghost around snagging whatever i fancy. jackson’s island is the move.

i was mad tired, and next thing i know, i’m out cold. when i finally woke up, for a split second i had zero clue where i was. i sat up, peeped around all jittery, then it all clicked. the river stretched for miles – the moon was blazin’ so bright that i could count the drift logs slippin’ by in a slick row, all dark and silent, hundreds of yards offshore. everything was dead quiet, like the late hours – and it smelled hella eerie. you feel me?

i stretched out, about to unhook and bounce when i heard a noise echoin’ over the water. i listened close. soon enough, i peeped what it was. it was that low-key regular sound of oars doin’ their thing in a still night’s rowlocks. i peered out through the droppin’ willow branches, and there it was – a skiff driftin’ on the water, comin’ in. couldn’t tell how many peeps were aboard. it kept comin’, and when it was rollin’ right past me, i saw there was only one dude in it. i was like, “yo, maybe it’s pap, though i wasn’t expectin’ him.” he dropped below my line with the current, and soon after, he cruised up shore in the chill water – so close that i could literally stretch out my hand, grab the gun, and feel him. yup, it was pap, and surprisingly sober given the smooth way he handled his oars.

i didn’t waste a hot sec. the next minute, i was sped down the stream, low-key quick but totally chill under the bank’s shade. i put in two and a half miles, then veered a quarter mile or more toward the river’s middle ‘cause soon enough, i’d be runnin’ by the ferry landing where peeps might spot me and call out. i dipped into a clump of driftwood, lay low in the bottom of the canoe, and let it float.

i kicked back, enjoyed a solid chill session and a long pipe smoke, starin’ up at the clear sky – not a single cloud. the sky looked mega deep when you’re starin’ up in that moonlight; i swear, it was a vibe i’d never seen before. and damn, the distance you can hear water sounds on nights like that! i caught voices at the ferry landing. i heard every single word – one dude was like, “yo, these are long days and short nights, bro.” another was like, “nah, this ain’t one of those short ones,” and then they cracked up, rehashin’ the joke, then woke up another homie and filled him in, though he wasn’t laughing – he snapped and was all, “let it be, man.” the first dude claimed he’d tell his old lady ‘cause she’d totally dig it; but the other was like, “that ain’t nothin’ compared to some of the wild stuff i’ve seen.” i even heard someone mumble it was nearly three, hopin’ daylight wouldn’t be a week away. after that, the talk drifted off, words gettin’ fuzzier, but i still caught the low mumbles and the occasional laugh from far out.

i was now chillin’ below the ferry. i peeped it up, and there it was – jackson’s island, about two and a half miles downstream, packed with heavy timber, risin’ out of the river like a stealth steamboat without any bling lights. there wasn’t even a sign of the bar at the head – that whole area was submerged now.

i hit the island fast – shot past the head at a ripping pace ‘cause the current was mad swift, then slid into some dead water and landed on the side toward the illinois shore. i steered the canoe into a deep dent in the bank i knew of; had to swerve through some willows to get in; and once i secured it, no soul could peep the canoe from the outside.

i climbed up and set myself on a log at the head of the island, starin’ out at the vast river, the black driftwood, and the town three miles away, where three or four lights were twinklin’. then, outta nowhere, this massive lumber-raft appeared about a mile upstream, floatin’ with a lantern in its center. i watched it creep down slow, and when it was right beside me, i caught a dude say, “stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” loud and clear, like he was right next to me.

the sky started gettin’ that little gray tint; so i slid into the woods and crashed for a nap before breakfast.

chapter viii.

when i woke, the sun was high – i figured it was past eight. i was loungin’ in the grass and cool shade, deep in thought, feelin’ mega comfortable and satisfied. i could peep the sun through a couple of holes, but mostly it was just thick trees everywhere – dark and moody vibes. spots of sunlight danced on the ground through the leaves, swayin’ here and there like a chill breeze was in play. a couple of squirrels kicked back on a limb, jabberin’ at me like they were my homies.

i was straight-up lazy and cozy – zero motivation to bounce up and whip up breakfast. then, i was dozin’ off when suddenly i caught this deep “boom!” echoing from up the river. i perked up, rested my elbow, and listened; before long, that boom hit again. i hopped up and peeked through a gap in the leaves, and saw a huge plume of smoke driftin’ on the water way up near the ferry. and there was the ferry-boat, jam-packed with peeps, floatin’ down. i immediately peeped what was goin’ down. “boom!” i watched as white smoke shot out from the side of the ferry-boat. check it – they were blastin’ cannon over the water, tryna force my dead body to surface.

i was mad hungry, but i wasn’t about to spark a fire – fearin’ they might clock the smoke. so, i sat there, watchin’ the cannon-smoke and listenin’ to the continuous boom. the river was a mile wide there, and it always looked pretty dope on a summer morn – so i was secretly enjoyin’ the show of them huntin’ for my remains while i just hung out. then it hit me – they always mix quicksilver in their bread loaves and set ‘em afloat, ‘cause they zero in on a drowned carcass and chill there. so, i thought, “bet, i’ll keep an eye out – if any of those floaters show up for my remainders, i’ll put on a show they won’t forget.” i hopped over to the illinois edge of the island to see what vibes were poppin’, and man, i wasn’t disappointed. a massive double loaf drifted by, and i almost snagged it with a long stick – but yo, my foot slipped and it floated even further. of course, i was right where the current was strongest near shore – i knew the drill. but soon, another one rolled in, and this time i bagged it. i yanked out the plug, shook off that dab of quicksilver, and chomped down hard. this was “baker’s bread” – quality eats, not your basic low-down corn-pone.

i parked myself among the leaves on a log, munching on the bread and peeping the ferry-boat, feeling super satisfied. then, something clicked. i was like, “yo, i bet the widow or the parson or someone prayed that this bread would find me – and look, it totally did. so, bet there’s some magic in it. not the kind that works for me though – i guess it only vibes with the right crew.”

i lit up my pipe, sucked on a long, thought-out smoke, and kept watchin’. the ferry-boat floated with the current, and i figured i’d get a good read on who was onboard when it came close to where the bread dropped. when it cruised real near, i stubbed out my pipe and peeped where i’d tossed the bread, then laid down behind a log on the bank in a chill open spot. at the fork of the log, i could peep through, scoped in on the whole scene.

by-and-by she rolled up, drifting super close so the crew could just dip off a plank and hit the shore. most of the squad was chillin’ on the boat—pap, judge thatcher, bessie thatcher, jo harper, tom sawyer, his old aunt polly, sid and mary, and a whole bunch more. everyone was spilling tea about the murder, but then the captain cut in and was like, “yo, keep it 100; the current’s takin’ over real close now, and maybe our guy washed ashore and got tangled up in the brush by the water’s edge. gotta hope, anyway.”

i wasn’t really feelin’ that vibe. they all crammed up, leanin’ over the rails so close it was almost in my face, and stood so still like it was a final boss vibe. i could peep every detail about them, but no cap they couldn’t peep me. then the captain went off and shouted, “stand away!” and the cannon blew a blast so wild right in front of me that it totally deef-ed my ears with the noise and nearly blinded me with smoke—i legit thought i was done for. ngl, if they’d been packing bullets, i bet they’d have snagged that corpse, fr. but mad props—I soon realized i wasn’t hurt, all thanks to some major luck. the boat floated on and dipped out of sight around the island’s shoulder. i could catch the boom pop now and then, fading into the distance, and after about an hour the noise just dipped out. the island spanned like three miles, and i figured they’d hit the bottom and be bailing, but nah—they weren’t done yet. they turned around the base and cruised up the channel on the missouri side, steaming along and droppin’ beats from the cannon every so often. i dipped over to that side and peeped them; when they lined up at the island’s head, they stopped the cannon fire, dropped down to the missouri shore, and bounced back to town.

i was like, yo, i’m straight now—nobody’s gonna come hunting for me. i grabbed my traps from the canoe and set up a lit camp deep in the woods. i rigged a makeshift tent out of my blankets to stash my gear so the rain couldn’t crash my vibe. i snagged a fat catfish and hacked it open with my saw, and as sundown hit, i lit my campfire and grubbed down. then i threw out a line to flex some fish for breakfast.

when it got dark, i chilled by the campfire, puffin’ smoke and feeling mad content; but real talk, loneliness started creeping in. so i bounced over to the bank, vibed with the current swashing by, counted stars, driftwood logs, and rafts floatin’ past, and then crashed—there’s literally no better way to kill time when you’re solo; eventually, you just grow out of that lonesome mood.

and that vibe went on for like three full days and nights—no cap, same old loop every time. but the next day, i went on an exploration sesh around the island. i was the boss of that spot—it was totally my playground, and i just had to scope every inch; mostly, i was just tryna pass the time. i scored mad strawberries, ripe and on point; plus, some fresh green summer grapes, green razberries, and even barely-there green blackberries just starting to pop. i figured those would be clutch later on.

so i wandered deep in the woods till i figured i wasn’t far from the island’s base. i kept my piece on me, though no cap i hadn’t shot a thing—it was all for protection, in case i needed to flex on some game for dinner. at one point, bruh almost stepped on a chunky snake, and it slid off like it was on a mission through the grass and blooms, so i chased after it hopin’ for a shot. i kept clippin’ along until, outta nowhere, i bounced right onto the ashes of a still-smokin’ campfire.

my heart legit jumped in my chest. i didn’t even pause to scope it out—I just uncocked my gun and dipped in full stealth-mode on my tiptoes, moving as fast as i could. every few seconds, i pried myself from the thick leaves to listen, but my heavy breath was drowning out everything else. i tiptoed further, then paused again, over and over. if i spotted a stump, i swore it was a dude; if a twig snapped beneath me, it felt like someone just split my breath in half—and i only got the short half, no cap.

when i finally hit camp, i was hella shook, but i was like, “this ain’t the time for clownin’ around.” so i hustled my traps back into the canoe to keep ‘em on the down-low, put out the fire, and scattered the ashes to look like an old, abandoned camp from last year—then i flexed and climbed a tree.

i spent, like, two hours up there; but no cap, i didn’t see or hear anything clear—I only felt like i caught a thousand vibes at once. eventually, i couldn’t stay up there forever, so i climbed down and hunkered in the thick woods, constantly staying on high alert. all the grub i could manage was berries and leftover bits from breakfast.

by nighttime, my stomach was on emergency mode. so when it got super dark, i dipped from shore pre-moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bank—like, a quarter mile away. i bounced into the woods, whipped up some supper, and was lowkey planning to crash there all night when suddenly i heard a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and thought, “yo, horses incoming,” and then caught voices. i grabbed all my gear and stashed it in the canoe fast as possible, then snuck through the woods to spy on what was up. i hadn’t gone far when i caught a dude saying, “yo, we should drop camp here if we can find a chill spot; the horses are beat, so let’s scope the area.”

i didn’t waste a sec—i bounced and paddled away easy, tied up at the old spot, and figured i’d crash in the canoe. 

i didn’t sleep much, not gonna lie—the brain was on full hype. every time i woke up, i swore someone had grabbed my neck. so sleep was literally useless. eventually, i was like, “bruh, i can’t live like this; imma figure out who else is on this island with me—find it out or bust.” and just like that, i felt way better.

so i grabbed my paddle, dipped out from shore just a couple steps, and let the canoe drift through the shadows. the moon was straight up boppin’, and outside the darkness it was legit like daylight. i cruised for an hour while everything stayed rock-still and snoozin’. by then, i was near the island’s base—a fresh, cool breeze blowing confirmed that night was winding down. i steered the canoe closer to shore, then grabbed my piece and slid into the woods. i parked on a log and peeped out through the leaves, watching the moon dip out and darkness blanket the river like a boss. but after a minute, i peeped a pale streak over the treetops and was like, “bet, sunrise’s coming.” so i gripped my gun and slipped off toward where i’d bumped into that campfire, stopping every minute or two to listen. no cap, luck wasn’t on my side—I couldn’t locate the spot. eventually, for real, i caught a glimpse of fire through the trees. i slid over, cautious and slow-mo, and soon was close enough to see a dude laid out on the ground. man, that totally gave me the ultimate fan-tods. the dude had a blanket swagged around his head, and his dome was nearly in the flames. i parked behind a clump of bushes, about six feet away, keeping my eyes locked on him. as gray daylight started seeping in, he yawned, stretched, and tossed off that blanket—revealing miss watson’s jim! ngl, i was hella glad to see him. i bounced over and was like, “hello, jim!”

jim bounced up, eyeballing me wild, then dropped to his knees, folding his hands and saying, “doan’ hurt me—don’t! i ain’t ever done no harm to no ghost. i always been down with dead peeps and did all i could for ‘em. you just bounce back into your own river spot, whah you belong, and don’t mess with ole jim, ’cause he’s always been your ride or die.”

i didn’t take long to let him know i wasn’t toast—i was stoked to see jim, and suddenly, i wasn’t lonely anymore. i told him i wasn’t scared of him draggin’ me to the masses. we chatted for a bit, but he just chilled and stared, silent af. then i went, “hey, it’s legit daylight. let’s whip up some brekkie—fix up your campfire right.”

jim shot back, “yo, what’s the point of setting up the campfire to cook strawbries and such junk? you got a gun, ain’t you? then we could snag somethin’ way better than strawbries.”

i was like, “strawberries and junk—is that what you survive on?”

he replied, “i can’t score any other grub.”

i hit him with, “so how long you been posted on this island, jim?”

he went, “i rolled in here the night after you got clapped.”

i was like, “what, like all that time?”

“yep—indeedy,” he answered.

“and you ain’t had nothin’ but that kind of trash to chow down on?”

“nah, bro—nuffin’ else.”

i threw, “dang, you must be mad starved.”

he straight up said, “i reckon i could demolish a whole horse. i think so. so how long you been on this island?”

“since the night i got clapped.”

“no! then, how you been surviving? but yo, you got a gun. oh, for real, you got a gun—that’s good. now kill somethin’ and i’ll relight the fire.”

so we bounced over to the canoe, and while jim built a fire in a chill grassy clearing among the trees, i grabbed some meal, bacon, coffee, a coffee-pot, a frying-pan, sugar, and tin cups—and the nay nay got majorly set back, ‘cause he figured it was all witchcraft. ngl, i snagged a massive catfish too, and jim cleaned it up with his knife and fried it like a boss.

when breakfast was ready, we stretched out on the grass and devoured our chow, piping hot. jim attacked it with maximum force—he was straight-up starving. then, once we were hella stuffed, we chilled out. after a minute, jim goes, “but looky here, huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty if it wasn’t you?”

so i spilled the tea on the whole sitch, and he was like, “that’s smart. tom sawyer couldn’t even cook up a better plan than yours.” then i went, “how did you end up here, jim, and how’d you get here?”

jim looked mad shook and stayed quiet for a minute, then finally went, “maybe i better not tell.”

i pressed, “why, jim?”

he mumbled, “well, there’s reasons. but you won’t rat me out if i do tell you, right, huck?”

i was like, “blamed if i would, jim.”

he then said, “well, i believe you, huck. i—I bounced.”

“jim!” i called.

“but mind, you said you wouldn’t tell—you know you said you wouldn’t, huck.”

“yeah, i did. i said i wouldn’t, and i’m sticking to that, no cap. honest injun, i will. people might call me a low-down abolitionist and hate me for keeping quiet—but that don’t even matter. i’m not gonna tell, and i ain’t going back there anyway. so now, let’s spill the real tea.”

yo, so check it: it went like this. old missus—yup, miss watson—was always on my case, treating me rough af, but she always swore never to hand me over to orleans. but i peeped a nay nay trader lurkin’ around, hella active lately, and i got all jittery. so one night, i sneaked over, pooty late, the door wasn’t even fully locked, and i overheard old missus telling the widder she was fixin’ to sell me to orleans—she didn’t wanna, but she could get eight hundred bucks for me, no cap, and it was such a fat stack she couldn’t resist. the widder tried to talk her out of it, but i didn’t even stick around for the details. i dipped out mad quick, i tell you.

i bolted and slid down the hill, planning to swipe a skift along the sho’ above town, but people were stirring up mad noise, so i crashed in the old tumble-down cooper-shop on the bank to wait until everyone bounced. i was there all night; someone was always poppin’ up. around six in the mornin’, skifts began rollin’ by, and by like eight or nine, every skift was buzzin’ about how your pap rolled into town sayin’ you got clapped. those last skifts were loaded with ladies and gents peepin’ over to scope the scene. sometimes they’d chill at the sho’ for a bit before headin’ out, so from all the chatter, i got the full rundown on the killin’. i was hella sorry you got clapped, huck, but i ain’t feelin’ that vibe anymore.

i crashed under the shavin’s all day. i was hungry, but not scared, ‘cause i knew old missus and the widder were fixin’ to kick off a camp meetin’ right after breakfast and bounce for the whole day, and they knew i was off with the cattle by daylight—so they wouldn’t even bother lookin’ for me, and the other servants would dip as soon as the old folks were gone.

when it got dark, i bounced up the river road and rolled about two more miles until i hit a spot with zero houses. i had already planned out what i was ‘bout to do. see, if i kept trying to bounce on foot, the dogs would catch my scent; if i jacked a skift to cross over, they’d know exactly where i was posted on the other side—so i was like, “imma take a raft; it totally don’t leave a trace.”

i peeped a light comin’ around the p’int bymeby, so i waded in, shoved a log ahead, and swam more than halfway across the river, sliding into a driftwood zone while keepin’ my head low, and slowly paddled against the current until the raft drifted up. then i swam to its stern and clung on tight. it got cloudy and super dark for a minute, so i climbed up and crashed on the planks. the dudes were chillin’ way out in the middle where the lantern was lit. the river was on the up with a sick current; i figured that by four in the mornin’, i’d be twenty-five miles down the river, then sneak in just before daylight, swim ashore, and bounce into the woods on the illinois side.

but fr, luck wasn’t on my side. when we were nearly at the island’s head and a dude started comin’ at it with a lantern, i realized waiting was pointless—so i slid overboard and made a dash for the island. i had a vibe that i could land pretty much anywhere, but nah, the bank was too bluff. i mostly hit the island’s base before i found a decent spot. i dipped into the woods and figured i wouldn’t mess with rafts anymore, as long as that lantern kept movin’. i had my pipe, a dog-leg plug, and some matches in my cap—and they weren’t wet—so i was all set.

“and so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”  
“how you gonna get ’em? you can’t just slide up on ’em and grab ’em; and how’s a dude supposed to smash ’em with a rock? like, how could anyone even pull that off at night? plus, i wasn’t tryna show up on the bank in daylight.”  
“well, that’s facts. you’ve been stuck in the woods this whole time, obviously. did you catch them shootin’ the cannon?”  
“oh, for sure. i peeped 'em right after you were around—I literally saw ’em roll by through the bushes.”

some young birds started vibin’, flying a yard or two at a time and flappin’ their wings. jim was like, “yo, that’s a sign it’s gonna rain.” he claimed it was the same vibe when young chickens roll that way—so he reckoned young birds were on that wavelength too. i was hyped to catch a few, but jim shut me down, sayin’ it was straight-up death. he told me his pops got mad sick once when some of those birds snatched a chick, and his granny said his dad would croak—and he did.

jim also dropped that you gotta not count out the meals you plan for dinner, ‘cause that jinxes your luck. same goes for shakin’ the tablecloth after sundown. and he said if a dude owns a beehive and then bounces, you gotta let the bees know before sunrise or they’ll all dip and quit work—maybe even croak. jim swore bees don’t sting idiots; but i wasn’t buyin’ it, ‘cause i’ve messed with bees plenty of times—and they never stung me.

i had heard some of this lore before, but not all of it. jim knew every sign under the sun—claimed he had the lowdown on practically everything. i was like, “yo, it all seems to scream bad luck—ain’t there any signs for good vibes?” he went, “very few—and honestly, they ain’t even useful. what would you even do when good luck’s droppin’? you tryna block it?” then he said, “if you got hairy arms and a hairy chest, that’s a sign you’re 'bout to be rich. there’s some major value in that sign ‘cause it’s way out there. like, maybe you gotta be broke for a long time first, and then you might get so discouraged you could even off yourself if you missed that sign of future riches.”  
i asked, “jim, you got hairy arms and a hairy chest?”  
“what’s the point of askin’? don’t you see i got ‘em?” he shot back.  
i hit, “so, are you rich?”  
“nah, but i was rich once, and i’m fixin’ to be rich again. once i had like fourteen bucks, but i went into that speculating game and got totally busted out.”  
i probed, “so what’d you speculate in, jim?”  
“first, i dabbled in stock,” he said.  
“what kind of stock?”  
“like, livestock—cattle, y’know. i dropped ten bucks on a cow, but i’m not tryna risk any more money in stock. the cow up and died in my hands.”  
“so you lost ten bucks?”  
“nah, not all of it. i only lost about nine bucks—i sold the hide and tanner for like a buck and ten cents.”  
“you ended up with five bucks and ten cents left. you do any more speculating?”  
“yeah. you know that one-laigged nay nay that belongs to old misto bradish? he set up a bank and claimed that anyone who put in a dollar would score four more at the end of the year. so all the nay nays jumped in, but they didn’t have much cash. i was the only one with serious funds. so i put in more than four bucks and was like, if i don’t get it, imma start my own bank. of course, that nay nay wanted to keep me out of the biz—he said there wasn’t enough business for two banks, so he offered, ‘you drop your five bucks and i’ll hit you with thirty-five at year’s end.’”  
“so i did it. then i figured i’d invest that thirty-five right off to keep things movin’. there was a nay nay named bob who had snagged a wood-flat, and his master had no clue; i bought it off him and told him to take the thirty-five when the year wrapped up. but someone jacked the wood-flat that night, and the next day the one-laigged nay nay declared the bank busted—so none of us got a dime.”  
“so what did you do with the ten cents, jim?”  
“well, i was fixin’ to spend it, but then i had this dream that told me to give it to a nay nay named balum—yep, they call him balum’s ass for short; one of those chuckleheads, y’know. they say he’s lucky, though i ain’t feelin’ that vibe. the dream said let balum invest the ten cents and he’d score a raise for me. so balum tucked the money away, and when he was in church he heard the preacher say that whoever gives to the poor is blessed by the lord—gets his money back a hundred times. so balum cashed in, passed the ten cents to the poor, and chilled to see what went down.”  
“so what came of it, jim?”  
“nothin’ ever came of it. i couldn’t track that money at all—and balum couldn’t either. i ain’t tryna lend no more cash until i see some proper security. blessed to get your money back a hundred times, the preacher says! if i could get back that ten cents, i’d call it even and be hella stoked.”  
“well, it's cool anyway, jim, as long as you turn rich again some time.”  
“yeah—and i’m rich now, if you peep it. i own myself, and i'm worth eight hundred bucks. wish i had more, but i’m good.”

chapter ix.

i was like, yo, i gotta check out this spot right in the middle of the island i scoped out when exploring; so we bounced out and got there quick, ‘cause the island was only like three miles long and a quarter mile wide. this joint was basically a long, steep hill or ridge about forty feet high. getting to the top was lowkey rough—the sides were mad steep and the bushes hella thick. we trudged and climbed all over that beast, and eventually we found a sick cavern in the rock that stretched almost all the way to the top on the illinois side. the cavern was as massive as two or three rooms jammed together, and jim could actually stand up straight inside it. the vibe in there was chill. jim was all about dropping our traps in the cavern immediately, but i was like, “nah, we don’t wanna be clambering up and down all day every day.” jim said if we stash the canoe in a solid spot and hide all our traps in the cavern, we could rush back here if anyone rolled up on the island—and they wouldn’t find us without their dogs sniffin’ around. plus, he pointed out that those little birds were signaling rain, and, real talk, did i really wanna get our gear soaked?

so we dipped back to snag the canoe, then we paddle-surfed that cavern like a squad of legends, hauling all our traps in tow. next up, we scoped out a chill hidey-hole among the chunky willows to stash the boat. we snagged a few fish off the lines, reset ‘em like a reboot, and started prepping for dinner.

the cavern’s door was hella massive—big enough for a hogshead to roll in like it’s nothing—and one side had a slick little overhang, perfect for a fire pit. so yeah, we sparked one up right there and whipped dinner up like true pros.

we laid out the blankets inside, turning the floor into a makeshift red carpet for our dinner sesh, and stashed all our extra gear at the back of the cavern. no cap, darkness hit hard soon enough, with thunder booming and lightning flexing all over; the birds were low-key screaming “vibe check!” then, boom, it started pouring like mother nature was throwing the wildest rage party ever, with wind blowing like nothing i’d ever seen. it was one of those epic summer storms: so dark outside it looked all blue-black and mysteriously gorgeous; the rain pounded so thick that the trees a little ways off turned dim and crisscrossed like some busted spider-web, and then came a blast of wind that bent the trees over like they were at an extreme dance-off—next thing you know, when the storm hit its peak blue-black moment—fst!—it flipped and shined so bright you could catch a glimpse of treetops flipping around hundreds of yards away, then dipped back into darkness for a sec, and finally thunder crashed down like empty barrels rolling hard down a never-ending staircase.

"jim, these vibes are lit," i said, "i wouldn’t be chillin’ anywhere else. slide me another slab of fish and some hot cornbread, no cap."

"bro, you wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for jim. you’d be out there in the woods starving and almost drowning, facts. even the chickens are on that rain-signal vibe, just like the birds, bruh."

the river kept flexin’ and rising for like ten or twelve days straight until it totally smashed the banks. on the low ground, the water was about three or four feet deep on the island and the illinois bottom, stretching mad miles wide on one side, but on the missouri side it stayed a chill half-a-mile wide ‘cause the shore was just a wall of high, savage bluffs.

by day, we cruised all over the island in our canoe, soaking up that cool, shady deep-woods life even when the sun was straight-up blazing. we zigzagged amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines were so extra that we had to back off and pick another route. real talk, every busted tree hosted rabbits, snakes, and other critters; and after the island got flooded for a day or two, the animals got so hangry they were practically tame—you could low-key reach out and pet a rabbit if you fancied it (but not the snakes and turtles, they’d slide off into the water). the ridge where our cavern chilled was crawling with them; we could’ve started a petting zoo if we wanted.

one night, we copped a sweet piece of a lumber raft—solid pine planks all around. it was like twelve feet wide and about fifteen or sixteen feet long, with the top chilling six or seven inches above the water—a level, dope floor. sometimes in daylight, we peeped saw-logs drifting by, but we let ‘em slide; we were never about that daylight life.

another night at the head of the island, just before dawn, a sketchy two-story frame-house showed up on the west side, crooked as heck. we paddled over, clambered aboard through an upstairs window, but it was still pitch black, so we locked down the canoe and chilled, waiting for daylight to drop.

as the glow of morning began before we even hit the island’s base, we peeped into an upstairs window. inside, we could just make out a bed, a table, a couple of rundown chairs, and a load of random stuff scattered on the floor, with clothes casually hanging on the wall. in the far corner, something that looked like a dude was lying there. so jim goes:

"yo, you there!"

but nothing happened. i hollered again, and then jim goes:

"this dude ain’t snoozin’—he’s straight-up dead. stay put, i’ll go check."

jim rolled over, bent down to scope it out, and announced:

"it's a dead man, for real—naked as heck, too. he got shot in the back, no cap. i reckon he's been dead like two or three days. come in, huck, but don’t even peek at his face—it’s too freaky."

i didn’t even glance at him. jim tossed some old rags over the body—though he didn’t need to, since i was totally not into the sight. the floor was littered with greasy old cards, dusty whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made from black cloth; and all over the walls were the dumbest scribbled words and charcoal doodles. there were two grimy calico dresses, a sun-bonnet, some women’s undies hanging on the wall, and even some menswear. we loaded all that random loot into the canoe—maybe it’d score us some cash later. there was also an old speckled straw hat from a kid on the floor, so i snagged that. plus, there was a milk bottle with a rag stopper for a baby to suck on, but it was busted. there was a seedy old chest and an ancient hair trunk with broken hinges—they were open, but nothing of any real value was left inside. by the way everything was scattered, it was clear these peeps bounced in a mad rush and didn’t pack up their stuff right.

we scored some extra gear too: an old tin lantern, a butcher-knife with no handle, a brand-new barlow knife worth a couple bits at any store, a stash of tallow candles, a tin candlestick, a gourd, a tin cup, a ratty old bedquilt from the bed, and a reticule loaded with needles, pins, beeswax, buttons, thread—basically a whole bundle of random junk. then there was a hatchet, some nails, a fishline as thick as my little finger with monstrous hooks, a roll of buckskin, a leather dog-collar, a horseshoe, and some vials of unmarked medicine. as we were bouncin’ out, i copped a solid curry-comb, and jim snagged a ratty old fiddle-bow and even a wooden leg. the leg’s straps were busted off, but aside from that it was decent—though too long for me and too short for jim—and we never found the matching one despite scouring everywhere.

all in all, we made a pretty dope haul. when it was time to dip, we were about a quarter-mile below the island and it was broad daylight; so i made jim lie low in the canoe under the quilt, ‘cause if he popped up, folks would peep he was a nay nay from a mile away. i paddled off to the illinois shore, drifting about half a mile, creeping up the dead water under the bank with zero drama. we got home safe, for real.

chapter x.

after breakfast, i was all like, "yo, let’s chat about that dead dude and figure out who offed him," but jim wasn’t having any of it. he claimed it’d bring bad juju; plus, he warned that unburied dudes were way more likely to come back and haunt us than be chillin’ in the grave. that sounded kinda legit, so i kept quiet—though i couldn’t help obsessing over who shot the guy and why.

we rifled through the clothes we’d snagged and found eight bucks in silver sewn into the lining of an old blanket overcoat. jim was like, "i bet the peeps in that house jack-pocked the coat, 'cause if they knew about the cash, they wouldn’t have left it." i was like, "facts, i reckon they offed him too," but jim wasn’t down to chat about that. so i threw down:

"yo, you say it’s bad luck, but remember when i grabbed that snake-skin from the ridge the day before yesterday? you were all like, 'touching a snake-skin is the worst bad luck ever.' well, here’s your jinx! we just raked in all this loot plus eight bucks. i wish we could pull a run of this crazy luck every day, jim."

jim fired back, "nah, babe, chill—don’t get too extra. trust, it’s on its way. i promise, it’s coming."

and it did come, no cap. that talk all went down on a tuesday. then, after dinner on friday, we were just laid out in the grass at the top of the ridge, completely done with tobacco. i bounced over to the cavern to grab some more and bumped into a rattlesnake. i took it out and casually curled its body up at the foot of jim’s blanket, thinking it’d be a hilarious surprise when jim found it. but by nighttime, i totally forgot about the snake—until jim flopped onto the blanket right as i lit a light and the snake’s partner appeared and bit him.

jim jumped up screaming, and the very first thing the light caught was that snake buddy all curled up and ready to strike again. i clapped it down in a sec with a stick, and then jim snatched pap’s whisky-jug and started pouring that liquid gold like some next-level remedy.

jim was barefoot, and the snake bit him right on the heel. all that went down ‘cause i was such a dingus for forgetting that whenever you ditch a dead snake, its partner always shows up to cling. jim ordered me to hack off the snake’s head and toss it, then skin the body and roast a piece of it. i did it, and he scarfed it down while swearing it’d cure him. he even had me pull off the snake’s rattles and tie ‘em around his wrist, saying that would work too. then i dipped out low-key and chucked the snake remains deep into the bushes, ‘cause i sure as heck wasn’t about to let jim know it was all on me.

jim kept guzzling from the jug, tripping and yelling every now and then, but every time he snapped back he was right back at the jug. his foot swelled up huge, and so did his leg; but eventually the booze kicked in, so i figured he’d be aight—even though, honestly, i’d rather get bit by a snake than guzzle pap’s whisky.

jim was out of commission for four whole days and nights. once the swelling cleared and he was back on his feet, i vowed never to handle snake-skins with my bare hands again, now that i’d seen the epic fail they can cause. jim said he knew i’d learn my lesson and warned that handling a snake-skin was jinx-level bad luck—maybe our saga wasn’t over yet. he swore he’d rather catch the new moon over his left shoulder a thousand times than ever touch a snake-skin again. honestly, i was starting to feel that vibe myself, even though i’ve always thought gawking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the dumbest, most reckless moves ever. like old hank bunker did it once, bragged hard about it, then got so smashed within two years he fell off the shot-tower and ended up all sprawled out like a human pancake—and they had to shuffle him sideways between two barn doors for a coffin before burying him (or so pap told me). all that for checking out the moon like a total fool.

so the days rolled on and the river dipped back down between its banks again. one of our very first moves was to bait a huge hook with a skinned rabbit and set it up, landing a catfish as big as a dude—6 foot 2 inches long and over 200 pounds. we couldn’t even handle that beast; he would’ve launched us straight into illinois. we just watched him thrashing around until he drowned. we even found a brass button in his stomach, a round ball, and a bunch of random junk. we split the ball open with our hatchet and found a spool inside. jim said he’d been stashing it there for ages, coating it over to form a ball. no cap, that was probably the biggest fish ever caught in the mississippi. jim swore he’d never seen a bigger one, and in the village, that catch would’ve been worth mad cash. they flog fish like that by the pound at the market—everyone’s all over it, and his meat was as white as snow, perfect for frying up.

the next morning, i was like, "this scene is getting slow and dull; we need to stir things up." so i figured i’d slip across the river to scope out what’s poppin’. jim dug the plan but insisted i had to roll out in the dark and be on point. then he was like, "yo, why not slap on some of that old gear and disguise yourself as a girl?" which was a dope idea too. so we hacked one of the calico gowns into a shorter version, i flipped my trouser legs up to my knees, and suited up. jim hitched it in place with some hooks, and it actually fit pretty well. i rocked the sun-bonnet tied under my chin, and anyone who glanced at my face would see something that looked like staring down a long joint of stove-pipe. jim claimed no one would recognize me, even in broad daylight. i practiced all day to nail the act, and eventually got the hang of it—only jim kept roasting me for not strutting like a proper girl and for constantly tugging up my gown to check my britches-pocket. i took his advice and leveled up.

i set off along the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.

i then paddled across to town from a spot a little below the ferry landing, and the current drift dropped me right at the bottom of town. i tied up and crept along the bank. there was a light burning in a rundown shanty that looked abandoned forever, and i couldn’t help but wonder who was bunking there. i snuck up and peeped in through the window. inside, a woman in her forties was busy knitting by candlelight on a pine table. i didn’t recognize her face at all—she was a total stranger, and in that town, everybody’s face was already known to someone. luckily, i was feeling pretty off—afraid that if i stayed too long, someone might catch my voice and clue me in. but if this woman had been in such a tiny town for two days, she’d know all the tea. so i knocked on the door, firmly deciding to stick to the girl act.

chapter xi.

"come on in," the woman said, so i slid right in. she then added, "get comfy."

i did just that. she sized me up with her little shiny eyes and asked, "what’s your name, fam?"

"sarah williams," i replied.

"so, where you from? around these parts?"

"nah, i’m from hookerville—like seven miles downstream. i walked all the way here and i’m dead tired."

"bet you’re hungry too. i’ll hook you up with something."

"nah, i’m straight. i was so starving i had to stop at a farm two miles back; now i’m too full. that’s why i’m late. my mom’s sick and broke, and i’m here to see my uncle abner moore." she went on, "i’ve never been here before—do you know him?"

"nope, i’m still new here too. haven’t been in town for more than two weeks. it’s a trek to the upper end, so you should crash here tonight. take off your bonnet."

"no," i said, "i’ll rest a bit and then keep it movin’. i ain’t scared of the dark."

she insisted she wouldn’t let me bounce solo, but promised her husband would be back soon—like in an hour and a half—and she’d send him after me. then she started spillin’ about her hubby, her up-river squad, her down-river crew, how they used to live like royalty and then totally messed up by moving here instead of stayin’ chill—and on and on, until i started wondering if i made a huge mistake coming to her for the town scoop. eventually, she switched gears to talking about pap and that murder mess, and i settled in to let her spill all the tea. she rattled off the story of me and tom sawyer finding six grand (even though she only pocketed ten of it), all the drama about pap’s rough life and my own struggles, and finally she got down to the part about huck finn’s murder. i asked:

"who did it? we’ve heard mad chatter about what went down in hookerville, but nobody’s sure who offed huck finn."

"i reckon there’s a big chance folks here are dying to know. some even say old finn did it himself."

"no way—is that for real?"

"most everyone thought that at first. he almost got lynched, no cap. but before nightfall, they flipped the script and blamed it on a runaway nay nay named jim."

"why, he—" 

i trailed off, realizing i’d better zip it. she kept going, totally unaware that i had frozen up:

"the nay nay bounced on the very night huck finn got offed. now there’s a reward on him—three hundred bucks—and a bounty on old finn too—two hundred. see, he rolled into town the morning after the murder, spilled the deets, then hopped on the ferry-boat chase and dipped right after. by night, they nearly lynched him, but he was already gone. the next day, they found out the nay nay was missing—nobody had seen him since about ten o’clock on the night of the murder. so they pinned it on him; and while everyone was jawin' about that, old finn came back the next day, bawling to judge thatcher for cash to fund a hunt for the nay nay all over illinois. the judge coughed up some dough, and that same night, old finn got hammered, partying past midnight with some seriously hard-looking dudes, and then bounced with them. he hasn’t been seen since, and they’re not chasing him until things cool down a bit, ‘cause now people think he offed his own boy and set things up so folks would figure robbers did it—allowing him to snag huck’s money without any messy lawsuits. word is, he wasn’t too squeaky-clean to do it. oh, he’s slick, i reckon. if he doesn’t pop back within a year, he’ll be golden. you can’t pin anything on him; soon enough, things will quiet down and he’ll waltz into huck’s cash like it’s nothing."

"yeah, i feel that. don’t see any solid proof either. has everyone finally stopped thinking the nay nay did it?"

"oh, no—loads still think so. but they’ll nab the nay nay pretty soon, and maybe scare him straight."

"so, are they on his tail yet?"

"look, you’re off the hook! does three hundred bucks just drop from the sky every day? some folks reckon the nay nay isn’t far from here. i’m one of ‘em—though i haven’t shouted it out loud. a few days back, i was chattin’ with an old couple next door in the log shanty, and they mentioned hardly anyone ever goes to that island they call jackson’s island. i asked, 'nobody lives there?' and they were like, 'nah, nobody.' i didn’t push it then, but later i did some thinkin’. i was pretty sure i spotted smoke over near the head of the island a day or two back, so i figured that nay nay’s probably hiding out there. anyway, it’s worth a peek. i haven’t seen any smoke lately, so maybe he dipped if it was him; but my husband’s headin’ over to check it out—with another dude in tow. he was up the river, but he just rolled back today, and i told him as soon as he got in like two hours ago."

i got so antsy i couldn’t sit still and had to fiddle with something—so i grabbed a needle off the table and tried threading it. my hands were shaking like crazy and i was messin’ it up big time. when the woman finally stopped yapping, i looked up and caught her giving me a curious little smile. i dropped the needle and thread, played it cool like i was interested—and honestly, i was—and said:

"three hundred bucks is a serious stack. i wish my mom could score that. is your husband headin’ out there tonight?"

"oh, yeah. he rolled uptown with the dude i mentioned, to snag a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. they’re headin’ out after midnight."

"couldn’t they scope it out better if they waited till daylight?"

yes. and couldn't that nay nay see better too? after midnight, he's prob gonna be out cold, so they can slide thru the woods and scope out his campfire even better in total dark mode, if he even got one.

i didn't even clock that.

the lady kept giving me these full-on curious looks, and i was hella uncomfortable. pretty soon she goes,
"what did you say your name was, honey?"

"m—mary williams."

for some reason, i don't recall saying "mary" before—feels like i said "sarah"; so i was kinda cornered and lowkey freaked that i might be mixin' it up. i was wishing the woman would spill some more tea; the longer she sat, the more off-vibe i felt. but then she goes:
"honey, i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in?"

"oh, yes'm, i did. sarah mary williams. sarah's my first name. some peeps call me sarah, some call me mary."

"oh, that's the way of it?"

"yes'm."

i was feeling a bit better then, but i was still dying to dip out. i still couldn't bring myself to look up.

alright, so the woman started dropping mad deets about how hard times were, how they were forced to live broke, and how the rats were running wild like they owned the whole place—and so on and so forth—then i chilled out again. she was dead right about the rats. every now and then, you'd peep one poking its nose outta some sketchy hole in the corner. she said she had to keep stuff on deck to chuck at 'em when she was solo, or else they wouldn’t leave her be. she whipped out a twisted bar of lead, bragging that she was usually a solid shot with it, but she had busted her arm a day or two ago and wasn’t sure if she could throw true now. still, she kept her eyes peeled, and straight up swung at a rat; but she missed hard and cried, "ouch!" because it hurt her arm mad bad. then she told me to try for the next one. i was lowkey itching to bounce before the old man showed up, but of course i kept quiet. i grabbed that lead, and when the very first rat popped its head up, i chucked it with full force—and if that rat had stayed put, dude would've ended up a mega sick rat. she said that was first-rate, and she figured i’d nab the next one too. she then went and grabbed another chunk of lead and a hank of yarn she needed my help with. i lifted my two hands, and she draped the yarn right over them then went on yapping about her and her husband’s biz. but then she paused to say:
"keep your eye on the rats. you better have that lead in your lap, handy."

so she heaved the lead chunk right into my lap at that moment, and i clamped my legs on it tight while she kept talking. that went on for only about a minute.

then she snatched the hank and stared me straight in the face, looking all pleasant, and said:
"come, now, what's your real name?"

"wh—what, mum?"

"what's your real name? is it bill, or tom, or bob?—or what is it?"

i reckon i was shakin' like mad, not knowin' what to do. but i go:
"please, don't poke fun at a broke girl like me, mum. if i'm in the way here, i'll—"

"no, you won't. sit down and chill right where you are. i ain't gonna hurt you, and i ain't gonna snitch on you, neither. you just spill your secret and trust me—i'll keep it on the down-low; and, what's more, i'll help you out. same goes for my old man if you need him. see, you're just a runaway apprentice, that's all. it ain't even a big deal. you've been treated hella bad, so you made the call to dip. bless you, child, i wouldn't snitch on you. now, tell me all about it, that's a good boy."

so i figured there was no point in playin' games anymore, and decided to come clean and lay it all out, as long as she stuck to her promise. then i spilled: my dad and mom were dead, and the law had me bound out to some crusty old farmer out in the sticks, like thirty miles back from the river, and he was treating me so damn rough i couldn't take it anymore; he dipped for a couple days, so i grabbed my chance, jacked some of his daughter’s old threads, and bounced. i spent three rough nights clockin' those thirty miles. i was out there travelin' at night, hidin' by day, sleepin', and the bag of bread and meat i hauled from home lasted me the whole trek—i mean, i had plenty. i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me, and that’s why i hit the road for this town of goshen.

"goshen, child? this ain't goshen. this is st. petersburg. goshen's ten miles further up the river. who told you this was goshen?"

"why, a man i met at daybreak this morning, just as i was about to dip into the woods for my regular sleep. he told me when the roads forked i gotta take the right hand, and five miles would drop me in goshen."

"he was wasted, i reckon. he straight up fed you wrong."

"well, he did act like he was wasted, but it don't even matter now. i gotta be on my grind. i'll hit goshen before daybreak."

"hold up a minute. i'll hook you up with a snack to eat. you might need it."

so she served me a snack, and then goes:
"yo, when a cow's chillin' on the ground, which end bounces up first? answer quick—don't overthink it. which end is it?"

"the hind end, mum."

"alright, then, a horse?"

"the forward end, mum."

"so which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"

"north side."

"if fifteen cows are munchin' on a hillside, how many of them are eatin' with their heads all pointed the same way?"

"all fifteen, mum."

"well, i guess you've been livin' in the country. i figured you were tryna pull a fast one on me again. what's your real name now?"

"george peters, mum."

"alright, now remember it, george. don't go forgetting and tell me it's elexander before you dip, and then bounce saying it's george elexander when i catch you. and don't go messin' with women in that old calico. you might be smooth with a girl, but you could totally fool dudes, maybe. bless you, child, when you're tryna thread a needle, don't hold the thread and drag the needle to it; keep the needle locked and jab the thread toward it—that's how a woman usually does it, but a man always goes the other way. and when you're chucking at a rat or whatever, get up on your tiptoes and raise your hand all awkward overhead so you miss the rat by six or seven feet. toss it stiff-armed from your shoulder, like there's a built-in pivot for it to spin on, like a girl; not from your wrist and elbow, with your arm flung out like a boy. and, yo, when a girl tries to scoop something up in her lap, she spreads her knees out; she don't slap 'em together like you did when you grabbed that lead. i knew you were a dude when you were threading that needle; and i set up the rest just to be sure. now bounce on over to your uncle, sarah mary williams george elexander peters, and if you get into any deep trouble, send word to mrs. judith loftus—yeah, that's me—and i'll do what i can to save your skin. stick to the river road all the way, and next time you hit the trails, pack some proper shoes and socks. the river road's rocky as hell, and your feet are gonna be wrecked when you get to goshen, i reckon."

i bounced up the bank about fifty yards, then flipped my route and ghosted back to where my canoe was, a good piece below that house. i jumped in and dipped out in a mad hurry. i paddled upstream enough to hit the head of the island, then cruised across. i ditched my sun bonnet, 'cause i wasn't tryna deal with blind mode then. when i was about mid-way, i heard the clock start striking; the sound was faint over the water but clear—eleven. when i hit the head of the island, i didn't even pause to blow off steam, even though i was hella winded; i smashed right into the timber where my old camp used to be and sparked up a fire on a high, dry spot.

then i hopped back in the canoe and powered out for our spot, like a mile and a half downstream, going full throttle. i landed, slogged through the woods, up the ridge, and into the cavern. there, jim was straight up asleep on the ground. i shook him awake and said,
"git up and hump yourself, jim! there ain't a minute to lose. they're after us!"

jim didn't ask a damn thing or say a word, but the way he hustled for the next half hour showed he was mad shook. by then, everything we had in the world was loaded on our raft, which was prepped to get shoved outta that willow cove where it had been hid. we doused the campfire in the cavern right away and didn't even flash a candle outside after that.

i dragged the canoe a bit from the shore to peep the scene; but if there was any boat around, i couldn't clock it, 'cause stars and shadows are weak for seeing. then we hopped off the raft and slithered down in the shade, past the base of the island dead still—without uttering a single word.

chapter xii.

it was almost one o'clock when we finally cruised below the island, and the raft was moving mad slo-mo. if any boat popped up, we were ready to jump in the canoe and jet for the illinois shore; but for real, no boat came, 'cause we never even stocked the canoe with a gun, or a fishing line, or any grub. we were sweating so hard we barely had time to think. it just wasn't smart to put everything on the raft.

if those dudes went to the island, i figure they peeped the campfire i set up and waited all night for jim to roll up. anyway, they left us alone, and if my fire tactic didn't fool 'em, that's not on me. i kept it hella lowkey on 'em.

when the first glimmers of day showed, we tied up to a tow-head at a big bend on the illinois side, hacked off some cottonwood branches with our hatchet, and draped the raft with them so it looked like a cave-in had hit the bank. (a tow-head is basically a sandbar with cottonwoods packed as thick as harrow-teeth.)

we had mountains on the missouri shore and mad timber on the illinois side, and the channel was on the missouri shore at that spot, so we weren't stressing about anyone running into us. we chilled there all day, watching rafts and steamboats cruise down the missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fighting the big river in the middle. i spilled all the tea to jim about my convo with that woman; and jim was like, she’s smart—if she decided to come after us herself, she wouldn't just sit and watch a campfire. nah, she'd go snag a dog. then i was like, why doesn't she just tell her man to fetch a dog? jim guessed she probably had that on deck by the time the dudes were ready to roll, and he figured they must've dipped uptown to grab a dog, which lost them all that time—'cause otherwise, we'd be chillin' on that tow-head sixteen or seventeen miles below the village; no cap, we'd already be back in that same old town. so i was like, i don't care what excuse they come up with—as long as they don't catch us.

as dusk rolled in, we peeped out from the cottonwood thicket and scoped around—nothing in sight. so jim grabbed some of the top planks from the raft and whipped up a snug little wigwam to crash in when the weather got blazing or rainy, keeping our gear dry. jim even rigged up a floor for the wigwam, raising it a foot or more above the raft so that the blankets and traps stayed well out of reach from steamboat waves. dead center in the wigwam, we layered about five or six inches of dirt inside a frame to hold it in place; this was our secret fire pit for when the weather got sloppy or chilly, and the wigwam kept it hidden. we even rigged an extra steering-oar, just in case one of the others broke on a snag or somethin’. plus, we fixed up a short, forked stick to hang the old lantern on, 'cause we gotta light that lantern every time we spot a steamboat comin' downstream to avoid getting wrecked; but we wouldn’t have to light it for upstream boats unless we found ourselves in a so-called "crossing"—'cause the river was still pretty high and the low banks even a bit underwater, so upstream boats didn't always stick to the channel—they were on the hunt for the smooth water.

that second night, we cruised between seven and eight hours, with a current pushin' over four miles per hour. we copped some fish, shot some rusty banter, and even took a quick swim now and then to shake off the sleepiness. it was kinda solemn, driftin' down that big, chill river, laid back on our backs star-gazin', and we never felt like yappin' loud; we barely cracked a laugh—just a low, soft chuckle here and there. the weather was mad solid overall, and nothing crazy went down—not that night, nor the next, nor the one after.

every night, we rolled past towns—some chillin' way up on dark hillsides, lookin' like a shiny bed of lights with not a single house in sight. on the fifth night, we cruised by st. louis, and damn, it was like the whole world lit up. in st. petersburg, they used to say st. louis had like twenty or thirty thousand people, but i never bought it 'til i peeped that epic spread of lights at two o'clock that same night. it was dead quiet; everybody was straight up asleep.

every night after that, i used to slide ashore around ten o'clock at some little village and cop ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal, bacon, or whatever munchies—sometimes even snagging a chicken that wasn't roosting right, and taking it with me. pap always said, "grab a chicken when you get the chance, 'cause if you don't want it, you'll find someone else who does—and a good deed's never forgotten." i never saw pap pass on a chicken for himself, but that's just how he rolled.

mornings pre-dawn, i'd sneak into cornfields and jack a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some fresh corn—anything like that. pap always said it ain't harm in borrowing stuff if you intend to pay it back later; but the widow was like, nah, that's just a soft word for stealing, and no one decent would do that. jim was like, "yo, the widow's partly right and pap's partly right," so the best move was for us to cross off two or three items from the list and swear we won't borrow 'em anymore—then, borrowing the rest ain't no big deal. so we hashed it out one night, driftin' down the river, tryin' to decide whether to drop the watermelons, the cantaloupes, the mushmelons, or what. but by dawn, we settled and decided to drop the crabapples and p'simmons. we weren't feelin' 100% before that, but everything was chill after. i was mad glad with how it turned out, 'cause crabapples never hit different, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for like two or three months yet.

we even snapped a water-fowl every now and then—the ones that woke up way too early in the morning or crashed too late at night. all in all, we were livin' pretty high.

the fifth night below st. louis, after midnight, a savage storm hit—thunder, lightning, and rain pouring down like a solid sheet. we hunkered down in the wigwam and let the raft handle itself. when the lightning flashed, we could see a huge straight river ahead with massive, rocky bluffs on both sides. before long, i go, "hel-lo, jim, looky yonder!" and there it was—a steamboat that had totally wrecked itself on a rock. we were driftin' straight for it. the lightning made it super clear: the boat was hunching over, with part of its upper deck floatin' above the water, and every last detail was visible—the tiniest bits all clean and clear, plus a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hangin' off it when the flashes hit.

yo, with it bein' deep in the night, stormy and mad mysterious-like, i was feelin' all the feels—just like any other boy would when seein' that wreck laid out all sad and lonesome in the middle of the river. i was hyped to get aboard, sneak around a bit, and peep what was really goin' down. so i said,
"le's land on her, jim."

but jim was totally against it at first. he goes,
"i doan' want to go fool'n 'longer with no wreck. we's doin' fine, and we best leave wrecks alone, as the good book says. like, there’s probably a watchman on that wreck."

i snapped back,
"watchman your grandmother; there ain't nothing worth watchin' but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you really think anybody's gonna risk his life over a texas and a pilot-house on a night like this, when it's likely to break up and wash away down the river any minute?"

jim had nothing to say to that, so he kept quiet. "and besides," i go, "we might snag something valuable out of the captain's stateroom. seegars, i bet—cost five cents a pop, straight cash. steamboat captains are always stacked, pulling like sixty dollars a month, and they don't give a damn about the price, as long as they get what they want. stash a candle in your pocket; i can't chill, jim, until we rummage through her completely. you think tom sawyer would ever pass on this? not for pie, no way. he'd call it an adventure—that's his vibe; and he'd hop on that wreck if it was his last play. and wouldn't he go all out, throwin' mad style into it? like, you'd think christopher c'lumbus was discoverin' kingdom-come. damn, i wish tom sawyer was here."

jim grumbled a bit but eventually caved. he warned, "we ain't gonna jaw more than we gotta, and keep our voices super low." just then, the lightning lit the wreck again right on time, and we grabbed the stabboard derrick and secured it in place.

the deck out there was mad high. we snuck down its slope to the labboard in the dark, headed toward the texas, feelin' our way slow with our feet and spreadin' our hands to ward off any peeps, 'cause it was so dark we couldn't see a damn soul. soon enough, we hit the forward end of the skylight and clambered up; the very next step dropped us right in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by jimminy, down through the texas-hall we spotted a light! and in that same sec, we heard some low-key voices off in the distance!

jim whispered that he was feelin' mega sick and told me to stick close. i was like, "aight," and was 'bout to head back for the raft; but just then, i heard a voice wail out,
"oh, please don't, boys; i swear i won't ever spill the tea!"

another voice came in, loud as hell:
"it's a lie, jim turner. you've done this before. you always want more than your fair share of the goods, and you always get it, 'cause you swear that if you don't, you'll snitch. but this time, you've pushed it one time too many. you're the meanest, most treacherous hound in this country."

by then, jim had bounced for the raft. i was mad curious, thinkin' tom sawyer wouldn't bail now, so why should i? i was gonna see what the deal was. so i dropped down on all fours in that tiny passage and crept aft in the dark until there was only one stateroom between me and the texas cross-hall. then, i peeped a dude sprawled on the floor, all tied up hand and foot, with two other dudes standing over him—one clutching a dim lantern, and the other rockin' a pistol. the pistol dude kept pointin' it at the man's head and goin',
"i'd like to! and i orter, too—a mean skunk!"

the tied-up guy shriveled up and begged,
"oh, please don't, bill; i ain't ever gonna snitch."

each time he said that, the lantern dude cracked up and said,
"'deed you ain't! you never said a truer thing than that, no cap." and once he added, "hear him beg! and yet, if we hadn't tied him up, he'da straight killed us both. and for what? just for nothin'. just 'cause we stood our ground—that's the score. but i lay, you ain't gonna be threatenin' nobody no more, jim turner. drop that pistol, bill."

bill shot back,
"i don't wanna, jake packard. i'm all for snuffin' him—and didn't he off old hatfield just the same way—and ain't he earned it?"

"but i ain't tryna have him dead, and i got my reasons, yo."

"bless yo' heart for that, jake packard! i’ll never forget you as long as i'm breathin'!" the tied-up man slurred, kinda bawlin'.

packard didn’t even lose a vibe over that, he straight-up hung his lantern on a nail and set off toward my dark spot while signaling bill to dip in. i scrambled as fast as i could for like two yards, but the boat was all tilt-mode so my pace was sus; to avoid getting clapped and snatched, i slid into a stateroom on the upper side.

the dude crept through the dark like a stealthy prowler, and when packard rolled up to my stateroom he was like, "here—come in here." so off he bounced, with bill trailing close behind. but before they could slide in, i was already stuck up in the top bunk, cornered and lowkey regretting it. they then chilled there with their hands on the bunk’s ledge, deep in convo. i couldn’t peep them, but i totally knew the vibe from the whisky buzz they were on. ngl, i was stoked i skipped the whisky; though honestly, it wouldn’t have flipped the script much ‘cause most times they couldn’t even clock me since i wasn’t even vibing a proper breath. i was straight-up shook. besides, you just can’t breathe and catch all that tea. 

they were whispering low and serious. bill was on a murder mission against turner. he goes, "he’s been promising to snitch, and no cap, he will. if we handed over all our shares to him right now, it wouldn’t change a damn thing after the drama and how we played him. tbh, from the jump he was gonna flip and be state evidence; now listen up, i’m all about cutting his troubles off for good." 

"same here," packard muttered, deadpan.

"bruh, i kinda figured you weren’t down—but all good. let's yeet into action."

"hold up a sec; i ain’t dropped my two cents yet. listen, shooting’s cool and all, but there are way stealthier moves if the job’s gotta be done. here’s my two cents: it ain’t smart to go all in chasing a dude with a hangman’s noose when you can quietly handle your biz without extra heat. facts, right?"

"you bet. but how you gonna pull it off this time?"

"alright, so here’s the vibe: we’re gonna scope out and snag any extra loot left behind in the staterooms, then yeet ourselves to shore and stash the cash. after that, we chill and wait. i’m telling you, it won’t be more than two hours before this wreck just breaks apart and washes away down the river. see? he’s gonna get drowned, and he can only blame himself. that’s hella better than actually offing him. i’m not about murdering a dude when you can dodge that mess; it’s straight-up dumb and uncool. facts, right?"

"yeah, i feel that. but what if it don’t just break up and float off?"

"we just chill for two hours and see what goes down, yeah?"

"cool, then; roll out."

so they bounced, and i peaced out in a cold sweat, scrambling forward. it was pitch dark af, but in a lowkey rough whisper, i go, "jim!" and he hit back right at my elbow with a moan, so i be like:

"quick, jim, no time for clownin' or moanin' around; there’s a squad of murderer creeps out yonder, and if we don’t track down their boat and set it drifting so these fools can’t dip from the wreck, one of ’em is gonna be in deep trouble. but if we snag their boat, we can put the whole crew in a hot mess—since the sheriff’s gonna clamp down. quick—hustle up! i’ll cover the labboard (port) side, you hit the stabboard (starboard). you start at the raft, and—"

"omg, lordy, lordy! raft? there’s no raft left, fam; she just broke loose and dipped—and here we are!"

chapter xiii.

so, i took a sec to catch my breath and nearly fainted. trapped on a wreck with a squad like that? legit, no chill! but there was zero time for sappy feels. we had to track down that boat, like, asap—had to bag it for ourselves. so we shook and shimmied our way down the starboard side, which was mad slow—it felt like it took a whole week to crawl to the stern. no sign of a boat anywhere. jim was already like, "i can’t go any further," so shook he barely had any juice left. but i was like, "yo, if we get stuck on this wreck, it’s game over for sure." so we kept prowling.

we made a run for the stern of the texas and found it, then scrambled forward on the skylight, clinging from shutter to shutter ‘cause its edge was literally in the water. when we got hella close to the cross-hall door, boom—the skiff was there, for real! i could barely peep her, and man, i was mad grateful. in a blink, i was about to hop aboard, but then the door swung open. one dude popped his head out just a couple feet from me, and i legit thought i was done for; but he quickly jerked it back in and goes, "throw that damn lantern outta sight, bill!"

he chucked a bag of some random loot into the boat, then jumped in and chilled. that was packard. then bill bounced out and hopped in. packard, all lowkey, goes, "all set—let’s dip!"

i was barely clinging to the shutters, totally knackered. but bill goes, "hold up—did you already off him?"

"nah. you didn’t?"

"nah. so he still’s got his cut of the cash."

"alright, then, roll out; no point in bailing and leaving the loot."

"yo, won’t he get suspicious about what we’re up to?"

"maybe he won’t. but we gotta snag it anyway. come on."

so they bounced out and then slid in. the door slammed shut ‘cause it was on the tilted side; and in a flash, i was in the boat with jim tumbling after me. i whipped out my knife, sliced the rope, and yo—we were off!

we didn’t even grab an oar, and we didn’t chat, whisper, or even catch a breath. we just glided swift af, dead silent, cruising past the paddle-box tip and the stern; then in a minute or two we were a hundred yards downstream, and the darkness totally swallowed that wreck—no trace left—and we were hella safe.

when we were like three or four hundred yards downstream, we peeped a tiny lantern spark at the texas door for a sec, and we knew straight up that those rascals had totally missed their boat and were already in as deep a jam as jim turner.

then jim took charge of the oars and we headed after our raft. for the first time, i started sweating about the crew—i guess i never peeped it before. i was lowkey thinking how savage it would be, even for murderers, to be locked in such a mess. i was like, "yo, what if i end up being a murderer myself? fr, not cool." so i laid it down for jim:

"as soon as we catch the first light, we’ll drop down like a hundred yards either below or above it—in a spot that's perfect for you and the skiff to hide—and then i’ll spin a wild yarn to rope someone in to bust that gang out of their scrape so they can catch hell when their time comes."

but that plan flopped fast; soon enough the storm came back, even worse than before. the rain poured like crazy and not a single light popped up—everyone was probably locked in bed. we cruised down the river, scanning for any glow and for our raft. after ages, the rain bailed but the clouds kept hanging and the lightning just kept whispering, until a flash revealed a dark shape floating ahead—and we were like, "let’s roll for that!"

it was our raft, and we were mega relieved to hop back on. then we peeped a light way down on the right, on shore. so i was like, "aight, i’m on it." the skiff was half loaded with swag that that gang had jacked from the wreck. we hustled it onto the raft in a messy pile, and i told jim to drift along down the river, drop a light when he’d clock about two miles, and keep it burning till i rolled in; then i grabbed my oars and pushed for that light. as i cruised closer, three or four more lights popped up on a hillside—yo, it was a whole village. i slid in above the shore glow, then eased down on my oars and floated. as i glided by, i peeped a lantern swinging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat. i circled around looking for the watchman, lowkey wondering where he was catching z’s; eventually, i found him chillin’ on the bitts up front with his head tucked between his knees. i nudged his shoulder a couple times and then, straight up, i started crying.

he jumped up all startled-like; but when he peeped it was just me, he stretched out real good and then goes, "hello, what’s up? don’t cry, bub. what’s the trouble?"

i was like, "pap, and mam, and sis, and—" then i broke down completely.

he replied, "oh, come on now, don’t get twisted; we all gotta deal with our own mess, and things will work themselves out. what’s botherin’ you?"

"they—they—are you the watchman of the boat?" 

"yes," he said, all satisfied and chill, "i’m the captain, the owner, the mate, the pilot, the watchman, and the top deck-hand; sometimes i even handle freight and passengers. i ain’t as loaded as old jim hornback, and i’m not as wild with the dough or generous to tom, dick, and harry as he is, flinging cash like confetti; but i’ve told him a million times i wouldn’t swap spots with him—‘cause a sailor’s life is the only life for me, and i’m damn not about living two miles out of town where nothing’s poppin’, no matter all his cash and perks. i always say—"

i cut in, "they’re in a mad deep jam, and—"

"who exactly?" he asks.

"i’m talkin’ 'bout pap, mam, sis, and miss hooker; and if you grabbed your ferry-boat and dipped up there—"

"up where? spill it."

"on the wreck."

"which wreck?"

"lol, there’s only one wreck."

"nah, you don’t mean the walter scott?"

"yep."

"omg, for real! what the heck are they doing there, for real?"

"yo, they didn’t get there on accident."

"bet for real they didn’t! damn, they ain’t got any shot if they don’t bounce mad quick! how in the world did they even land in that mess?"

"easy peasy. miss hooker was out visiting at booth’s landing—"

"yep, booth’s landing—go on."

"she was out there at booth’s landing, and right at dusk she bounced with her nay nay woman in the horse-ferry to crash all night at a friend’s pad—miss what-you-call-her, i can’t even remember her name—and then they lost their steering-oar, swung around, and started floating down, stern first, for like two miles, slamming onto the wreck; the ferryman, the nay nay woman, and the horses all got jacked, but miss hooker managed to snag the wreck and climb aboard. then, about an hour after dark, we rocked up in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t peep the wreck until we were literally right on top of it; so we clung on hard—but everyone got saved except bill whipple, and damn, that dude was one next-level cretur! i lowkey wished it had been me, tbh."

"my george! that's the most savage mess i ever witnessed. so, what’d y’all do next?"

"well, we hollered and hustled, but the gap was so wide no one could even hear us. so pap was like, 'someone’s gotta hit shore and snag help, no matter what.' i was the only one who could swim, so i took a mad dash for it, and miss hooker was like, 'if you don’t pull through fast, come grab my uncle and he’ll fix it up.' i hit land about a mile down, and i’ve been hustling ever since, trying to get people to step up, but they were like, 'what, in a night like this with crazy currents? that ain’t smart, man; ride the steam ferry.' now if you’re gonna—"

"by jackson, i’d be game, and seriously, i don’t know but i will; but who in the world is gonna foot the bill? you reckon your pap—"

"nah, that's cool. miss hooker straight-up told me that her uncle hornback—"

"great guns! is he really her uncle? check it: you split for that light over yonder, then turn west when you hit it, and about a quarter mile out you'll spot the tavern; tell them to shoot you over to jim hornback’s, and he’ll cover the tab. and don’t mess around, ‘cause he’s gonna need the deets. tell him i’ll get his niece safe before he even hits town. hustle up now; i’m bouncin’ around the corner to wake up my engineer."

i bolted for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner, i dipped back into my skiff, bailed it out, then hauled up shore in chill water about six hundred yards out, and squatted among some woodboats; i couldn’t crash easy until i saw the ferry-boat start rollin’ again. but yo, considering it all, i was mad comfortable for going through all that trouble for that crew—‘cause few would even try. i was lowkey wishing the widow knew what went down. i figured she’d be hella proud of me for helping these rapscallions, ‘cause rapscallions and deadbeats are exactly the kind of misfits the widow and all the good peeps vibe with most.

before long, here comes the wreck, all dim and dusky, sliding down the river! i got an icy shiver and bolted straight for it. she was mad deep, and i could tell in like a minute there wasn’t much chance anyone was still alive in that mess. i circled her and hollered a bit, but got nothing—dead silent. i felt a bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not too deep, ‘cause if they could handle it, so could i.

then, boom, here comes the ferry-boat; so i hustled to the middle of the river on a long downstream drift. when i figured i was outta sight, i kicked back on my oars, looked back, and peeped her sniffing around the wreck for miss hooker’s leftovers—since the captain knew her uncle hornback would be on that case—and then pretty quick the ferry-boat bounced for shore, and i got in the zone, booming down the river.

it felt like forever before jim’s light popped up; and when it finally did, it looked like it was a thousand miles away. by the time i reached it, the eastern sky was gettin’ all gray; so we bounced for an island, stashed the raft, sunk the skiff, and crashed hard—sleeping like the dearly departed.

chapter xiv.

by and by, when we bounced up, we flipped over the loot that gang jacked off the wreck—boots, blankets, clothes, and a crazy mix of other gear, plus a mountain of books, a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. we had never been this loaded in our entire lives. the seegars were prime, no cap. we chilled all afternoon in the woods, chatting and me reading the books, just vibing good times. i spilled every wild detail about what went down inside the wreck and at the ferry-boat, saying these things were true adventures; but jim was like, "nah, i don’t need any more wild adventures." he said that when i went into the texas and he crawled back to the raft only to find it gone, he nearly peaced out—‘cause he figured it was all over for him; like if he didn’t get saved, he’d be drowned; and if he did, whoever rescued him would ship him back home for the reward, and then miss watson would straight-up send him south. and he was so right; like, he was always right. he had a mad level head, for a nay nay.

i dropped some serious knowledge on jim about kings, dukes, earls, and all that old-school royalty drip—how they were mad flashy in their drip and flexed fancy titles like "your majesty," "your grace," "your lordship" instead of just "mister"; and jim’s eyes totally popped, and he was all in. he goes, "i didn’t know there were that many of them. i ain’t heard of any besides old king sollermun, unless you count those kings kingin’ it up in huge packs. how much dough does a king pull in?"

"get?" i say, "no cap, they can snag like a thousand dollars a month if they feel like it; they can have unlimited cash—everything’s theirs."

"ain’t that wild? and what do they even do, huck?"

"they don’t do a damn thing! what are you even saying? they just straight-up chill all day."

"no; is that really so?"

"of course it is. they just kick it—unless there’s a war; then they go full send. other times they just lounge or go hawking, just hustlin’ and sh— oh snap, you hear that noise?"

we bounced out to check, but it was just the flutter of a steamboat’s wheel cruising down from the point; so we dipped back.

"yeah," i reply, "and sometimes when things are dull, they mess with the parliament—and if someone doesn’t toe the line, boom, heads get whacked. but mostly, they just hang around the harem."

"around the harem?"

"harem."

"what exactly is the harem?"

"it’s where he keeps his wifeys. you ain’t heard of the harem? solomon had one—like, he had a million wives or so."

"damn, that's right; i—I kinda forgot. a harem’s basically a bord'n-house, i reckon. most likely, they throw wild parties in the nursery, and i bet the wife drama is off the charts; that just cranks up the noise. still, they say sollermun was the wisest dude who ever lived. i ain’t buying that though. like, would a wise dude really wanna live in constant blim-blammin’ chaos? nah—he wouldn’t. a wise dude would build a car factory and then shut it down whenever he wanted to chill."

"but still, he was the wisest dude, right? 'cause the widow herself told me so."

"i don’t give a hoot what the widow said, man; that dude wasn’t exactly wise. he had some seriously wack, dad-fetched ways i’ve ever seen. you heard about that kid he was gonna chop in two?"

"yeah, the widow spilled all that tea."

"well, then! is that really the wildest notion ever? just peep it for a sec. that’s the stump—one of the women over here, and over there is the other; i’m sollermun; and this your dollar bill’s the kid. do you expect me to cruise around the neighbors, figure out which one your bill belongs to, and hand it over to the right one all safe and sound like any dude with guts would? nah; i’d just smash that bill in two, give half to you and the other half to the other woman. that’s how sollermun was gonna roll with the kid. now, lemme ask: what’s the point of half a bill? it can’t buy jack. and what’s the use of half a kid? i wouldn’t care for a million dollars even, let alone half a kid."

"but yo, jim, you totally missed the memo—no cap, you’re a thousand miles off."

"who? me? go on. don’t even start with your points. i swear i know sense when i see it; there’s zero sense in doing something like that. the beef wasn’t about half a kid—it was about a whole kid; and any dude who thinks he can square off a whole kid dispute with just half a kid doesn’t have the brains to step out in the rain. don’t even talk to me about sollermun, huck—I know him from behind already."

"but i'm telling you, you ain't catching my drift."

"forget the point! i swear, i know my shit. and listen, the real tea is even deeper—it’s in how sollermun was raised. take a dude who only has one or two kids; that man isn’t gonna waste them—he knows their real worth. but if a dude’s got, like, five million kids running around his crib, that’s a whole different flex. he’d chop a kid in two as quick as a cat, no cap. there’s plenty more. whether it’s over two or less, it’s no big deal to sollermun, dad bless him!"

i never saw such a nay nay. if he got a thought in his head once, there was no erasing it. he was the most hardcore on solomon of any nay nay i ever peeped. so i switched gears and started dropping tea about other kings—letting solomon slide. i dished about louis sixteenth, who got his head chopped off in france back in the day; and about his little boy the dolphin, who would’ve been king, but they locked him up in jail, and some say he kicked the bucket there.

"poor little dude."

"but some say he broke out, dipped, and came to america."

"that’s lit! but he’ll be mad lonely—there aren’t any kings here, right huck?"

"nah."

"then he can’t pull any moves. what’s he supposed to do?"

"well, i don’t know. some join the cops, and some end up teaching people how to speak french."

"why, huck, don’t the french peeps talk the same way we do?"

"nah, jim; you wouldn’t catch a single word—they’re on a whole diff wavelength."

"well, now, i'm shook! how come that even happens?"

"i don’t know; but facts are facts. i copped some of their jabber from a book. suppose some dude came up to you and started saying 'polly-voo-franzy'—what would you think?"

"i wouldn’t think much; i’d just give him a solid bust over the head—that is, if he weren’t white. i wouldn’t let any nay nay call me that."



“yo, real talk it ain't dissin' you at all; it's just straight up asking, 'you got that french drip, or what?'  
so like, why can't he just drop it in our lingo, bro?  
nah, he totally is spittin' it—that's just how a french dude vibes, no cap.  
ngl, that's a mad ridiculous way of doing it, and i ain't tryna catch any more of that useless drama. there's zero sense in it.  

yo, jim, check this: does a kitty chat like we do?  
nah, a kitty ain't on our wavelength.  
so like, does a cow do it?  
nah, a cow ain't flexin' that either.  
so does a kitty talk like a cow, or does a cow chat like a kitty?  
nah, neither do—they each got their own vibe, tbh.  
it's totally natural for them to drop different lingo, right?  
course, no cap.  
and ain't it cool that a kitty and a cow keep it different from us?  
facts, for sure—straight up natural.  
so then, why ain't it chill for a french dude to flex his own style? answer me that.  

yo, huck, a kitty ain't a dude, right?  
nah.  
so, it def ain't smart for a kitty to talk like a man. is a cow a man—or like, is a cow a kitty?  
nah, she's chillin' in her own lane.  
so she ain't tryna mimic either way. now, is a french dude a proper man?  
yeah, for sure.  
damn, then why the heck doesn't he talk like one? holla back, bro!

ngl, i peeped it was pointless spilling extra tea—you really can't school a nay nay in an argument. so i dipped.

chapter xv.

so, we figured three more nights would have us chillin' in cairo—down at the illinois end where the ohio river slides in—and that was the move. our masterplan was to ditch the raft, jump on a steamboat, paddle up the ohio into the free states, and then be totally out of the drama.

on night two, a thick fog started rollin' in, so we aimed for a tow-head to anchor to, cuz honestly, you can't be speedrunning through a fog. when i paddled ahead in the canoe, line in hand to secure it, i only found a bunch of puny saplings. i looped the line around one right at the cut bank's edge, but then the current turned savage, and our raft came barreling in like a boss—ripping that tie out by the roots and bouncin' off.

i peeped the fog closing in, and it got me so queasy and shook that i couldn't even move for what felt like a half-minute—then boom, the raft straight up ghosted; i couldn't see past like twenty yards, no cap.

i bounced back into the canoe, scrambled to the stern, grabbed the paddle, and gave her a hefty stroke. but fr fr, she didn't come. i was so hyped and panicked, i didn't even bother untying her properly. when i did try to untie, my hands were jittery like lag in a gaming sesh—barely able to do anything.

the minute i got moving again, i chased that raft full send, hot and heavy, right past the tow-head. it was all chill until i realized the tow-head was barely sixty yards long, and the second i blasted past its foot, i shot straight into a wall of solid white fog—losing all sense of direction like a total noob.

i figured, nah, paddling ain't the move; i'd probably end up crashing into a bank or tow-head or something. i needed to chill and drift, though keeping your hands perfectly still in that mess is like trying to land a clutch shot with lag. so i started whooping and listening. somewhere down low, i caught a tiny whoop echo, and instantly my spirits shot up. i tore after it, ears straining for a repeat drop. next time, i peeped that my path was veering to the right of it; then after, i was sliding left—yet i wasn't gaining on it at all, 'cause i was zigzaggin' all over while that whoop kept marching straight ahead like a boss.

i lowkey wished that clown would just bang on a tin pan non-stop to drop a steady beat, but he never did. it was in the silent gaps between the whoops that i nearly lost my mind. anyway, i kept hustlin', and outta nowhere, i heard a whoop coming from behind. damn, i got all tangled up—was that some other dude's whoop, or had i spun around, no cap?

i chucked the paddle down and listened. the whoop came again; still behind me but in a diff spot—it kept bouncing around, and i kept calling back until, eventually, it popped up in front of me. i knew then that the current had flipped the canoe's front downstream, and i was cool with that if it was jim hollering, not some random raft dude. in a fog, all voices sound sus and off, ya feel me?

the whooping kept banging, and about a minute later, i slammed into a cut bank lit by eerie, smoky outlines of giant trees. the savage current flipped me left and zoomed past, slicing through a bunch of snags that roared like a mosh pit—seriously, the current was on a next-level speed run.

in a sec or two, everything turned back to solid white and dead still. i froze, just listenin' to my heart go boom-boom, and swear down i didn't even breathe a single hit while that thing was thumpin' like a hundred beats per minute.

i straight up tapped out—that cut bank was a legit island, and jim had dipped to its other side. this wasn't just a tiny tow-head you could float by in ten minutes; it was a massive island, with heavyweight timber stretching out maybe five or six miles long and over half a mile wide.

so i kept it low-key for like fifteen minutes, ears locked in. even though i was drifting at four or five miles an hour, it felt like i was totally stationary on the water. if a snag barely flashes by, you don't even clock the speed—you just catch your breath and think, 'dang, that snag's on turbo mode.' if u ain't felt the bleak, lonesome vibes of drifting solo in a foggy night, u gotta try it once, no cap.

next, for about thirty minutes, i dropped random whoops now and then. finally, i heard an answering whoop echoing from far off and tried to chase it, but ugh, i just couldn't lock on—i soon figured i was stuck in a nest of tow-heads, with dim, fleeting glimpses of 'em on both sides. sometimes there was barely a channel between 'em, and other times i knew they were there 'cause i heard the current splash against old, dead brush and trash hanging over the banks. honestly, i didn't last long chasing those whoops amidst the tow-head chaos; i only tried for a hot minute, 'cause it was crazier than chasing a jack-o'-lantern—sounds dodgin' around and swapping spots like they were in a remix battle, bruh.

i literally had to scramble off the bank four or five times to stop smacking the islands outta the river, so i figured our raft was probably bumping into the bank now and then. otherwise, it'd be sprinting ahead and vanish from our earshot—it was just floating a bit faster than i was.

eventually, i found myself back in the open river, but i couldn't catch any whoop signals anywhere. i figured maybe jim had hit a snag and was done for, so feeling hella exhausted, i crashed in the canoe, deciding to bounce on the chase. i wasn't tryna sleep, but i was so zonked that a quick catnap seemed like the only option.

but yo, it turned out to be way more than a catnap. when i came to, the stars were lit up like a rave, the fog had bounced, and i was spinning down a massive bend, stern first. at first, i was like, 'am i even awake or just trippin'?' and as memories slowly loaded, it felt like everything was coming in dim from last week.

man, the river here was monstrous—flanked by the tallest, thickest timber walls you could ever peep, like a solid fortress of trees under the starlight. i scanned downstream and spotted a tiny black speck floatin' on the water. i chased after it, but when i got close, it turned out to be just a couple of sawlogs strapped together. then i peeped another speck, chased that one; then another—and this time, i locked on. it was our raft, for real.

when i reached it, jim was posted with his head drooping between his knees, straight snoozing, his right arm casually hanging over the steering-oar. the other oar was totally wrecked, and the raft was decked out in leaves, branches, and grime. clearly, she had been through some savage shenanigans.

i hauled myself onto the raft, parked right under jim's snoozing mug, and started roastin' him—flailing my fists and saying:

“hey, jim, was i asleep or what? why didn't u wake me up, bro?”

“woah, bruh, is that really u, huck? and u ain't dead—u ain't drowned—u're back again? it's so unreal, fam, too lit to be true. let me peep at you, my dude, let me feel ya out. nah, u ain't dead! u're totally back, alive and vibin', just the same ol' huck—our same ol' huck, all thanks to mad blessings!”

“yo, jim, what's poppin'? u been hittin' the sauce or what?”

“drinkin'? like, have i been sippin'? did i even get a chance to toss back some booze?”

“so, what got you spittin' all wild talk, huh?”

“how the heck do i talk wild, my guy?”

“how, u ask? cuz ain't u been rapping about my comeback and all that extra drama, like i dipped out for real?”

“huck—huck finn, come on, look me straight in the eye, fam; haven't u bounced already?”

“gone away? what even is that supposed to mean? i never dipped anywhere. where would i even bounce to?”

“check it out, boss, something's def off—like, is it me or who am i? am i even really here, or what? now that's the tea i need.”

“for real, i peep that u are here, no cap, but u also got that tangled brain energy, old fool jim.”

“i am? seriously, answer me this: didn't u bust out the line in the canoe to secure it to the tow-head?”

“nah, i didn't. what tow-head? i didn't clock any tow-head at all, fam.”

“u didn't see any tow-head? check it, didn't the line snap and the raft go brrr down the river, leaving you and the canoe lost in the fog?”

“what fog, tho?”

“like, duh—the fog! the same fog that's been all up in our biz all night. and didn't u whoop, and didn't i whoop, spillin' major tea about how we got scrambled among the islands—one of us getting totally lost while the other's nearly toasted cuz he had zero clue? and didn't i crash into a bunch more islands and nearly get drowned? ain't that wild, boss—ain't it legit? answer me that.”

“man, this is way too much for me, jim. i ain't peeped any fog, islands, or trouble at all. i've been chillin' here chattin' with you all night until u zonked out like ten minutes ago, and i swear i did the same. u couldn't have even gotten sloshed that quick, so fr, u've been dreamin', bro.”

“dude, seriously, how's a guy supposed to dream all that wild tea in just ten minutes?”

“dang, no cap—u totally dreamed it all, cuz none of that even went down.”

“but, huck, it's as clear as day to me that—”

“it don't matter how drippin' clear it might seem; there's literally nothing there at all. i know this cuz i've been right here the whole time.”

jim kept quiet for like five minutes, deep in thought, then dropped:  
“so, i reckon i did dream it, huck; but oh my gods, damn, it was the wildest, most epic dream i ever saw. and i ain't ever had a dream before that knocked me out like this, no lie.”

“oh, well, that's cool, cuz dreams can drain a body sometimes. but this one was a straight-up hunger game of a dream—spill the deets, jim.”

so jim went off and spilled the full tea, reppin' everything as it went down, though he totally hyped it up extra. then he said he had to start interprettin' it, cuz it was like a cosmic warning drop. he said the first tow-head symbolized a dude tryin' to do us a solid, but the savage current was like another dude who'd push us away from that vibe. the whoops were sporadic alerts droppin' on us, and if we weren't dialed in to decode 'em, they'd drag us straight into bad luck instead of keepin' us safe. the whole squad of tow-heads was basically all the drama we'd face with beefy, quarrelsome peeps and shady folks, but if we stuck to our own grind and didn't talk back, we'd boss through, shake off the fog, and slide into the big, clear river—the free states—where no more cap would mess with us.  
yo, it got hella dark just after i hopped on the raft, but now the vibe's clearing up again.

“alright, so that's jim's take on it, but what do all these symbols really mean?”

it's all in the trash on the raft and that busted oar—you can peep it all clear as day.

jim glanced at the mess, then at me, then back at the trash. his dream had locked in so hard that he couldn't just untangle it on the fly. but once he got his head straight, he stared me down, stone-faced and zero smiles, and said:

“what do they stand for? i'm 'bout to break it down for you. when i got wiped out from all the hustle and all that callin' for you, and then crashed, my heart was basically shattered 'cause you were missing, and i had no clue what was going down with me and the raft. then, when i woke up and found you back safe and sound, tears started droppin' and i nearly got down on my knees to kiss your foot, so mad grateful. and all you were schemin' was how to turn ole jim into a clown with a fake story. that whole mess is straight-up trash—and trash is what folks be when they throw dirt on their pals and end up feelin' mad ashamed.”

then he slowly bounced up and strolled over to the wigwam, peacin' out without droppin' another word. but that was enough—it made me feel so salty i nearly would've kissed his foot just to get him to take it back.

it took me a solid fifteen minutes to rally up the guts to go humble myself to a nay nay; but i did, and no cap, i never regretted it. i didn't pull any further shady stunts, and i wouldn't have even tried that if i knew it'd mess with his vibe.

chapter xvi.

we crashed for most of the day and dipped out at night, tailin' behind this monstrous, mega long raft that was rollin' by like a full-on parade. it rocked four long sweeps on each end, so we figured it was packin' like thirty dudes, for real. it had five big wigwams spaced out, an open campfire in the middle, and a tall flagpole at each end. that craft had some serious drip—it was basically the ultimate flex for any raft boss.

we drifted down into a massive bend, and the night got all cloudy and hot. the river was wide as hell, walled in by solid timber on both sides—practically no break or light in sight. we started chattin' about cairo, wonderin' if we'd even recognize it when we got there. i was like, probably not, cuz i heard there's barely a dozen houses there, and if they ain't lit up, how the heck will we know it's a town? jim was like, if the two huge rivers merge there, that's the sign. but i was worried we'd just think we were cruisin' by the foot of an island and slidin' back into the same old river loop. that idea totally messed with jim—and me too. so, what was the move? i said, "when the first light pops, paddle ashore, tell 'em pap's tailin' behind on some trading skiff, a total rookie tryna scope how far cairo is." jim was down with that, so we lit one up and waited.

there was nothing left to do but stay sharp for a light and not cruise past the town without peepin' it. jim kept goin', sayin' he'd be a free man the minute he spotted it—but if he missed, he'd be stuck in slave territory with no freedom vibes. every few minutes, he'd jump up and holler:  

“dah she is?”

but it wasn't—just jack-o'-lanterns or lightning bugs. so he chilled and kept watch, just like before. jim admitted it made him all jittery and feverish bein' so damn close to freedom. and honestly, it hit me hard too, 'cause i started realizin' he was, like, 100% free—and who was to blame? yeah, me. i just couldn't shake that guilt, no matter what. it was so gnarly it kept me up, made me restless; i couldn't even vibe in one spot. i never really understood what this whole journey meant till then—it just burned into me more and more. i tried rationalizin' that i wasn't to blame, since i didn't kick jim off from his legit owner, but my conscience kept comin' at me, every single time sayin', "but you knew he was runnin' for his freedom, and you coulda easily paddled ashore and told somebody." and there was no dodging that—the pinch was real. my conscience was like, "what did poor miss watson do to you that you let her nay nay slip right under your nose without even sayin' a word? what did that sweet old lady ever do to deserve you treatin' her so cold? she tried to school you with your book, drop proper manners, and be all good to you in every way she knew. that's what she did."  

i got so mean and miserable i almost wished i was dead. i bounced around on the raft, cursing myself internally, and jim was jittery too, dancin' around right past me. neither of us could just chill. every time he bounced around yellin', “dah's cairo!” it hit me like a shot, and i swore if that was cairo, i'd just die from the misery.

jim kept spittin' his thoughts out loud while i was having my internal meltdown. he rapped about how the first move when he hit a free state would be stackin' cash and never droppin' a dime, and once he had enough, he'd buy his wife—who was owned on a nearby farm to miss watson's crib—and then they'd hustle together to buy the two kids. and if their master wouldn't sell 'em, they'd get some ab’litionist to go snatch 'em right up.

that talk froze me solid. jim had never dropped such savage plans before. just imagine, the moment he thought he was about to be free, bam—it flipped him. it's like that old sayin', "give a nay nay an inch and he'll take an ell." and i was straight thinkin', this is on me for not thinkin' it through. here was this nay nay—someone i almost helped run away—now comin' out totally blunt, sayin' he'd swipe his kids, kids that belonged to some dude i didn't even know; a dude who'd never done me any harm.

i was so sorry to hear jim drop that, it was such a low moment for him. my conscience started roiling hotter than ever until i finally told it, "chill with me—it ain't too late. i'll paddle ashore at the first light and spill everything." instantly, i felt easy, happy, light as a feather—like all my troubles just vanished.

i got back to stayin' woke for a light and even started singin' to hype myself up. before long, a light popped up. then jim sings out:  

“we’s safe, huck, we’s safe! jump up and crack yo’ heels! dat’s de good ole cairo at las’, i jis knows it!”

i replied, “i’ll take the canoe and go see, jim. it might not be, you know.”

jim jumped up, prepped the canoe, tossed his old coat down for me to sit on, and handed over the paddle; and as i pushed off, he goes:  

“pooty soon i’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en i’ll say, it’s all on accounts o’ huck; i’s a free man, en i couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for huck; huck done it. jim won’t ever forgit you, huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole jim’s got now.”

i started paddling off, all sweaty and ready to spill on him; but when he dropped that line, it kinda sucked the wind out of me. i cruised along slow, not even sure if i was happy to be goin' or not. when i was about fifty yards off, jim calls out:  

“dah you goes, de ole true huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole jim.”

man, i just felt utterly sick. but i knew i had to go on—I couldn't back out now. right then, a skiff rolled up with two dudes armed with guns; they stopped, and so did i. one of them goes:  

“what’s that yonder?”  

“a piece of a raft,” i say.  

“do you belong on it?”  

“yes, sir.”  

“any men on it?”  

“only one, sir.”  

“well, there’s five nay nays run off tonight up yonder, above the head of the bend. is your man white or black?”

i froze—i tried to answer, but the words just bailed on me. i struggled for a sec to muster up a response, but i wasn't feeling it—no rabbit energy whatsoever. realizing i was weakening, i just gave up and mumbled,  

“he’s white.”  

“i reckon we’ll go scope it out for ourselves.”

“yo, i wish u would,” i be like, “cuz pap’s chillin’ over there, and maybe u’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light’s poppin. he’s hella sick—and same goes for mam and mary ann.”

“oh damn, bruh! we’re in a mad rush, but i guess we gotta get it done. come on, strap into your paddle and let’s dip.”

i locked into my paddle and they grabbed their oars. after a stroke or two, i be like, “pap’ll be mad grateful to u, no cap. everyone bails when i holler for help to tow the raft ashore, and i just can’t handle it solo.”

“yo, that’s hella mean and kinda weird. say, kid, what’s up with your old man?”

“it’s like—uh—nothing major, really.”

they paused the pull. we were so close to the raft now. one dude snaps, “yo, that’s cap. what’s really up with your pap? spill it straight now, and trust me, you’ll be way better off.”

“i will, sir, i promise—honestly—but please, don’t ditch us. it’s just that—if you vibe ahead and let me lob you the headline, you won’t have to creep near the raft. please do.”

“set her back, john, set her back!” one hollers. they hit reverse. “keep off, kid—stay on board. damn, i figure the wind just slid it our way. your pap’s got that smallpox drama, and you know it for real. why didn’t u come clean? u tryna spread it everywhere?”

“yo,” i go, bawlin’, “i already spilled the tea to everyone, and they just bailed on us.”

“poor dude, there’s def somethin’ going on. we feel for you, but fr, we ain’t tryna catch that smallpox vibe. listen, here’s the move: don’t even try landing solo, or u’ll wreck everything. just float on down for like twenty miles and u’ll hit a town on the left side of the river. by then it’ll be well after sunrise, and when u ask for help, just say your folks are all down with chills and fever. don’t be dumb again and let everyone guess what’s up. we’re doin’ you a solid here; just keep twenty miles between us, that’s a good move. it wouldn’t do to land where the light is—it’s just a wood-yard. btw, i gotta say, your old man’s broke and in a serious rough patch. here, i’m droppin’ a twenty-dollar gold coin on this board, so snatch it when it floats by. i feel super bad to dip, but damn, we can’t mess with smallpox, ya dig?”

“hold up, parker,” another dude interjects, “i’m droppin’ a twenty on the board for me. later, kid; do as mr. parker says and you’ll be straight.”

“facts, my boy—later, later. and if u spot any runaway nay nay, round 'em up and nab 'em, so u can make some cash off it.”

“bye, sir,” i reply, “i ain’t gonna let no runaway nay nays slide by if i can help it.”

they bounced off and i hopped back on the raft, feelin’ super low ‘cause deep down i knew i’d done wrong. i figured learnin’ to be right was pointless—if u ain’t built right from the jump, then when the heat’s on u got nothin’ to back u up, and u just get wrecked. then i paused, thinkin’: hold up, if i’d been a good kid and ditched jim, would i feel any better? nah, i’d still be bummed. so, like, what’s the point of tryna do right when doin’ wrong is so effortless and the rewards are just the same? i was totally stuck. so, i decided not to sweat it anymore and from now on, just do whichever comes easiest in the moment.

i bounced into the wigwam; jim was ghost. i peeped around—dude was nowhere in sight. i shouted, “jim!”

“here i am, huck. y’all hidden out? keep it low.”

jim was chillin’ in the river under the stern oar with just his nose peepin’ out. i told him the coast was clear, so he hopped aboard. he goes, “i was tuning in to all the chatter, and i dipped into the river, ready to go full send if anyone came aboard. then, i was about to swim back to the raft once everyone ghosted. but damn, how you outsmarted ‘em, huck! that was, like, the dopest dodge ever! i swear, kid, i bet it saved old jim’s rep—old jim ain’t gonna forget you for that, for real.”

then we started choppin’ it up about the bucks. it was a lit raise—twenty dollars each. jim was like, we can catch deck passage on a steamboat now, and that cash will run us as far as we wanna roll in the free states. he mentioned that another twenty miles wasn’t much for the raft, but he lowkey wished we were already there.

by daybreak, we tied up, and jim was hella extra about hiding the raft proper. then he spent all day hustlin’, fixin’ things in bundles, gettin’ prepped to dip from the raft life.

that night ‘round ten, we spotted town lights glimmerin’ way down a left-hand bend.

i bounced off in the canoe to scope it out. soon enough, i peeped a dude in the river with a skiff, settin’ up a trot-line. i rolled on up and said, “yo, mister, that town—is it cairo?”

“cairo? nah, u must be straight-up clueless, son.”

“so, what town is it then, mister?”

“if u wanna know, go find out yourself. if u hang around botherin’ me for another half minute, u’re gonna catch somethin’ u don’t want.”

i paddled back to the raft. jim was mad disappointed, but i was like, “nah, it’s all good—cairo will be our next drop, i reckon.”

we cruised past another town before dawn, and i was about to dip again; but it was high ground, so i pegged out. “no high ground near cairo,” jim noted—i’d totally forgotten. so, we chilled for the day on a towhead close to the left bank. i started gettin’ mad sus, and jim was too. i go, “maybe we totally ghosted cairo in that foggy night.”

he snaps, “don’t even go on about it, huck. po’ nay nays just can’t catch a break. i always figured that rattlesnake-skin was still up to its mischief.”

“i wish i’d never caught a glimpse of that snake-skin, jim—seriously, i wish it never spooked my eyes.”

“it ain’t your fault, huck; u had no clue. don’t even blame yourself.”

when day broke, there was straight-up clear ohio water inshore, and off in the distance was the classic muddy! so, cairo was totally done.

we chopped it up about it. shore-hopping just wasn’t the play; we couldn’t haul the raft upstream, obviously. there was no move but to wait for dark, then slide back in the canoe and roll the dice. so, we crashed all day in the cottonwood thicket to stay fresh for the hustle, and when we circled back to the raft ‘round dusk, the canoe had ghosted!

we stayed zipped up for a while—ain’t much to say. we both knew it was all more rattlesnake-skin drama; so what’s the point of yapping about it? it’d just look like we were hatin’, and that’d only summon more bad vibes—stacking up until we learned better than to stir the pot.

after a minute, we finally hashed out our plan: just ride the raft until we could cop a canoe to bounce back in. we weren’t tryna borrow one when no one’s around, like pap would do, ‘cause that might trigger the haters.

so, we dipped out after dark on the raft.

if anyone still thinks it’s cray to mess with a snake-skin after all the chaos it stirred up for us, they’re gonna get woke when they read on and see what else went down because of it.

the spot to snag canoes is where rafts chill on shore. but we peeped no rafts, so we cruised along for over three hours. the night got mad gray and thick—like the next level of fog. u couldn’t peep the river’s shape or any distance. it got hella late and dead quiet, then outta nowhere, a steamboat cruised up the river. we cranked the lantern, bettin’ she’d catch our drip. upstream boats usually ghost us—they bounce out to follow the bars and chase chill waters under reefs; but nights like this, they come hard up the channel like they own the place.

we could hear her thumpin’ along, but didn’t peep her until she was super close. she was lockin’ in on us. usually, they do that—to test how close they can get without touchin’ us; sometimes the wheel goes wild, and then the pilot pops his head out chucklin’, thinkin’ he’s a genius. well, here she comes, and we figured she was gonna try and shave us down; but she wasn’t even flexin’ a swerve. she was massive and comin’ in mad quick, lookin’ like a black cloud lit up with rows of glowworms; then all of a sudden, she burst out, all big and menacin’, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors gleamin’ like red-hot chompers, and her monstrous bows and guards hangin’ low over us. there was a yell, clatterin’ bells to shut the engines, a wild mix of cussin’ and whistlin’ steam—and as jim bounced overboard one side and i the other, she came crashin’ right through the raft.

i dove, makin’ sure to hit the bottom ‘cause a thirty‑foot wheel was fixated on me, and i needed plenty of room. normally i can hold my breath for like a minute; this time, i clocked maybe a minute and a half. then i popped up mad quick ‘cause i was nearly bustin’. i emerged up to my armpits, blowin’ water out my nose and catchin’ my breath. of course, there was a booming current; and no cap, that boat cranked its engines back up about ten seconds after stoppin’, ‘cause they never cared much for raft life—so she was roarin’ up the river, ghosted in the thick weather, though i could still hear her rumble.

i hollered for jim like a dozen times, but got zero reply; so i snatched a plank that bumped me while i was “treading water” and cruised toward shore, shovin’ it ahead like a boss. then i peeped that the current was driftin’ toward the left shore, meanin’ i was in a crossover—so i pivoted and rode that wave.

it was one of those long, slanted, two‑mile crossings; so i was out there for ages tryna get over. i landed safe and scrambled up the bank. i couldn’t peep much ahead, but i kept hustlin’ over rough terrain for like a quarter mile or more, then i came across a massive old‑school double log‑house before i even noticed it. i was ‘bout to sprint past and dip, but a squad of dogs jumped out, howlin’ and barkin’ at me, and i knew better than to move another inch.

in about a minute, somebody speaks outta a window—without even stickin’ his head out—and goes, “be done, boys! who’s there?”

i be like, “it’s me.”

“who’s me?”

“george jackson, sir.”

“what you want?”

“i ain’t wantin’ nothin’, sir. i just wanna roll through, but the dogs got me locked down.”

“what you even doin’ out here at this hour—yo?”

“i wasn’t prowlin’, sir, i straight‑up fell overboard off the steamboat.”

“oh, for real? someone light that up—what’s your handle?”

“george jackson, sir. i’m just a kid.”

“listen up, if u’re straight‑up real then no front—nobody’s gonna mess with u. but don’t even try to budge; stay right where u are. rouse up bob and tom, y’all, and grab the guns. george jackson, got anyone else with u?”

“nah, sir, no one.”

i heard folks stirrin’ inside the crib and peeped a light. the dude hollered, “yo, betsy, snatch that light away, you old fool—ain’t u got any sense? stash it on the floor behind the front door. bob, if you and tom are set, take your spots.”

“all in, fam.”

“now, george jackson, you know the shepherdsons?”

“nah, sir; never caught a hint of them.”

“well, that might be, or might not. now, all set. step forward, george jackson. and remember, don’t rush—come slow. if anyone’s with you, have ‘em hang back—if they show up, they’ll get clapped. come on now. go slow; push the door open just enough to squeeze in, ya feel?”

i didn’t rush; i couldn’t even if i wanted to. i took one slow step at a time in dead silence—i swear, i could hear my heart thumpin’. the dogs were as mute as the humans, followin’ a bit behind. when i reached the three‑log steps, i heard them unlockin’, unbarrin’, and unboltin’. i placed my hand on the door and pushed it inch by inch until somebody said, “aight, that’s enough—put your head in.” so i did, though i figured they might just snatch it off.

the candle was on the floor, and there they were, starin’ at me while i stared back for like a quarter minute—three big dudes with guns aimed at me, makin’ me wince, i swear; the eldest was gray and around sixty, the other two in their thirties or so—each fine and fly—and the chillest old gray‑headed lady, backed by two young ladies i couldn’t peep too clear.

the old gent goes, “there; i reckon it’s all good. come on in.”

as soon as i got inside, the old gent locked, barred, and bolted the door, and told the young guns to come in with their firepower. they all bounced into a huge parlor with a fresh rag carpet and huddled in a corner outta the range of the front windows—there weren’t any on the side. they held the candle and gave me a solid once‑over, all sayin’, “damn, he ain’t a shepherdson—nah, no shepherdson vibe on him.” then the old man said he hoped i wouldn’t mind gettin’ searched for arms, ‘cause he didn’t mean no harm—it was just to be sure. so he didn’t dig into my pockets, just felt ‘em with his hands and said it was all chill. he told me to kick it, get comfy, and spill my story; but then the old lady goes,

“man, bless you, saul, this poor kid is drippin’ wet; and don’t u figure he might be starvin’?”

“facts, rachel—I totally spaced.”

so the old lady says, “betsy” (this was a nay nay woman), “zoom around and whip up somethin’ to eat for him ASAP, poor thing; and one of y’all go wake up buck and let him know—oh, here he comes himself. buck, take this lil stranger, peel off his wet gear, and hook him up in some of your dry threads.”

buck looked about my age—like thirteen or fourteen, though he was a bit bigger than me. dude was rockin’ nothin’ but a tee and sportin’ a mad messy ‘do. he strolled in, all gaping and scratchin’ at his eyes with one fist, draggin’ a gun in the other. he goes, “ain’t no shepherdsons around?”

they said it was just a false alarm.

“well,” he says, “if they’d been around, i reckon i’da nabbed one.”

they all cracked up, and bob chimed in, “yo buck, they might’ve straight‑up scalped us all—you’ve been hella slow gettin’ here.”

“man, nobody’s chasin’ me, and it ain’t cool bein’ held back; i don’t get no limelight.”

“chill, buck, my boy,” the old man says, “u’ll get your time to shine, all in due time, so don’t sweat it. now bounce, and do what your mama said.”

when we rolled upstairs to his room, he hooked me up with a rough tee, a roundabout, and some pants of his, and i rocked ‘em on. while i was gettin’ dressed, he asked my name, but before i could spill it, he started goin’ off about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had bagged in the woods day before yesterday, then asked where moses was when the candle dipped out. i was like, “i dunno; never heard that one before, fr.”

“well, guess.”

“how am i supposed to guess,” i say, “when i never caught wind of that before?”

“but u can guess, right? it’s super easy.”

“which candle?” i ask.

“yo, any candle,” he goes.

“i ain’t know where he was,” i say; “so where was he?”

“dude, he was in the dark! that’s where he was!”

“well, if u knew where he was, then why even ask?”

“man, fuck it—it’s a riddle, don’t u see? so, how long you gonna crash here? u gotta stay, always. we can just have booming times—no school now. u got a dog? i got one—and he’ll dive in the river and fetch chips for u to toss in. u down to comb up sundays and all that nonsense? bet i ain’t, but ma makes me. damn these old britches! i guess i’d better rock ‘em on, though i’d ruther not ‘cause it’s mad warm. y’all set? all right. roll out, old hoss.”

cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that’s what they served me down there, and no cap, it was fire. buck, his ma, and his crew all puffed on cob pipes—except the nay nay woman, who was gone, and the two young ladies. they smoked and chatted, and i munched and gossiped. the young ladies had quilts draped around them with their hair flowin’ down their backs. they grilled me with questions, and i spilled how pap, me, and the fam were livin’ on a lil farm at the bottom of arkansaw, how my sis mary ann bounced, got hitched, and then disappeared, and how bill went huntin’ and was never heard from again, and how tom and mort dipped, leavin’ just me and pap—and he got trimmed down to nothin’ ‘cuz of his mess-ups; so when he dipped, i grabbed what was left (since the farm was never really ours) and hit the river, catchin’ deck passage, and ended up fallin’ overboard—and that’s how i wound up here. they said i could crash in a home there as long as i wanted. then daylight hit, everybody crashed, and i bunked with buck—and when i woke up in the mornin’, drat, i forgot my own name. i laid there for like an hour tryna remember, and when buck woke up, i said,

“can u spell, buck?”

“yeah,” he says.

“i bet u can’t spell my name,” i challenge.

“i bet u, if u dare, i can,” he snaps.

“aight, go for it.”

“g-e-o-r-g-e j-a-x-o-n—boom,” he says.

“damn, u nailed it, but i never thought u could. that’s dope—spelling it like u just dropped it without any cheat codes.”

i jotted it down, all private, ‘cause someone might call on me to spell it next, and i wanna be ready to drop it like i always do.

the fam was hella nice, and the crib was on a whole ‘nother level. i ain’t never seen a house out in the boonies that was so fly and drippin’ with style. it didn’t rock any iron latch on the front door or a wooden one with a buckskin string; nah, it had a brass knob like the city cribs do. there wasn’t even a bed in the parlor—not a sign of one—even though tons of town parlors have beds. there was a huge fireplace with a brick base, and those bricks were kept mad clean and red by pourin’ water on ‘em and scrubbin’ ‘em down with another brick; sometimes they’d slap on red water‑paint they called spanish‑brown, just like in town. they had massive brass dog‑irons that could prop up a saw‑log. smack in the middle of the mantelpiece was a clock, with a pic of a town painted on the lower half of its glass front and a round spot in the center for the sun, with a pendulum swingin’ behind it. hearin’ that clock tick was pure vibes; and sometimes when one of these peddlers came through, cleaned it up real nice, she’d start tickin’ up a hundred‑fifty times before finally tappin’ out. they wouldn’t take any cash for her.

also, there was this massive, out‑there parrot on each side of the clock, made of some chalk‑like stuff and painted ridiculously gaudy. next to one was a cat made of crockery, and on the other, a crockery dog; when u pressed ‘em, they squeaked but didn’t even open their mouths or change their vibe. they just squeaked on the low. a couple of huge wild‑turkey‑wing fans were spread out behind those pieces. dead center on the table was this cute crockery basket stacked with apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes—way redder, yellower, and prettier than the real ones, but clearly fake ‘cause u could see chipped bits of white chalk underneath.

this table had a fly-ass oilcloth cover, all decked out with a dope red n blue spread eagle vibe and a sick painted border all around – like, straight up epic decor, no cap. they were all like “yo, this came straight from philadelphia,” and honestly, that was peak flex material. plus, there was a stack of books, perfectly Tetris-blocked on each corner of the table. one was this massive fam bible full of bomb-ass pictures; another was pilgrim’s progress, telling the story of a dude who ghosted his fam with no explanation – i’d peep bits of it on the reg, and while the quotes were hella interesting, they were also hella hardcore. next up was friendship’s offering, jam-packed with aesthetic vibes and poetry; but honestly, i wasn’t about that poetry reading life. then came henry clay’s speeches and dr. gunn’s family medicine – basically the ultimate guide on what to do when someone’s sick or straight up dead. oh, and there was a hymn book plus a whole avalanche of other books. and let’s not forget those split-bottom chairs that were mad chill and sturdy – not all janky and busted like some thrift basket.

the walls were dripping with pics – mostly washingtons and lafayettes, epic battles, highland marys, and one titled “signing the declaration.” they even hung up some pieces they called crayons – low-key, one of the daughters (who’s now ghosted) whipped up her own art when she was just fifteen. these pieces weren’t like any generic art i’d seen before – they were darker af than most. one pic showed a chick in a slim black dress, cinched small under the armpits, with sleeve bulges popping like a cabbage, rocking a huge black scoop-shovel bonnet capped off with a black veil; her white skinny ankles were all tied up with black tape, and she was sporting teeny black slippers that looked like a chisel. she was leaning all pensive on a tombstone with her right elbow, chillin’ under a weeping willow; meanwhile, her other hand was casually hanging by her side clutching a white hanky and a reticule, and below the pic it read “shall i never see thee more alas.” then there was another of a young lady with her hair combed upward to a slick top-knot – tied neatly in front of a comb like a fancy chair-back – crying into a hanky while clutching a dead bird (flipped on its back, heels up) in her other hand; and below that one it read “i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas.” there’s also a piece of a young chick posted at a window, gazing up at the moon with tears streaming down her cheeks; she’s holding an open letter in one hand that shows some black sealing wax along the edge, and she’s pressing a chain-linked locket to her mouth – captioned “and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas.” all these pics were pretty aesthetic, i guess, but low-key whenever i was feeling down, they would hit me with a major vibe check. everyone was super sad she died, ‘cause she had a bazillion more pics planned that would’ve been next level, and you could totally tell what the fam lost by what she left behind. but i figured with her edgy disposition, she was probably chillin’ harder in the graveyard. she was working on what they called her magnum opus when she got sick – praying day and night to live long enough to finish it – but she never got that final save. the masterpiece was of a young woman in a long white gown, posted on the rail of a bridge, about to yeet herself, with her hair flowing, staring up at the moon as tears rolled down her face. she had two arms folded over her chest, two stretched out in front, and two more reaching upward for the moon – like, she was deciding which arm combo looked best before yeeting the extras; but, as i said, she died before she could finalize her edits, so now they hang that pic above her bed, and every birthday they deck it out with flowers. sometimes, they even hide it behind a little curtain. real talk: while the young woman had a sweet, gentle face, all those extra arms made her look like a spidery glitch in the matrix.

this young girl was all about that scrap-book life while she was alive, slapping inside obituaries, accidents, and all the juicy drama of patient suffering straight from the presbyterian observer, then spitting out her own mad poetry. and yo, her poetry was fire. check this out – she dropped this ode for a dude named stephen dowling bots who dipped hard by falling down a well:

ode to stephen dowling bots, dec’d

and did young stephen get hacked, and did young stephen dip? and did the sad squad level up, and did the mourners cry? nah; that wasn’t the fate for young stephen dowling bots. even though the sad vibes were cranking up around him, it wasn’t ‘cause he caught any disease drops. no whooping-cough wrecked his frame, nor measles with lame spots; nothing messed with the legendary status of stephen dowling bots. despised love didn’t slam his curly mop, nor did stomach drama bring him down—young stephen dowling bots. oh nah. so peep with tearful eyes as i spill: his soul yeeted outta this cold world by falling down a well. they hauled him out and drained him; but fam, it was too late – his spirit was gone, flexing with the big leagues.

if emmeline grangerford could drop verses that lit up like that before she hit fourteen, there’s zero cap on what she could’ve slayed later. buck said she could spit lines like it was nothing – never needing to pause for a brain break. he claimed she’d drop a line, and if a rhyme wouldn’t pop, she’d just scratch it out and hit you with another, non-stop. she wasn’t picky; she could write about whatever you tossed her way, as long as it hit those sad feels. every time someone iced – man, woman, or kid – she was always on deck with her “tribute” before they even got cold. she called ‘em tributes. the neighbors would spill that the doc went first, then emmeline, then the undertaker – though the undertaker only ever beat emmeline once, when she dropped a fire rhyme for a deceased dude named whistler. after that, she just wasn’t the same; she never threw a fit, but she slowly pined away and didn’t hang around long. poor emmeline – so many times i forced myself to slide up to her old room, flip through her dusty scrap-book when her pics were jamming my vibe and i started dissing her a bit. i was down with the whole fam – dead ones and all – and wasn’t gonna let nothing come between us. poor emmeline poured out poetry about every iced-out soul when she was alive, so it felt hella off that there was nobody spitting verses about her now that she was gone; so i tried to hustle a verse or two myself, but my brain just couldn’t sync. they kept emmeline’s room mad trim and on fleek, all set up just like she liked when she was alive, and literally no one ever crashed there. the old lady held it down herself, even though there was plenty of nay nay around, and she spent a ton of time sewing and mostly vibing with her bible.

yo, so about the parlor – the windows were rockin these gorgeous white curtains, painted up with epic castles draped in vines and cattle rolling in for a drink. there was even this quaint old piano – probably rigged with tin pans – and nothing was as chill as hearing the young ladies serenade with “the last link is broken” and drop beats of “the battle of prague” on it. every room had its walls plastered up, most had carpets on the floors, and the whole crib was whitewashed on the outside – aesthetic goals on deck.

it was a double crib, and the massive open zone between ‘em was fully roofed and floored, sometimes even hosting the table in the middle of the day as a chill hangout. nothing was better, ngl. and the cooking? straight fire, my dude – endless servings of bomb food, no cap!

chapter xviii.

col. grangerford was a straight-up gentleman, fr. i mean, he oozed that classy vibe in every way, and his fam was totally on that high-tier aristocratic energy too. he was born proper – as the widow douglas always spilled – and no one ever denied that she was from the first aristocracy in our hood; and pap, he always hyped it up too, even though he wasn’t any hotter than a crusty mudcat. col. grangerford was hella tall and slim, rocking a dark, almost ghostly complexion – zero hints of red anywhere; he was clean-shaven every morning, keeping his thin face razor sharp, with the slimmest lips, nostrils so fine they looked like they were custom-made, a high-key nose, heavy brows, and eyes so black and deep they felt like they were peering out from ancient caverns. his forehead was mad high, his jet-black hair hung straight to his shoulders, and his long, skinny hands were always decked out in a fresh shirt and full linen suit from head to toe – so white it almost hurt your eyes. on sundays, he’d switch it up with a blue tail-coat sporting brass buttons that slapped. he rocked a mahogany cane with a silver tip like a total boss. there was zero extra fluff about him, and he never turned up loud. his kindness was so real you could literally feel it, giving off major confidence vibes. sometimes, when he smiled, it was a nice little moment; but when he straightened up like a liberty-pole and his brows started throwing off lightning vibes, man, you’d wanna dip to a tree and debrief later. he never had to tell anyone to mind their manners – everyone was on that chill, proper vibe when he was around. the whole crew loved having him – he was like eternal sunshine, making every day feel like perfect weather. but the minute he flipped into a storm cloud mode, it went so dark for like half a minute that nothing could go wrong for a whole week.

when he and the old lady rolled in the morning, the entire fam bounced out of their chairs to give them a huge good-day, only to sit down proper once they were seated. then tom and bob slid over to the sideboard where the decanter was, mixed up a glass of bitters, and handed it to him. he just held it, chillin’, until tom’s and bob’s drinks were sorted. then they all did a mini bow – minimal style – saying, “our duty to you, sir, and madam;” followed by a quick thank-you, and all three clinked glasses. bob and tom even drizzled a spoonful of water on the sugar and that slight hit of whisky or apple brandy at the bottom of their tumblers, then passed it over to me and buck so we could toast the oldies too.

bob was the og, with tom right on his tail – both were tall, handsome dudes with broad shoulders, brown faces, long jet-black hair, and dark eyes that were on point. they were draped head-to-toe in crisp white linen, just like the old gentleman, and rocked broad panama hats.

then there was miss charlotte; she was twenty-five, tall, proud, and majorly grand – top-tier chill when she wasn’t stirred up; but when she got heated, her look could totally stop you in your tracks, just like her dad. she was straight-up gorgeous.

her sister, miss sophia, was also a stunner, but with a different flavor – all soft and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.

each person had their own nay nay to serve them – buck included. my nay nay had a hella chill time ‘cause i wasn’t used to someone doing things for me, but buck’s server was always hyped and on the jump.

that was the whole fam lineup now, but back in the day there was way more – like three sons; they all got iced, and emmeline dipped too.

the old gentleman was flexing a load of farms and owned over a hundred nay nay. sometimes a whole squad of folks would roll up on horseback from like ten or fifteen miles away and crash for five or six days, throwing wild junket parties around the river, dancing and picnicking in the woods by day, and hitting up balls at the crib by night. these peeps were mostly fam – straight-up kin – and the dudes even brought their guns. it was a seriously baller crew, no cap.

y’all, there was another elite fam around – like five or six squads – mostly reppin the shepherdson name. they were equally high-key, well-born, rich, and grand, just like the grangerfords. both the shepherdsons and grangerfords shared the same steamboat landing, which was about two miles up from our crib; so sometimes when i rolled up there with our crew, i’d catch a bunch of shepherdsons riding their fancy horses.

one day, buck and i were out in the woods on a hunt when we heard some hooves – like, someone was riding up. we were crossing the road when buck goes, “quick! jump to the woods!” so we dipped and peeped through the leaves. soon enough, this snatched young dude came galloping down the road, riding like he was straight-up soldier mode, with his gun slung across his pommel. i recognized him – it was young harney shepherdson. i heard buck’s gun pop off near my ear, and harney’s hat flew off his head. he grabbed his gun and charged straight to our hideout, but bruh, we weren’t about that life – we bolted through the woods. the forest wasn’t thick, so i kept peeking back to dodge bullets, and twice i saw harney covering buck with his gun; then he bounced the same way he came – probably to snatch his hat, i guess, but i couldn’t peep it. we sprinted all the way home. then the old gentleman’s eyes started blazing for a minute – pure pleasure vibes, i swear – before his face chilled out, and he goes all gentle:

“i don’t vibe with shooting from behind a bush. why didn’t you step into the road, my boy?”

i was like, “the shepherdsons never do that, father. they’re all about flexin on the low.”

miss charlotte held her head up like a legit queen while buck recounted his epic story, her nostrils flare and eyes snapping on full blast. the two young dudes looked super serious but clammed up. miss sophia turned pale for a hot sec, then her color bounced back once she saw the man wasn’t hurt.

as soon as i could haul buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees, i pulled him aside and whispered, “did you wanna yeet him, buck?”

buck deadass admitted, “well, i bet i did.”

i pressed, “what did he even do to you?”

buck shrugged, “him? he never done did nothing to me.”

i asked, “then why you tryna kill him?”

buck replied, “bro, it’s all ‘cause of the feud.”

i was like, “what even is a feud?”

he shot back, “dude, where were you raised? you dunno what a feud is?”

i was like, “never heard of it – spill the tea.”

buck then hit me with, “a feud goes like this: one dude beefs with another and yeets him; then the other dude’s bro yeets the first one; then both sides’ bros jump in; then even the cousins chip in – and before you know it, everyone’s iced and the feud’s done. but real talk, it’s a slow burn and takes mad time.”

i asked, “has this one been lit for long, buck?”

buck replied, “for sure – like it started thirty years ago or something. there was some beef about something, then a lawsuit to settle it; the suit went against one dude, so he yeeted the winner – which, let’s be real, anyone would do.”

i prodded, “so what was the beef about? land?”

buck was like, “i reckon maybe – idk.”

i pushed, “so who did the shooting? was it a grangerford or a shepherdson?”

buck shrugged, “laws, how should i know? it was ages ago.”

i was like, “no one remembers?”

buck went, “oh, yeah, pa probably knows, along with some of the old heads; but now even they forgot what the whole row was originally about.”

i asked, “so, like, many iced people in this feud?”

buck replied, “oh, for real – mad funerals. but they don’t always kill. pa’s got a few buckshot dents in him; but he’s chill ‘cause he’s light af. bob’s been skewered with a bowie a bit, and tom’s gotten hurt once or twice.”

i asked, “anyone iced this year, buck?”

buck dropped, “yeah; we iced one and they iced one. like three months ago, my cousin bud – a fourteen-year-old – was riding through the woods on the other side of the river without any weapon, which was straight-up foolishness. in some lonely spot, he hears a horse coming up behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson chasing him with his gun, his white hair flapping in the wind; and instead of yeeting himself off and diving into the brush, bud bet he could out-ride him. so they went full drag race for five miles, with the old dude gradually gaining ground; finally, bud realized it was hopeless, stopped, and turned to face the bullet barrage – and then the old man rode up and iced him down. but bud didn’t even get to savor his luck, ‘cause less than a week later, our folks laid him out for good.”

i said, “i gotta say, that old man seemed like a coward, buck.”

buck fired back, “nah, he wasn’t a coward – not by a damn sight. there ain’t a single coward among them shepherdsons, not one. and same goes for the grangerfords. like, one time that old dude held off three grangerfords in a fight for half an hour and came out on top. they were all on horseback; he dismounted, took cover behind a woodpile, and used his horse as a shield. but the grangerfords just circled him, peppering him with shots, and he shot back hard. both he and his horse got wrecked, and the grangerfords had to be hauled home – with one iced and another dying the next day. no cap; if you’re hunting for cowards, don’t waste your time with shepherdsons ‘cause they don’t breed any of that weak stuff.”

next sunday, the whole squad hit church – about three miles away, everyone riding their horses. the dudes, buck included, rolled with their guns, keeping them between their knees or tucked against the wall, and the shepherdsons did the same. the preaching was mad ornery – all about brotherly love and the usual tiresome spiel – but everyone legit called it a solid sermon. afterwards, the crew went off chatting heavy about faith, good works, free grace, preforeordination, and a bunch of other deep stuff, making it one of the roughest, most intense sundays ever.

about an hour after dinner, everyone was straight-up dozing – some in their chairs, some in their rooms – and it got mad dull. buck and a dog were sprawled out on the grass, sun-soaked and asleep. i bounced to our room planning to catch some z’s myself, when i spotted that sweet miss sophia chillin’ at her door, right next to ours. she pulled me into her room, shut the door soft-like, and asked if i liked her – and i was like, “facts, i do.” then she asked if i’d do her a solid and keep it on the down-low, and i was like, “bet.” she said she’d forgotten her testament, left it on a seat at church between two other books, and wondered if i could ghost out there, scoop it up, and not spill any tea. i was all in. so i slid out and crept up the road, and the church was practically ghost town – maybe a hog or two wandering around, ‘cause there was no lock on the door, and apparently hogs love that cool puncheon floor in summer. like, most folks only hit up church when they gotta, but hogs are on a whole different vibe.

i thought to myself, “yo, something’s sus; it ain’t normal for a girl to be so wound up about a testament.” so i shook the book, and out dropped a tiny piece of paper with “half-past two” scribbled on it in pencil. i rifled through it but found nothing else – couldn’t decode any extra deets—so i popped it back in the book. when i got home and bolted upstairs, miss sophia was waiting at her door. she pulled me in, shut the door, and flipped through the testament until she spotted the paper; as soon as her eyes caught it, she lit up. before i could even process, she grabbed me in a tight squeeze, declaring i was the best boy in the whole world, and made me swear to keep it on the low. she got mad red in the face for a minute, and her eyes shined so bright it made her look hella pretty. i was hella astonished, but once i caught my breath, i asked her what the paper was all about. she asked if i had read it; i said nah, and she asked if i could read handwriting – i was like, “no, i only read coarse-hand.” then she explained the paper was nothing but a bookmark to hold her place, and that i could bounce and go play now.

i bounced down to the river, deep in thought about this crazy sitch, and pretty soon i peeped that my nay nay was trailing behind like a lowkey sidekick. once we dipped out of crib view, he did a quick look-around and then came sprinting like he was chasing the latest challenge, hollering:

"mars jawge, if you slide into de swamp, i’ll flex you a whole stash o’ water-moccasins."

i was like, "omg, that’s super sus; he dropped that same line just yesterday—no cap, nobody’s that obsessed with water-moccasins to be chasing them down for no reason. what’s his vibe, anyway?" so i go, "aight, lead the way."

i trailed him for like a half-mile, then he dipped into the swamp, wading ankle-deep for another half-mile like it was nothing. we rolled up to this tight little flat spot, dry and chock-full of trees, bushes, and vines, and he goes:

"yo, just scoot in a few steps, mars jawge; that’s exactly where they be. i peeped 'em before, and i don’t really vibe with seeing that mess again."

then my dude dipped out, slinking away until the trees clapped him out of sight. i snuck into the area and rolled up to a chill open patch—no cap, it was about as big as a bedroom and draped in vines—only to peep a dude catching z’s. and, by jings, it turned out to be my old jim!

i shook him awake, totally thinking he’d be hyped to see me again, but nope—it wasn’t a shocker at all. he nearly teared up from joy, but surprise? nah. he was like, he swam behind me that night and caught all my yells, yet stayed lowkey ‘cause he wasn’t tryna get scooped up and shipped back into that slavery nightmare. he goes:

"yo, i got tweaked a bit and couldn’t swim mad fast, so i fell way behind you toward de las’; when you landed, i figured i could slide up on land without having to yell, but then when i peeped that house, i started slowing down. i was too far to catch what they were saying—i was legit scared of de dogs; but once it all went quiet again, i knew you were at de crib, so i dipped into de woods to wait 'til day. early in de mawnin’, some er de nay nays rolled through, headin’ to de fields, scooped me up and showed me dis spot where de dogs can’t track me ‘cause of de water, and they hook me up with truckloads of grub every night, spillin’ de tea on how you’re gettin’ along."

"yo, why didn’t you hit up my jack to fetch me here sooner, jim?"

"well, it wasn’t worth botherin’ you, huck—i figured we could work somethin’ out—but we’re all gucci now. i was out there coppin’ pots, pans, and vittles when i got a chance, patchin’ up de raft on de nights when—"

"hold up, what raft, jim?"

"our ole raft."

"yo, you tellin’ me our old raft ain’t totally wrecked?"

"nah, she ain’t. she got ripped up real bad—one end was straight toast—but nothing major went down; just our traps got mostly lost. if we hadn’t been diving so deep and swimmin’ so far, and if de night hadn’t been extra pitch black and we weren’t such scaredy-cats, as de sayin’ goes, we’d have spotted de raft. but honestly, it’s prolly for de best we didn’t, ’cause now she’s all patched up almost like new and we scored a fresh stash of gear in place of what was lost."

"yo, so how’d you lock down de raft again, jim—did you actually scoop her up?"

"how was i supposed to catch her out in de woods? nah; some er de nay nays found her snagged on a log right here in de ben’, so they hid her in a crick among de willows while jawin’ about which one she belonged to de most. i rolled in and fixed de sitch by tellin’ ’em she don’t belong to none of ’em but to you and me; then i asked if they were tryna snag a young white gent’s propaty and stash it, and i scored ten cents each—i mean, they were hella down with it, wishin’ for more rafts to come along and make ’em rich again. de nay nays are mad solid with me, and whatever i need ’em to do, i don’t have to ask twice, honey. dat jack’s a dope nay nay, mad smart too."

"facts, he is. he never once spilled that you was chillin’ here; he just told me to roll by and that he’d show me a fat stack o’ water-moccasins. if any crazy stuff goes down, he ain’t gettin’ mixed up in it. he can say he never peeped us together, and that’d be 100% the truth."

i won’t roast the next day too much, so i’ll keep it short. i woke up around dawn, ready to flip back to sleep, when i peeped how dead quiet it was—like no one was stirring whatsoever. that ain’t the usual vibe. then i noticed buck had ghosted. so, curious as ever, i got up and slid downstairs—nobody in sight; everything was chill and as still as a mouse. same vibe outside too. i thought, what’s up with that? down by de wood-pile, i bumped into my jack, and he goes:

"what’s it all about?"

"yo, don’t you know, mars jawge?"

"nah, i don’t know."

"well, then—miss sophia’s dipped! she legit ran off in de night sometime—nobody’s got de deets on exactly when; she bounced to get hitched to dat young harney shepherdson, you know—at least that’s de hype. de fambly found out like half an hour ago—maybe a bit longer—and man, the rush was wild. de womenfolk started stirrin’ up de tea, and ole mars saul with his boys loaded up their heat and rode up de river road tryna grab dat young dude and off him before he could dip across de river with miss sophia. i reckon things are bout to get hella rough."

buck dipped without even wakin’ me up.

i figure he did! they weren’t tryna snag you in their mess. mars buck loaded up his piece and swore he was gonna haul a shepherdson home or bust. i bet there’s gonna be plenty out there, and you know he’ll nab one if he gets a chance.

i hit de river road as hard as i could, and soon enough, i started hearin’ gunshots in de distance. when i slid into view of de log store and wood-pile where de steamboat docks, i crept under de trees and brush until i found a solid spot, then scrambled up into the forks of a cottonwood way outta reach and started peepin’. there was a sketchy wood wall, about four feet high, a bit in front of de tree; i almost dipped behind it, but maybe it was luck that i didn’t.

there were like four or five dudes clownin’ around on their horses in an open spot before de log store, cussin’ and yellin’, tryna box in a couple of young peeps hangin’ behind de wood wall next to de steamboat dock; but they couldn’t even get close—every time one of ‘em popped up on de river side of de wood-pile, bam, he got shot at. de two boys were lowkey squattin’ back-to-back behind de pile, keepin’ eyes on both sides.

after a hot minute, de dudes stopped clownin’ and yellin’. they started ridin’ toward de store; then one of de boys popped up, lined up his shot over de wood wall, and took one dude outta his saddle. all de men jumped off their horses, snatched de hurt dude, and started haulin’ him to de store; and in that very minute, de two boys bolted. they made it halfway to de tree i was in before de dudes even noticed. then de dudes saw ‘em, hopped back on their horses, and started chasin’. they closed in quick, but it didn’t matter—the boys had such a sick head start; they hit de wood-pile in front of my tree and slid behind it, flippin’ de script on de dudes. one of de boys was buck, and de other was a slim dude about nineteen.

de dudes tore around for a bit and then rode off. as soon as they dipped outta sight, i hollered down to buck to give him de 411. at first, he was totally bamboozled hearin’ my voice comin’ from up in de tree—he was mad shook. he told me to stay woke and hit him up when de dudes pop back into view, sayin’ they were up to some next-level mischief and wouldn’t be gone long. i lowkey wished i could’ve bounced from that tree, but i stayed put. buck then started bawlin’ and gettin’ loud, swearin’ that he and his cousin joe (the other young dude) were gonna make up for dis day. he recounted how his dad and two bros got taken out, along with two or three of de enemy—apparently, de shepherdsons ambushed ‘em. buck said his fam should’ve stuck with their own crew—de shepherdsons were just too savage. i grilled him about what went down with young harney and miss sophia. he said they managed to dip across de river safely. i was hella relieved; but the way buck went off ‘cause he didn’t manage to off harney that day—he ended up shottin’ at him—i’ve never heard nothin’ like that before.

suddenly, bang! bang! bang!—three or four shots fired off as de dudes sneaked through de woods and came at us from behind, without their horses! both boys jumped into de river—gettin’ hurt in de process—and as they swam with de current, de dudes raced along de bank, shootin’ and hollerin’, "kill them, kill them!" it made me feel so gross i nearly dropped outta de tree. i ain’t even tryna spill every devious detail—it’d mess me up all over again. i seriously wished i never pulled up on shore that night to witness such madness. i know i’m never gonna shake those memories—they keep crashin’ in my dreams.

i hunkered up in de tree ‘til dusk, straight-up paranoid to come down. sometimes i could hear distant gunshots in de woods; and a couple times, i peeped small gangs of dudes ridin’ by de log store with their heat—so i figured de chaos was still poppin’ off. i was mad down and out; i decided i ain’t never goin’ near that house again, thinkin’ i was somehow on de hook. i figured that sketchy piece of paper meant miss sophia was supposed to meet harney around half-past two and then dip; and i felt like i should’ve hit up her pops about that paper and her sus behavior, so maybe he’d have locked her down and spared us dis whole mess.

once i finally dipped outta de tree, i snuck along de riverbank and found two bodies chillin’ at de water’s edge. i hustled ‘em ashore, covered up their faces, and bailed as fast as possible. i even shed a tear while coverin’ buck’s face, ‘cause honestly, he was hella solid to me.

it was pitch dark now. i avoided de house like the plague and bounced through de woods, headin’ for de swamp. since jim wasn’t on his island, i bolted toward de crick, hustlin’ through de willows, mad anxious to jump on board and dip from that cursed zone. but damn, de raft was ghost! i was straight shook—couldn’t catch my breath for a minute. then i let out a yell. outta nowhere, a voice not even twenty-five feet away says:

"good lan’! is dat you, honey? doan’ make no noise."

that was jim’s voice—ngl, nothing ever sounded as dope before. i slid along de bank and hopped aboard, and jim scooped me up in a big hug, overjoyed to see me. he goes:

"laws bless you, chile, i was straight convinced you was dead again. jack showed up; he reckoned you got shot ‘cause you didn’t bounce home, so i’d just started pushin’ de raft down toward de mouf er de crick, gettin’ it ready to dip as soon as jack rolls back with de news that you’re for real dead. lawsy, i’m mighty glad to git you back, honey."

i reply, "aight—that’s mad good; they won’t catch me, and they’ll think i’m dead and floated down de river—i’ve got a trick up my sleeve for that—so don’t waste any time, jim; just bounce for de big water as fast as you can."

i didn’t catch no chill until de raft was like two miles down, floatin’ in de heart of de mississippi. then we ditched our signal lantern, figurin’ we was free and safe again. i hadn’t munched since yesterday, so jim whipped out some corn-dodgers, buttermilk, pork, cabbage, and greens—no cap, nothing in de world beats a meal cooked right—and while i grabbed my supper, we chopped it up and had a chill sesh. i was super stoked to dip out of all de feud drama, and jim was buzzed to leave de swamp behind. we both agreed, no crib beats a raft—other spots just feel cramped and suffocatin’, but a raft makes you feel hella free and comfortable.

chapter xix.

two or three days and nights flipped by; i swear they glided past, all smooth and chill. here’s how we kicked it: de river down there was beast-mode big—sometimes a mile and a half wide. we’d run at night and bunk up, layin’ low during de day; as soon as de night hit its lowest, we’d stop cruisin’ and tie up—almost always in de dead water under a tow-head—and then hack up some young cottonwoods and willows to cloak our raft. once de lines were set, we’d slide back into de river for a quick swim to freshen up and cool off; then we’d settle on de sandy bottom where de water was knee-deep and watch de sunrise. not a single peep anywhere—just dead silence, like de whole world was catchin’ zzz’s, except for the random clamor of bullfrogs. lookin’ out over de water, the first thing you’d peep is a dull line—that’s de woods on de other side; you couldn’t suss much else; then a pale patch in de sky, then more paleness spreadin’ out; de river softened too, switchin’ from black to gray; you’d spot tiny dark specks driftin’ on de horizon—trading scows and whatnot—and long black streaks that were rafts; sometimes you’d catch a sweep screeching, or hear jumbled voices echo from far off; and then, eventually, you’d see a streak on de water that tells you there’s a snag in a swift current breakin’ on it, creatin’ that look; then de mist would curl off de water, de east would redden up, and you’d make out a log cabin at de edge of de woods on de far bank—probably a woodyard piled high by some shady cheats so you could toss a dog through it anywhere; then a sweet breeze would pop up, fanning you over from de other side, so cool, fresh, and mad sweet ‘cause of de woods and flowers—though sometimes it stank ‘cause dead fish and gars were left layin’ around, gettin’ pretty rank; and then de full day hit, with everything lit up, smilin’ in de sun while the songbirds kept their jams goin’.

there wasn’t even a wisp of smoke, so we’d snag some fish off our lines and whip up a hot breakfast. afterwards, we’d just vibe and watch de lonely river, chillin’ until we eventually crashed. wakin’ up later, we’d scope out de scene—maybe catch a steamboat coughin’ its way upstream, so far on de other side you couldn’t really tell if it was stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour, it was just pure solitude. next, you’d spot a raft glidin’ by far off, maybe with a dude on it hackin’ away—’cause that’s de usual raft life; you’d see an axe flash and drop—you wouldn’t even hear it—and then, as that axe swung back up, you’d finally hear a big ol’ k’chunk! that sound took all de time to travel over de water. so we coasted through de day, maxin’ out and listenin’ to de stillness. one time, de fog got so thick, and de rafts and whatever slid by bangin’ tin pans so steamboats wouldn’t run into ‘em. one scow or raft passed so close we could hear them talk, curse, and laugh—plain as day—even though we couldn’t spot 'em; it gave you major creeps, like spirits were floatin’ in de air. jim was like, "i reckon it’s spirits," but i was like, "nah; spirits wouldn’t be sayin’, 'dern the dern fog.'"

as soon as night hit, we bounced; once we got de raft out to roughly de middle, we chilled, lettin’ it drift wherever de current took it. then we fired up our pipes, dangled our legs in de water, and jammed on about all sorts of wild topics—we were always streakin’ day and night if de mosquitoes didn’t be wreckin’ our vibe. the fresh threads buck’s fam made for me were too lit to be comfy anyway, and i’ve never been much about clothes.

sometimes, we had de entire river all to ourselves for what felt like forever. out yonder were de banks and islands on de far side, and sometimes you’d catch a little spark—a candle glow in a cabin window; and sometimes, on de water, you could spot a spark or two—on a raft or a scow—and maybe even hear a fiddle or a tune driftin’ from one of de crafts. livin’ on a raft is straight-up bliss. we had de whole sky above, speckled with stars, and we’d just lie back and debate whether they were handcrafted or just happened. jim was all, "they were made," but i was like, "nah, they just happened"—‘cause, seriously, it’d take forever to make that many. jim even said de moon coulda laid ‘em; that sounded kinda on point, ‘cause i’ve seen a frog lay nearly as many, so why not? we even watched de fallin’ stars streak down—jim swore they got wrecked and bailed outta de nest.

once or twice a night, we’d peep a steamboat glidin’ through de dark, and every now and then, it’d belch a shower of sparks from its smokestacks, rainin’ down on de river like pure art; then it’d round a corner, its lights winking out and its whole vibe droppin’, leavin’ de river dead silent again; and later, its waves would hit us long after it was gone, givin’ our raft a little jiggle, then silence would reign for who knows how long—maybe only interrupted by some croakin’ frogs.

after midnight, de folks on shore crashed, and for a solid two or three hours, de banks were pitch black—no more cabin-window sparks. those sparks were our clock; when de first one popped back up, it meant dawn was close, so we scouted a spot to hide and tie up ASAP.

one morning ‘round daybreak, i spotted a canoe and crossed over a chute to de main shore—only like two hundred yards—and paddled about a mile up a crick through cypress woods to snag some berries. as i cruised past a spot where a cowpath crossed de crick, outta nowhere a couple of dudes came tearin’ up de path, full send. i thought i was done for—‘cause whenever someone was chasin’ someone, i figured it was me or maybe jim. i was about to dip real quick, but they got so close they started yellin’ and beggin’ me to save their lives—swearin’ they hadn’t done nothin’ and were bein’ chased by dudes and dogs. they were ready to jump in, but i was like, "don’t do it. i ain’t hearin’ no dogs or hooves yet; you got time to hustle through de brush, get up de crick a bit, then hit de water, wade on over to me, and jump in—that’ll totally throw de dogs off de scent."

they did as i said, and as soon as they were aboard, i high-tailed it for our tow-head. in about five or ten minutes, we could hear de dogs and dudes hollerin’ off in de distance. we heard ‘em creepin’ toward de crick, but couldn’t see a damn thing; they messed around for a while, and as we got further away, we barely heard ‘em at all. by the time we left a mile of woods behind and hit de river proper, it was dead silent, so we paddled over to de tow-head, bunked in de cottonwoods, and were safe.

one of these dudes was like seventy or more, rockin’ a bald dome with mad gray whiskers. he had on a beat-up slouch hat, a greasy blue wool shirt, and ragged blue jean britches tucked into his boot-tops, plus a homemade gallus—nah, just one—and an old long-tailed blue jean coat with slick brass buttons draped over his arm. both he and his partner lugged around huge, fat, ratty carpet-bags. the other dude was about thirty, dressed all ornery. after breakfast, we all chilled and started chattin’, and the first thing that came up was that these guys didn’t even know each other.

"what got you into this mess?" the baldhead asks de other chap.

yo, so here’s the tea: i was hustlin’ this miracle gadget that scrapes off that nasty tartar from your chompers—and yeah, it even yeets the enamel too, no cap—but i ended up crashing for an extra night than i should’ve and was just about to dip when i bumped into you on the trail on this side of town. you dropped the bomb that they were coming in hot and straight-up begged for my help to bounce. so i was like, “ngl, i was already expecting mad drama, so imma split with you.” that’s the full deets—what’s your story?

so check it: i was running this hype temperance revival gig for about a week, and i was literally the fave among all the ladies—big and small—‘cause i was turning up the heat for the rummies, raking in like five or six bucks a night (ten cents a head, kiddos and nay nays free), and biz was boomin’ nonstop. then, outta nowhere, word got around last night that i had this sneaky habit of clocking in some private jug time on the low. a nay nay straight-up woke me this morning and said the squad was lowkey gathering with their dogs and horses, and they’d roll through in about half an hour to run me down—and if they caught me they’d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, for real. so i bailed on breakfast—i wasn’t even hungry, no cap.

“yo, old man,” the youngin piped up, “imma bet we could squad up on this hustle together; what’s your take?”

i ain’t shut down on that, my guy. so, what’s your main hustle?

“i’m a jour printer by trade, dippin’ into patent meds on the side; a theater actor, rockin’ those tragic vibes, ya know; i also dabble in mesmerism and phrenology whenever the chance pops off; i even school kids in singing-geography sometimes; and i might drop a lecture every now and then—i do a million things, so none of it feels like work. what’s your gig?”

“man, i’ve done a solid amount of doctoring in my day. laying on o’ hands is my signature move—i can smack down cancer and freeze paralysis like it’s nothing—and i can read a fortune pretty slick when i’ve got someone to spill the tea for me. i’m big on preachin’ too, doin’ camp meet-ups and goin’ on full missionary mode.”

there was dead silence for a minute; then the young buck let out a long, dramatic sigh and goes:

“alas!”

“what are you even whining about?” says the baldhead.

“i can’t even with it—i mean, who’d have thought i’d end up livin’ this cray life and get dragged down to roll with this squad?” he grumbled, wiping the corner of his eye with a rag.

“seriously, bro, your vibe—ain’t this crew lit enough for you?” snaps the baldhead, all pert and uppish.

“yeah, it’s as lit as i deserve; i dragged myself down from those high heights. i ain’t throwing no shade at you dudes—nah, i ain’t blaming anyone. i earned every bit of this mess. let the cold, hard world do its worst; one thing’s for sure—there’s a grave waitin’ for my sorry self. the world may snatch away all the good stuff—friends, cash, everything—but it can’t steal that one thing. someday, i’ll just lie down in it, forget it all, and my shattered heart can finally catch a break.” he kept on wiping.

“bro, ease up on that busted heart,” says the baldhead, “why you spillin’ your raw feels all over us? we didn’t do nothin’, ya feel?”

“nah, i know you’re clean. i only dragged myself down—i did it all on my own. i deserve every bit of the pain, and i ain’t even moanin’ about it.”

“but yo, brought yourself down from where, exactly?”

“ah, you wouldn’t believe it; the world never vibes with the truth anyway—let it slide, it ain’t no biggie. the secret of my birth—”

“your birth secret? are you actually sayin’—”

“yo, gentlemen,” says the youngin, all solemn and intense, “i’m droppin’ this secret on y’all ‘cause i trust you. ngl, by legit right, i’m a duke!”

jim’s eyeballs went full glitch mode when he caught that—and i swear mine did too. then the baldhead goes, “no way! you can’t be serious?”

“facts. my great-grandpops—the eldest son of the duke of bridgewater—dipped out to this land near the end of the last century to breathe in that pure freedom vibe; he got hitched here and then passed, leavin’ behind a son (with his own dad dying around the same time). but then the second son of the late duke snatched up all the titles and estates, totally ghostin’ the legit infant duke. i’m the straight-up descendant of that baby duke—i’m the rightful duke of bridgewater; and here i am, abandoned, torn from that high-roller life, hunted by every lowlife, dissed by a cold, heartless world, lookin’ like a total wreck, and forced to kick it with a bunch of shady outlaws on a damn raft!”

jim was hella feelin’ him, and so was i. we tried to hype him up, but he was like, “nah, nothing will fix this mess except if i just peace out for good;” though he did admit it vibes him up a bit if folks treat him like royalty—gettin’ down on one knee, droppin’ a “your grace” or “my lord” when they speak, servin’ him first at meals, and never sittin’ down until he gives the nod. so jim and i got busy majestying him, runnin’ around doin’ this and that and stayin’ up until he said we could sit. that totally lifted his spirit, and he got way more upbeat and chill. but the duke started gettin’ salty at him and wasn’t feelin’ how things were goin’, while the king kept it super friendly, sayin’ that the duke’s great-grandpops and all the other dukes of bilgewater were mad respected by his dad and got major palace props; still, the duke remained in a huffy mood for a hot minute, until eventually the king said:

“like, for real, we gotta stick together for a long haul on this hella cramped raft, bilgewater, so why you trippin’ with all that sour energy? it’ll just make the vibes extra awkward. it ain’t on me that i wasn’t born a duke, and it ain’t on you that you weren’t born a king—so why sweat it? just roll with what you got, that’s my motto. we hit a pretty chill spot here—plenty of grub and an easy life—so c’mon, hook us up, duke, and let’s squad up as fam.”

the duke came through, and jim and i were mega stoked to see that. it killed all the awkward vibes and we felt hella good, ‘cause on a raft, any bad energy is a total disaster—the only thing you need is everyone chillin’ and vibin’ together.

i didn’t take long to peep that these clowns weren’t real kings or dukes at all—they were just low-down frauds and humbugs. but i kept it all on the down low and never threw shade; that’s the best way to avoid beef and drama. if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, cool with me, as long as it kept the peace; and there was zero point in spilling it to jim, so i zipped my lip. if i learned anything from pap, it was that the slickest way to roll with these types is to let them do their own thing.

chapter xx.

they fired off a ton of questions, all like, “why you decking out the raft like that and chillin’ in the daytime instead of bouncin’—was jim a runaway nay nay?” 

bro, come on, would a runaway nay nay even roll down south?

nah, they were straight-up like, “no way.” i had to spin a tale, so i said:

“my fam was chillin’ in pike county, missouri—where i popped into this world—and everyone died except me, pa, and my bro ike. pa had planned to split and bounce to live with uncle ben, who’s rockin’ a one-horse crib on the river, like forty-four miles down from orleans. pa was hella broke and had mad debts; so when he squared things up over there, all we got was sixteen bucks and our nay nay, jim. sixteen bucks wasn’t enough to take us on a fourteen-hundred-mile cruise—not by deck passage or any other way. but then, when the river started risin’, pa got lucky one day; he snagged some random piece of a raft, so we figured we’d ride it down to orleans. turns out, pa’s luck totally tanked—a steamboat crushed the forward corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard, plunging under the wheel; jim and i surfaced okay, but pa was wasted, and little ike was only four, so they never saw him again. for the next day or two, we had mad drama, cuz folks kept showin’ up in skiffs tryin’ to snatch jim away, claimin’ he was a runaway nay nay. now, we don’t roll by day; they leave us alone at night.”

the duke chimed in, “leave me alone to cook up a plan so we can dip in the daylight if we want. i’ll crunch some thoughts and whip up a fix. we’ll let it ride for today, ‘cause obviously we don’t wanna cruise past that town in the sun—it might bring some toxic vibes.”

as night crept in, the skies got dark and started lookin’ rainy; heat lightning was flexin’ low in the sky and even the leaves were shivering—it was gonna be a hot mess, no lie. so the duke and the king bounced over to check out our wigwam, scopin’ the beds. my bed was a straw upgrade compared to jim’s corny corn-shuck bed—those shuck beds always come with rogue cobs that poke you and hurt like crazy; and when you roll over, the dry shucks rustle like a pile of dead leaves, loud enough to wake you up. the duke was like, “i’ll take your bed,” but the king shot back, “nah, i ain’t down with that.” he goes:

“i figured the rank diff means a corn-shuck bed just ain’t fit for a royal like me. your grace, snag that shuck bed yourself.”

jim and i got hella anxious for a minute, worryin’ more drama was comin’ between them; so we were super relieved when the duke said:

“’tis my fate to be forever mashed into the grime under the iron heel of oppression. misfortune has totally smashed my once high-key spirit; i yield, i submit—this is my lot. i’m all alone in this world—let me take the heat, i got this.”

we dipped as soon as it got dark and solid. the king ordered us to stick out toward the middle of the river and keep our light on lockdown until we cruised way past the town. soon enough, we spotted a little cluster of lights—that was the town—and slid by, about a half mile out. once we were three-quarters of a mile past, we hoisted up our signal lantern; and around ten o’clock, the sky went berserk—rain, wind, thunder, lightning, the whole nine yards. the king told us to keep watch until the storm eased up; then he and the duke crawled into the wigwam to crash for the night. it was my watch till midnight, but i wouldn’t have crashed even if i had a bed, ‘cause no one sees a storm like that every week, trust. damn, the wind was literally screaming! every couple seconds, a flicker would zap, lighting the whitecaps for half a mile, making the islands look dusty through the rain, and the trees were flailing like they were in a mosh pit; then bam—whack! bum! bumble, um, bam-bam-bam—and the thunder rumbled then died, only to come back with another crazy flash and hit. the waves even tossed me off the raft sometimes, but i had no threads on, so i was chill. and we didn’t even sweat over snags; the lightning was bouncing around so much that we could dodge any obstacles by flickin’ the raft this way or that.

i was on the middle watch, but i was dead sleepy, so jim covered the first half—he’s always been dope like that. i crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled everywhere, leaving me with no spot; so i ended up chillin’ outside. i didn’t mind the rain, ‘cause it was warm and the waves weren’t too bossy then. around two, jim was about to call me, but he switched it up, thinkin’ the waves were too weak to harm; but damn, i was caught off guard when a massive surge came outta nowhere and tossed me overboard. jim almost died laughin’—he was the easiest nay nay to crack up, no cap.

i grabbed the rest of the watch while jim crashed and started snorin’. eventually, the storm dipped for real, and the moment a cabin-light popped up, i hauled him out and we slid the raft into a secret hideout for the day.

after breakfast, the king whipped out an old, ratty deck of cards, and he and the duke played seven-up for a hot minute—five cents a game. then they got bored and decided to “lay out a campaign,” as they called it. the duke dove into his carpet-bag and pulled out a stack of printed bills, readin’ ‘em loud. one bill said, “the celebrated dr. armand de montalban, of paris,” was gonna “lecture on the science of phrenology” at such-and-such a spot on a certain day, charging ten cents at the door, and “dishing out character charts for twenty-five cents a pop.” the duke claimed that was him. in another bill, he was billed as the “world-renowned shakespearian tragedian, garrick the younger, of drury lane, london.” on other bills, he rocked a bunch of names and bragged about epic feats like findin’ water and gold with a “divining-rod” and “dissipatin’ witch spells,” and more. eventually he goes:

“but yo, the histrionic muse is the real bae. have you ever hit the stage, royalty?”

“nah,” says the king.

“then you will, before you hit three extra days, fallen grandeur,” says the duke. “the first legit town we roll into, we’re gonna rent a hall and throw down a swordfight scene from richard iii, and then smash out the balcony scene from romeo and juliet. how’s that vibe?”

“i’m down, to the max, for anything that pays, bilgewater; but, like, i don’t know squat about actin’ and never really peeped much of it. i was just a mini when pap had ‘em at the palace. think you can school me?”

“easy!”

“aight. i’m just hella bored and in need of something fresh anyway. let’s kick this off right now.”

so the duke broke it all down—who romeo was and who juliet was—and said he was so used to rockin’ romeo that the king could totally be juliet.

“but if juliet’s that young, duke, my bald dome and white whiskers might look hella extra on her, maybe.”

“nah, don’t trip; these country dudes won’t even clock that. plus, you’ll be in full costume, which makes all the difference; juliet’s chillin’ in a balcony, soaking in the moonlight before she crashes, rockin’ her nightgown and a ruffled nightcap. here, peep the outfits for the roles.”

the duke whipped out two or three curtain-calico suits, claimin’ they were meedyevil armor for richard iii. (and the other part, too) plus a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. the king was down with it; so the duke pulled out his book and went ham, readin’ the lines in the most over-the-top, spread-eagle style—prancin’ around and actin’ it out to show how it was gonna go down—then passed the book to the king and told him to memorize his part.

there was this tiny one-horse town like three miles down the bend, and after dinner the duke was like, “yo, i mapped out a plan so we can cruise in the daylight without any major hazards for jim.” so he said he’d bounce to the town to lock that plan in. the king was like, “i’m in too,” to see if he could snag some ideas. we were all out of coffee, so jim was like, “yo, you better jump in the canoe with us and score some caffeine.”

when we rolled into town, there was zero action; the streets were empty, dead quiet—like a chill sunday. we ran into a sick nay nay catchin’ rays in a backyard, and he was like, “yo, everyone who isn’t too young, too sick, or too old bounced to a camp meeting about two miles back in the woods.” the king snagged the directions and said he’d roll up and run that camp meeting to the max, and i could tag along.

the duke dropped that he was after a printing-office. we scoped one out—a tiny joint above a carpenter shop (since the carpenters and printers all dipped for the meeting, leaving the doors unlocked). the place was mad messy, covered in ink stains and plastered with flyers showin’ horses and runaway nay nays all over the walls. the duke tossed off his coat and was like, “i’m all good now.” so the king and i bounced over to the camp meeting.

we got there in like half an hour, soaked to the bone ‘cause it was a blazing hot day. there were, like, a thousand people from twenty miles around. the woods were packed with teams and wagons everywhere, munchin’ straight outta wagon troughs and stompin’ to shake off the flies. there were makeshift sheds built from poles and branches, sellin’ lemonade, gingerbread, and stacks of watermelons, green corn, and all that truck.

the preachin’ was poppin’ off under similar sheds—only bigger—to host massive crowds. the benches were made of rough-hewn log slabs with holes drilled on the sides for legs (no backs, nada). the preachers stood on high platforms at one end of the sheds. the women rocked sun-bonnets; some sported linsey-woolsey frocks, some rocked gingham, and a few young ones had on calico. some of the young men were barefoot, and some kiddos only had a tow-linen shirt on. a few old ladies were knittin’, while some of the young ones were lowkey flirtin’ on the down-low.

the first shed we hit, the preacher was out here droppin’ a fire hymn. he belted out two dope lines, and the whole squad was vibin’ hard, no cap—it was lit hearin’ so many peeps join in, all rallyin’ in mad hype; then he dropped another two lines for the crew to blast out—and the flow kept goin’.

the crowd got more woke by the minute, singin’ louder and louder; and as things escalated, some folks started groanin’ while others started hollerin’.

then our dude preacher kicked into full sermon mode, no joke; he was weavin’ all over the platform—first to one side, then the other, then leanin’ down over the front—with his whole body in constant motion, shoutin’ his gospel like he was livestreamin’ his soul. every now and then he’d hoist up his bible, flip it open like a prized playlist, and pass it around like it was the ultimate remix, yellin’, “it’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! look upon it and live!” 

and the peeps would roar back, “glory!—a-a-men!” as he kept goin’, while the crowd kept groanin’, cryin’, and shoutin’ amen like it was the hottest drop of the year:

“oh, slide up to the mourners’ bench! slide, you’re drippin’ with sin! (amen!)
slide, you’re all sick and sore! (amen!)
slide, you’re lame, busted, and blind! (amen!)
slide, you’re broke and needy, drownin’ in shame! (a-a-men!)
slide, all you worn, soiled, and hurt souls—come with a broken vibe!
slide with that lowkey spirit! roll in with your rags, sins, and grime!
the free cleanse waters are on deck, the door to heaven is wide open—oh, step in and chill!” (a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!)

and so on. you couldn’t peep a word of the preacher ‘cause the shoutin’ and cryin’ was off the charts. folks busted up all over the place, hustlin’ with pure grind energy to reach the mourners’ bench, tears runnin’ down like waterfalls; and when every single soul gathered up front, they sang, screamed, and flung themselves down on the straw, straight-up wild and chaotic.

so, first off, i peeped that the king was already kickin’ things off, his voice boomin’ over the rest; then he charged up on the platform, and the preacher was like, “yo, drop some words for the squad,” and the king did his thing.

he declared he was a legit pirate—had been pillagin’ the indian ocean for like thirty years—and his crew got thinned out major last spring in a wild fight. now he’s back on home turf lookin’ to recruit fresh blood, and lowkey, he was hyped ‘cause he got jacked off a steamboat last night, left with not a dime, and he was straight-up grateful; it was the dopest blessing ever, ‘cause he was a changed man now, finally happy af. even though he was broke as heck, he was ready to hustle his way back to the indian ocean, spendin’ the rest of his life tryna flip those pirates onto the righteous grind; 'cause yo, he knew every pirate crew out there better than anyone else; and even if it meant a long, no-cash journey, he’d make it happen—every time he convinced a pirate, he’d be like, “don’t thank me, don’t give me that credit; it’s all for those dear peeps at the pokeville camp-meeting, our natural fam and true benefactors—and that real-deal preacher over there, the truest friend a pirate could ever have!”

then he busted into tears, and soon enough, everybody joined in. then someone hollered, “yo, collect a stash for him, collect a stash!” like half a dozen jumped in immediately, but then someone else was like, “nah, let him pass his hat around!” and soon the whole squad—preacher included—was chanting that.

so the king swaggered through the crowd with his hat dabbin’ his eyes, blessin’ and praising everyone for bein’ so cool to the poor pirate homies down the river; and every so often, the flyest girls, tears streamin’ down their cheeks, would roll up askin’ if they could plant a kiss on him to remember the moment; and he was always game—huggin’ and kissin’ some up to five or six times—and even got invited to crash for a week; everyone wanted him to move in with ’em and called it an honor; but he was like, “nah, it’s the last day of the camp-meeting, i can’t do any good here, plus i’m sweatin’ bullets to hit up the indian ocean and work on my pirate hustle.”

when we bounced back to the raft and did the count, he clocked eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents in the bag. plus, he had scored a three-gallon jug of whisky he found chillin’ under a wagon while headin’ home through the woods. the king was like, “take all this, fam—it tops any day i’ve ever spent on that missionary grind.” he was straight up sayin’ there’s no point in yappin’, ‘cause heathens don’t measure up to pirates when it comes to rockin’ a camp-meeting.

the duke was feelin’ like he’d been killin’ it until the king showed up, and then his vibe kinda dropped. he’d already printed two mini gigs for local farmers—horse bills—and pocketed four bucks from that. plus, he scooped up ten dollars’ worth of ads for the paper, sayin’ he’d put ‘em in for just four bucks if paid upfront—and they did. the paper normally cost two dollars a year, but he snagged three subs for fifty cents each on the promise of advance cash; the locals were gonna pay in cordwood and onions like usual, but he was like, “i just copped this biz and knocked the price down as low as i can swing, and now i’m runnin’ it for cash.” he even whipped up a little piece of poetry straight from his brain—three verses, kinda sweet and sad—the title bein’, “yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and left it queued up to print for free. in the end, he raked in nine dollars and a half and declared it a pretty square day’s hustle.

then he showed us another mini job he’d printed for free, just for our crew. it had a pic of a runaway nay nay with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” stamped underneath. the flyer was all about jim, layin’ out his deets to a tee: it said he bailed from st. jacques’ plantation, like, forty miles below new orleans last winter, and probably bounced up north—and whoever could nab him and ship him back would score the reward plus expenses.

“now,” the duke declares, “after tonight we can flex and run in the daylight if we feel like it. anytime we spot someone comin’, we can rope jim up, tie him hand and foot, dump him in the wigwam, flash this flyer, and say we caught him up the river ‘cause we were too broke for a steamboat, so we had to grab this tiny raft on credit from our crew to chase that reward. sure, handcuffs and chains would give jim a next-level look, but that just wouldn’t jive with our broke aesthetic—way too extra. ropes, my friends—we gotta keep it 100, as we always say on the boards.”

we all were like, the duke’s mad smart, and runnin’ in the daylight wouldn’t be no issue. we figured we could clock enough miles that night to bounce outta the heat the duke’s printing hustle was about to stir up in that tiny town; and then we could boom on the move if we wanted to.

we kept it lowkey and stayed still, not poppin’ off until nearly ten o’clock; then we slid past, keepin’ mad distance from town, and didn’t hoist our lantern until we were way out of its insta-reach.

when jim hit me up at four in the morning to take the watch, he was like:
“huck, u think we finna run into any mo’ kings on this trip?”
“no,” i replied, “i reckon not.”
“well,” he goes, “that’s cool then. i ain’t about one or two kings, but that’s plenty. this dude’s a hardcore drunk, and the duke ain’t any better.”

i noticed jim had been tryna get him to spit some french, just to vibe with it; but he was like, “i’ve been in this country so long and been through so much, i straight-up forgot it.”

chapter xxi.

it was past sun-up now, but we kept it movin’ and didn’t even dock. the king and the duke soon came off lookin’ hella rusty; but once they jumped overboard and took a chill swim, it totally refreshed their vibe.

after breakfast, the king plopped himself on the corner of the raft, kicked off his boots, rolled up his britches, and let his legs hang loose in the water for max comfort, lit his pipe, and started gettin’ his romeo and juliet by heart. once he nailed it, he and the duke started practicin’ it together.

the duke had to school him over and over on droppin’ every line—makin’ him sigh and slap his hand on his heart—until he finally said he’d got it down; “only,” he goes, “you gotta not holler out romeo like a mad bull—you gotta drop it soft and emo, so—r-o-o-meo! that’s the vibe; 'cause juliet is like a sweet, pure little girl, and she ain’t tryna bray like a jackass.”

next, they whipped out a couple of long swords the duke crafted out of oak slats and kicked off a mock swordfight—the duke even dubbed himself richard iii.—and their prancing antics on the raft were straight-up epic. but soon enough, the king tripped and took a spill overboard, and after that they chilled and dished about all kinds of wild adventures from back in the day along the river.

after dinner, the duke goes:
“yo, capet, we gotta level up this show real hard, so i guess imma add a lil’ extra to it. we need something fire for those encores anyway.”

“what’s onkores, bilgewater?”

the duke clued him in, then said:
“i’m gonna hit back with either the highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe; and you—hold up—oh, i got it—you can drop hamlet’s soliloquy.”

“hamlet’s which?”

“hamlet’s soliloquy, fam; the most legendary drop in shakespeare. ah, it’s sublime, sublime! always pulls in the crowd. i don’t have it in a book—i only got one volume—but i bet i can piece it together from memory. lemme just pace a minute and see if i can flex it back from the vaults.”

so he started pacing up and down, deep in thought and frowning hardcore every now and then; then he’d lift his eyebrows, slam his hand on his forehead, stagger back and let out a moan; then a big sigh, and eventually a tear would roll down. it was mad beautiful. before long, he totally nailed it. he told us, “pay attention, squad.” then he hit a majestic stance—one leg forward, arms stretched out, head tilted back like he was checkin’ the skies; and then he began ripping into his speech, gritting his teeth, howling and flexin’ his chest like he was untouchable. honestly, he smacked down any performance i’d ever peeped. this is the speech—I copped it on the fly while he was schoolin’ it to the king:

to be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin  
that turns a long life into a total trash show;  
for who would shoulder heavy side quests, until birnam wood storms through dunsinane,  
if not for the pure terror of the after-sleep,  
that straight-up wrecks our chill vibe,  
nature’s unexpected second course,  
and makes us wanna sling wild arrows at outrageous fortune  
rather than jump into unknown hustles.  
yo, that’s the moment that makes you pause:  
knock duncan awake with your epic knockin’!  
i wish you could;  
‘cause who would handle the whips and savage burns of time,  
the oppressor’s lowkey wrongs, the proud dude’s brutal clapbacks,  
the slow-mo of the law, and the final reset that his pain might deliver?  
in the dead of night, when graveyards flex in their usual gloomy black,  
only ’cause that undiscovered country—where no traveler ever bounces back—  
spreads toxic vibes all over the world,  
and so the natural glow of our resolve, like that poor cat in the old adage,  
gets totally overcast with stress.  
and all the clouds that hover over our hood,  
their vibes go totally off-course,  
and lose any claim to action.  
it’s a finish that’s high-key worth the hype.  
but yo, chill, fair ophelia:  
don’t go openin’ up your chunky, marble jaws.  
get yourself to a nunnery—bounce!

well, the old dude was totally vibin’ with that speech, and before long he mastered it so he could drop it like a boss. it was like he was born for this; and when he got hyped, it was pure gold watchin’ him rip, tear, and go all in—a performance for the ages.

the first chance we snagged, the duke printed some show bills; and for two or three days as we floated along, the raft turned into the dopest stage ever, non-stop sword fights and rehearsals (as the duke called it).

one morning, as we cruised down arkansaw, we peeped a tiny one-horse town chillin’ in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, at the mouth of a creek squeezed tight like a tunnel by cypress trees, and everyone except jim grabbed the canoe and paddled down to scope out if that spot had any potential for our show.

we struck it hella lucky; there was a circus poppin’ off that afternoon, and the locals were already rollin’ in in all kinds of rickety wagons and on horses. the circus was gonna dip before night, so our show had mad potential.

the duke booked the courthouse, and we went around plasterin’ our flyers. they read like this:

shaksperean revival!!! wonderful attraction! for one night only! the world renowned tragedians, david garrick the younger, of drury lane theatre, london, and edmund kean the elder, of the royal haymarket theatre, whitechapel, pudding lane, piccadilly, london, and the royal continental theatres, in their sublime shaksperean spectacle entitled the balcony scene in romeo and juliet!!!

admission 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents.

then we went loafin’ around town. the shops and houses were all these old, creaky, dried-up wooden frames that never got a fresh coat; they sat like three or four feet above ground on stilts so they wouldn’t get swampy when the river went cray. the houses had tiny gardens, but they barely grew anything except jimpson weeds, sunflowers, piles of ash, old curled-up boots and shoes, bits of bottle, rags, and busted tin-ware. the fences were a mishmash of boards, nailed on at random times; leaning every which-way, with gates that typically had just one hinge—a leather one. some of the fences had been whitewashed back in clumbus’s day, and there were usually hogs roaming the gardens, with folks constantly shooing them out.

all the shops lined one street. they rocked white domestic awnings in front, and the locals hitched their horses to the awning posts. there were empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers chillin’ on them all day long, whittlin’ at them with their barlow knives; chompin’ on tobacco, gaping, yawning, and stretchin’—a seriously ornery bunch. they usually rocked yellow straw hats as wide as umbrellas, but never wore coats or waistcoats; they’d holler at each other with names like bill, buck, hank, joe, and andy, chattin’ all lazy and drawn-out, droppin’ a mad stack of cuss words. it was like there was one loafer loungin’ by every awning-post, always with his hands in his britches pockets—unless he pulled ‘em out to share a chaw of tobacco or scratch an itch. and all you’d hear from them was:

“gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, hank.”

“cain’t; i hain’t got but one chaw left. ask bill.”

maybe bill gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got none. some of these loafers never have a single cent or even a chaw of their own. they always borrow; they’re like, “i wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, jack, i jist passed the last chaw i had to ben thompson”—which is a straight-up lie nearly every time; it only fools a total stranger, but jack ain’t no stranger, so he fires back:

“you give him a chaw, did you? so did your sister’s cat’s grandmother. you pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me, lafe buckner, then i’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”

“well, i did pay you back some of it wunst.”

“yes, you did—’bout six chaws. you borry’d store tobacker and paid back nay nay-head.”

store tobacco is like a flat black plug, but these dudes mostly chow down on natural leaf all twisted up. when they borrow a chaw, they don’t normally slice it off with a knife—they just wedge the plug between their teeth, gnaw at it and tug with their hands until it splits in two; then sometimes the owner gets all mournful when it’s handed back and goes all sarcastic:

“here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”

all the streets and lanes were nothing but mud—mud as black as tar, about a foot deep in some spots and a couple of inches deep elsewhere. the hogs chilled and grunted everywhere. you’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs ambling along the street, just plopping right in the path so that folks had to swerve around her. she’d stretch out, shut her eyes, flick her ears while the pigs were milking her vibe, lookin’ as happy as if she was gettin’ paid. and before long, a loafer would holler, “yo! hey boy! get ‘em, tige!” and off would dash the sow, squealin’ madly, with a dog or two jamming by each ear and three or four dozen more comin’; then all the loafers would rise up, watch the chaos outta sight, laugh their heads off, and be mad grateful for the noise. then they’d chill again until a dog fight broke out. nothing could wake ‘em or hype ‘em like a dog fight—unless someone dripped turpentine on a stray dog and lit him up, or tied a tin pan to his tail and watched him run himself to death.

on the riverfront, some houses were literally leanin’ over the bank, all bowed and bent, like ready to tumble in any sec. the folks had already bounced from ‘em. one corner of some houses had caved in, leaving that bit hangin’ over dangerously. some people still stuck around, but it was mad risky, ‘cause sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in all at once. sometimes a whole belt of land a quarter of a mile deep starts snugglin’ in and caves in bit by bit until the whole thing drops into the river in one summer. a town like that’s gotta keep movin’ back, and back, and back, ‘cause the river’s always gnawin’ at it.

as noon rolled in that day, the streets got hella packed with wagons and horses, with more comin’ all the time. families lugged their dinners from the boondocks and munched ‘em in their wagons. there was serious whisky flowin’, and i peeped three fights. before long, someone belted out:

“here comes old boggs!—back from the sticks for his monthly booze run; here he comes, boys!”

all the loafers got hyped; i figured they were all too used to turnin’ old boggs into a party. one of ‘em said:

“wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. if he’d a-chawed up all the dudes he’s been a-gwyne to chow up over the last twenty years, he’d be a legit legend by now.”

another piped up, “i wisht old boggs’d threaten me, ’cuz then i’d know i ain’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”

boggs is comin’ in full throttle on his steed, whoopin’ and hollerin’ like he’s straight up channelin’ tribal vibes, and he drops this fire line:

“clear the lane, squad. i’m ridin’ the hype-path, and coffin prices are ‘bout to go sky-high.”

yo, he was mad wasted and swayin’ in his saddle; this dude was fifty-plus and his face was lit red like a busted filter. everyone in the street was hollerin’, crackin’ up, and throwin’ savage roasts at him, and he clapped back hard, promising to school ‘em one by one—but he wasn’t waitin’ around, ‘cause he rolled into town to off old colonel sherburn, with the motto, “meat first, then get spoon-fed the rest, no cap.”

he peeks me, rides up, and spits, “yo, where you comin’ from, kid? you ready to yeet?”

then he bounces off. i was shook, but some dude was like, “don’t sweat it—he’s always spittin’ this crazy stuff when he’s lit. he’s the chillest old goof in arkansas—never clapped anyone, sober or smashed.”

boggs rolls up by the dopest store in town, leans in low to peep under the awning, and bellows, “come out here, sherburn! step up and face the dude you straight-up played. you’re the one i’m chasin’, and i’m comin’ for you too—no cap!”

and so, he kept droppin’ every burn on sherburn his tongue could muster, with the whole street packed tight, listenin’ and crackin’ up. soon enough, this fly dude—lookin’ all proud and around fifty-five, the best dressed in town—steps out of the store, and the squad parts like it’s a viral filter just to let him through. he strolls over to boggs, all chill and deliberate, and goes:

“i’m over this drama, but i’ll stick it out till one o’clock. after one, listen up—if you throw any shade at me even once, you won’t get far. i’ll track you down, no cap.”

then he bounces back in. the crowd got hella quiet; not one peep or laugh left. boggs roars off, still spittin’ mad burn after burn at sherburn down the block; soon enough, he comes back and parks right in front of the store, still on a savage rant. a bunch of dudes crowded him, tryna get him to zip it, tellin’ him it’d be one o’clock in about fifteen minutes—time to dip, bro. but nah, he went off, cussin’ at full volume, flinging his hat in the mud and ridin’ right over it, then tearin’ down the block again with his gray hair flyin'. every single person who could catch him tried coaxing him off his ride so they could lock him up and sober him, but it was useless—up the street he tore again, unleashing another round of burns for sherburn. then, someone hollers, “go for his daughter! quick, go for his daughter; sometimes her word is the only one that lands with him. if anyone can shut him up, it’s her.”

so some dude takes off runnin’. i cruised down the street a bit and then parked myself. in like five or ten minutes, here comes boggs again—but not on his horse. he’s reelin’ across the street toward me, bare-headed, with two homies on either side clutchin’ his arms and hustlin’ him along. he’s quiet and lookin’ all uneasy; he ain’t hidin’ but is rushin’ along like he’s tryna outrun his own chaos. then someone shouts:

“boggs!”

i glance over and see that it’s colonel sherburn, standin’ dead still in the middle of the street with a pistol raised in his right hand—not aimmin’, just coolly pointin’ it skyward. the same sec, i peep a young girl sprintin’ over with two dudes in tow. boggs and his crew spin around to scope out who yelled, and when they see that piece, they dip to one side as the barrel lowers slow and steady—both barrels cocked right. boggs flings up his hands and goes, “o lord, don’t shoot!” bam! the first shot rings out, and he staggers back, clawin’ at thin air—bam! the second shot lands, and the dude goes sprawling to the ground, heavy and solid, arms flung out like he’s glitchin’. that young girl loses it, screamin’, rushin’ over and floppin’ herself on her dad, bawlin’ out, “oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!” the mob squeezes in, shovin’ and stretchin’ their necks to get a peek, with peeps inside yellin’, “back, back! give him space, give him space!”

colonel sherburn then casually tosses his piece to the ground, spins on his heel, and walks off like it’s all just a random flex.

they cart boggs off to a run-down drugstore, with the crowd still crushin’ around and the whole town followin’. i scrambled to snag the best spot by the window to get a prime view. they laid him on the floor, propped his head on one massive bible, and spread another one over his chest—but not before they ripped open his shirt, revealin’ exactly where that bullet hit. he drew in about a dozen long gasps, his chest heaving the bible skyward with each breath—and then he just went silent; he was done, dead. then they yanked his daughter away from him, screamin’ and cryin’, and whisked her off. she was around sixteen, sweet and gentle-looking, but mad pale and straight-up terrified.

real quick, the whole town showed up, wriggling and scramblin’, pushin’ and shovin’ to snag a look at the window, but those who had the prime spots wouldn’t budge, and peeps at the back kept goin’, “yo, you’ve peeped enough, fam; it ain’t right for you to hog the view—others deserve a shot too.”

there was mad chatter goin’ on, so i dipped out, thinkin’ trouble was on the horizon. the streets were packed and everyone was hyped. every witness of the shootout was spillin’ the deets, and a huge mob pressed in around each dude, stretchin’ their necks like it was a flex challenge to catch every angle. then this lanky dude, long-haired and rockin’ a giant white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and wieldin’ a crooked-handled cane, started markin’ the spots on the ground where boggs and sherburn had stood. the crew trailed him as he strolled, bobbin’ their heads like they were in sync, stoopin’ down and restin’ their hands on their thighs to watch him trace the spots with his cane; then he straightened up exactly where sherburn had been, hat brim draggin’ over his eyes, and boomed out, “boggs!” then he swung his cane down slow to eye-level and went, “bang!” staggin’ backwards, then “bang!” again, before finally slumping flat on his back. the onlookers were like, “bruh, he nailed it—exactly how it all went down.” then about a dozen peeps whipped out their bottles and started treatin’ him like the performance of the century.

soon enough, some homie dropped the idea that sherburn should be lynched. within minutes, the entire mob was shoutin’ it out, wild and yellin’, snatchin’ every clothesline they could find to hang him up proper.

chapter xxii.

they swarmed up to sherburn’s crib, going off like a pack of savage tribes, yellin’ and rampagin’, makin’ way or gettin’ flattened to mush—it was a brutal sight. even the kids were leadin’ the charge, screamin’ and dodgin’ outta harm’s way; every window along the road was jammed with women peepin’ out, and there were nay nay boys chillin’ in every tree, with dudes and ladies leanin’ over every fence; and just when the mob got close, those on watch would scatter right back before gettin’ caught.

a ton of the women and girls were bawlin’ and trippin’, scared out of their minds.

they piled up in front of sherburn’s palings as densely as possible, the noise so crazy you couldn’t even hear your own thoughts. the whole space was like a tight twenty-foot yard. someone started hollerin’, “tear down the fence! tear down the fence!” and then chaos erupted—ripping, tearin’, smashing—and the front wall of the crowd began rollin’ in like one massive wave.

just then, sherburn steps onto the roof of his little front porch, clutchin’ a double-barrel piece, and stands there all chill and deliberate, not sayin’ a word. instantly, the racket died down, and the wave of people sucked back like they just failed a vibe check.

sherburn stayed iced out, just starin’ down at the mob. the silence was hella creepy and uncomfortable. he slowly scanned the crowd, and every time his gaze hit someone, they tried to stare him down—but couldn’t, so they dropped their eyes like they were caught slippin’. then, outta nowhere, sherburn let out this laugh—not the chill, feel-good kind, but one that felt like biting into bread loaded with sand.

then he goes, slow and scornful:

“yo, the idea of you mobbin’ and lynchin’ someone is straight-up hilarious, no cap. the notion that you think you got enough guts to off a dude is peak cringe. like, you’re wild enough to tar and feather those lonely, outcast chicks that wander by—did that puff you up enough to think you could take down a real man? bruh, a man’s safe as long as there’s like ten thousand of your type around him—as long as it’s day and you ain’t lurkin’ in his shadow.

“do i know you? i know you full-on, fam. i grew up in the south and chilled in the north too, so i got the full tea on the average dude. truth is, most men are total cowards. up north, they let anyone walk all over ‘em and go home prayin’ for a humble spirit; while down south, one dude alone can stop a whole stagecoach crew in daylight and rob ‘em all. your papers call you brave so much that you think you’re the real deal—when really, you’re just as basic as everyone else.

“why don’t your juries hang murderers? ‘cause they’re shook, scared that the victim’s crew will come and blast ‘em in the dark—and that’s exactly what they’d do.

“so they always let these guys slide; then at night, a man sneaks out with a hundred masked wimps and lynches the villain. your epic fail is that you rolled up without a true man; that’s one major mistake—and on top of that, you didn’t come in the dark with your masks. you only brought half a man—buck harkness, over there—and if you hadn’t started with him, you’d have blown the guy away, period.

“look, you never really wanted this mess. the average dude don’t like trouble or danger—and neither do you. but if even half a man—like buck harkness—yells ‘lynch him! lynch him!’ you get so scared you can’t back down, afraid you’ll be exposed as the coward you are, so you cling to that half-man’s vibe, comin’ up here and swearin’ big promises. a mob is the most pathetic thing out there; it’s just a rag-tag army that borrows its courage from the mass hype and its leaders. but a mob without a real man at the helm? that’s the epitome of pitiful. so here’s what you do: drop your tail, bounce back home, and crawl into a hole. if any real lynching is ever gonna go down, it’ll be done in the dark, southern style—when they roll in with their masks and bring a true man. now bounce—and take your half-man with you.”

– he chucks his piece across his left arm and cocks it while droppin’ that truth bomb.

the mob split like, whoa, and then scattered in every direction—and buck harkness trailed after them, lookin’ lowkey pathetic. i could’ve stayed to peep more, but nah, i wasn’t feelin’ it.

i bounced over to the circus and chilled out back until the watchman rolled by, then dipped under the tent. i had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some extra cash, but i figured better save it ‘cause you never know when you’ll need that dough when you’re far from home and among random peeps. gotta stay woke. i’m down to drop cash on circuses if the vibe calls, but there’s zero point in wastin’ it.

this circus was straight-up next level. the sight was epic when they rolled in, in pairs—a gentleman and a lady side by side—with the dudes rockin’ just their drawers and undershirts, no shoes or stirrups, chillin’ with their hands on their thighs like it was no biggie—probably about twenty of ‘em—and every lady was a total vibe: flawless, drop-dead gorgeous, legit queens decked out in gear that looked like it cost a fortune and dripped in diamonds. it was a boss-level aesthetic; i ain’t never seen anything so lit. then, one by one, they stood up and strutted around the ring, weavin’ in a smooth, wavy, graceful motion—the dudes lookin’ all tall and airy as they bobbed their heads under the tent roof, and every lady’s rose-patterned dress flutterin’ soft and silky around her hips, makin’ her look like the prettiest parasol ever.

then they kicked it into high gear, dancin’ faster and faster—one foot in the air then the other—with the horses leanin’ more and more, and the ringmaster circlin’ the center pole, whippin’ it out and shoutin’ “hi! hi!” while the clown dropped savage one-liners behind him; soon enough, everyone dropped the reins—ladies poppin’ their knuckles on their hips and gentlemen foldin’ their arms—and then the horses leaned over and did their wild hump dance! one by one, they skipped into the ring and served the sweetest bow i’ve ever seen, then dashed off, and the crowd went absolutely wild, clappin’ and cheerin’.

all through the circus, they pulled off the wildest, most mind-blowing stunts; and the clown’s antics were straight killin’ it—making everyone lose it. the ringmaster couldn’t even throw a word at him ‘cause the clown was always comin’ back with the sickest, quickest comebacks, so on-point it was unreal. i still can’t figure out how he dropped so many zingers all at once; i couldn’t rack that up in a whole year. then, outta nowhere, a drunk dude tried to crash the ring—yellin’ he wanted to ride, claimin’ he could ride as hard as any pro. they argued and tried to kick him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show stalled. then the crowd started hollerin’ and mockin’ him, which ticked him off so bad he started wreckin’ stuff; that got the people hyped, and a bunch of dudes piled off the benches and swarmed the ring, yellin’, “knock him down! toss him out!” while a couple of women screamed. so the ringmaster stepped in and made a quick speech, sayin’ he hoped there wouldn’t be any drama, and that if the guy promised no more trouble, he’d let him ride if he could hang on. everyone cracked up and agreed, and the dude hopped on. the moment he bounced on, the horse went wild—buckin’ and jumpin’ like crazy—with two circus bros clutchin’ its bridle tryna calm it, the drunk dude hangin’ on for dear life around its neck, heels flyin’ with every jump, and the whole crowd standin’ up yellin’ and laughin’ ‘til tears rolled down. and sure enough, after all the circus men did their best, the horse broke loose, blastin’ around the ring like a wild nation, with that drunk dude hangin’ on, first one leg swingin’ low on one side, then the other, and the people went absolutely bonkers. not gonna lie, i was shakin’ from the danger. but soon enough, he managed to mount the horse properly, grabbed the bridle, swayin’ this way and that; and the next minute, he sprang up, dropped the bridle, and stood tall—while the horse kept blastin’ around like it was on fire. he just stood there, cruisin’ like he’d never been wasted in his life—and then he started droppin’ his clothes, slingin’ ‘em all over. he shed so many outfits they practically clogged the air—seventeen suits in total. and then, boom, he transformed into this slim, handsome dude, decked out in the most fly, gaudy, and pretty threads ever, whipped that horse into a frenzy with his whip, and finally skipped off after a crisp bow and wild dance straight to the dressing room, while everyone lost it with amazement.

then the ringmaster peeped that he’d been totally played, and he was the wildest, sickest ringmaster you’d ever see, i swear. like, it was one of his own crew! he cooked up that whole prank out of his own brain, not tellin’ a soul. i felt pretty sheepish for gettin’ duped, but there’s no way i’d wanna be in his shoes—not for a thousand bucks. i dunno, maybe there are tougher circuses out there, but i haven’t seen ‘em yet. anyway, that show was more than enough for me; wherever i come across that vibe again, you know i’m all in.

that night’s show went down, but only about a dozen peeps showed up—just enough to cover the bills. they were crackin’ up non-stop, which ticked off the duke; and everyone bailed before the show ended, except for one boy who was out cold. so the duke goes, “these arkansas lunkheads can’t handle shakespeare—they only get low comedy, or maybe even something even more trash, i swear. i can totally size their style.” so next morning, he grabs huge sheets of wrapping paper, slaps on some black paint, prints out flyers, and sticks ‘em all over the village. the flyer read:

at the courthouse! for 3 nights only! the world-renowned tragedians david garrick the younger! and edmund keen the elder! from the london and continental theatres, in their epic tragedy of the king’s camelopard or the royal nonesuch!!! admission: 50 cents.

then in giant letters: ladies and children not admitted.

“there,” he declares, “if that line doesn’t hook ’em, then i don’t even know arkansas!”

chapter xxiii.

all day long, the duke and the king were grindin’, riggin’ up a stage, hangin’ a curtain, and settin’ up a row of candles for footlights; and that night, the place was jam-packed in no time. when the venue hit max capacity, the duke bailed on door duty, slid around back, and marched onto the stage, steppin’ up in front of the curtain to drop a quick speech hypin’ up the tragedy, claimin’ it was the most thrill-packed show ever. he went on braggin’ about the tragedy and edmund keen the elder, who was set to nail the lead role; and once he got everyone’s hype meter cranked to the max, he rolled up the curtain, and next thing, the king comes prancin’ out on all fours, stark naked—painted all over, with ring stripes and all kinds of colors, as lit as a rainbow. and—i’ll skip the rest of his crazy outfit; it was wild and absurd, but straight-up hilarious. the crowd was dyin’ laughin’; and when the king finished his capers and bounced off behind the scenes, they roared, clapped, and stormed the stage until he popped back out to do it all over again—and then made him repeat it. seriously, it would make even a cow crack up to see the wild shows that old fool pulled.

then the duke lets the curtain drop, bows to the crowd, and announces that the epic tragedy will play for only two more nights, ‘cause he’s got big london gigs lined up—seats already sold out at drury lane; then he bows again and adds, if he managed to please and school them, he’d be hella grateful if they spread the word and brought their crew next time.

then about twenty peeps shout, “what, is it over? is that all?”

the duke confirms, and right then, the place goes wild—everyone shouts “sold!” and rushes toward the stage and them tragedians. but then, a big, fly dude jumps up on a bench and shouts:

hold up, squad! yo, just a sec, my dudes. they hit pause and listened. "yo, we got totally been played—sold out hard, no cap. but we ain’t tryna be the town’s clown and have this mess haunt us 24/7. nah, what we really want is to dip on the low, ghost this whole show, hype it up, and flip the rest of the town! then we all ride the same drip. that sound lit?" (“facts, dawg! the judge is spittin' pure fire!” everybody chimes in.) "aight, then—zip it on any talk of a sell. bounce back home and tell everyone to come peep this epic tragedy."

next day, the whole town was buzzin' non-stop about how lit that show was. the house was packed again that night, and we flipped that crowd just the same. me, the king, and the duke rolled back to the raft, grubbed down a solid supper; and soon, about midnight, they had jim and me haul that ride out, let it cruise dead center down the river, scoop it up, and stash it like two miles below town.

the third night, the pad was hella crammed again—and no newbies this time, just the OG show veterans. i was posted by the duke at the door, peepin' that every dude sliding in had pockets bulgin' or some secret stash under his coat—and trust, it wasn’t no designer cologne drip. i caught whiffs of nasty egg vibes by the barrel and rotten cabbage, like major food fails; and if i know my dead-cat signs (and i totally do), there were like sixty-four peeps cruisin’ in. i dipped in for a hot sec, but it was way too extra for my vibe; i legit couldn’t hang. so when the spot maxed out, the duke slipped a quarter to some homie and told him to hold the door for a minute, then started creeping toward the stage exit. i bounced after him; but the moment we rounded the corner and hit pitch black, he goes:

"yo, hustle out of these cribs and then skid to the raft like the dickens is hot on your trail!"

i was on it, and so was he. we hit the raft simultaneously, and in less than two seconds we were gliding downstream, mad dark and chill, sliding into mid-river without a peep. i figured the poor king was about to get roasted by the crowd, but nah—pretty soon he crawled out from under the wigwam and goes:

"so, how’d our ride vibe this round, duke?"

and he hadn’t even hit up town at all.

we didn’t even flash a light until we were like ten miles below the village. then we sparked it up and grubbed down, while the king and the duke were straight up laughing their skulls off over how they had hustled the peeps. the duke drops:

"noobs, flatheads! i knew the first crib would keep it on the down low and let the rest of the town get lured in; and i was like, yo, they’re gonna flop for us on the third night, thinkin’ it’s their turn. well, now it’s their turn, and i’m hella curious how much cash they’ll snatch for it. i just wanna know how they’re flexin’ their chance. they could even turn it into a picnic if they wanted—they rolled in with mad provisions."

these wild misfits raked in four hundred sixty-five bucks over three nights. i’ve never peeped cash roll in by the wagon-load like that before. later, when everyone was out cold and snorin', jim goes:

"yo, huck, ain’t it wild how these kings be flexin' their drama?"

"nah," i reply, "it don’t hit different."

"why not, huck?"

"cuz it’s in their damn dna, man. i swear, they’re all cut from the same glitch fabric."

"but, huck, our kings are straight-up legendary troublemakers; that’s literally what they are—total rapscallions."

"exactly, bro; i’m sayin’ all kings are basically rapscallions, as far as i can peep."

"for real?"

"peep history once—you’ll see. look at henry the eight; next to him, a sunday-school supervisor is like basic training. and then check charles ii, louis xiv, louis xv, james ii, edward ii, richard iii, and, like, forty more; plus all those ancient saxon gangs that went around wreakin' havoc in the old days. yo, you should’ve seen henry the eight in his prime. dude was in full bloom—a straight-up blossom. he used to marry a new wife every damn day and then chop her head off the next morning, like it was no biggie. he’d be like, "yo, fetch nell gwynn," they’d drag her in; next morning, "off with her head!" and bam, done. then, "ring up jane shore," she rolls in, next morning, "off with her head!"—and they just chop it off. "buzz up fair rosamun." fair rosamun answers, next morning, "off with her head." and he made each one spill the tea every night; kept it up till he hoarded a thousand and one tales, then dumped them into a book he called "domesday book"—which, no cap, was a dope title that summed it all up. you might not vibe with kings, jim, but i got the full deets; and this old scam of ours is legit one of the cleanest i’ve ever clocked. look, henry was all about stirrin' up chaos in the country. how’d he do it? post fancy notices? throw a show for the masses? nah. outta nowhere, he chucked all the tea in boston harbor like trash, dropped a declaration of independence, and dared ‘em to come at him. that was his style—never givin' anyone a fair chance. dude even had beef with his pops, the duke of wellington. so, what’d he do? tell his old man to show up? nah—he dunked him in a barrel of mamsey like he was swipin’ a cat. if cash was chillin’ around, what’d he do? he snatched it up. if someone paid him for a gig and then ghosted on checkin’ his work—what’d he do? he always flipped the script. if he opened his mouth—yo, if he didn’t shut it down mad quick, he’d lose his rep every damn time. that’s the kind of wild card henry was; and if we’d had one of him instead of our lame kings, he’d have hoodwinked the town way harder than our crew ever did. not sayin’ our peeps are total weaklings ’cause they ain’t, when you break it down to the cold facts; but compared to that old beast, they’re straight-up basic. bottom line: kings are kings, and you gotta cut ’em some slack. take ’em all together—they’re one mad ornery bunch. it’s just how they were raised.

"but yo, this one actually reeks of that nation vibe, huck."

"nah, jim, they all got that signature stank; you can’t help a king’s whiff—history don’t drop the tea on that."

"now, the duke? he’s sorta chill in his own cheesy way."

"yeah, a duke’s got his own flavor. but lowkey, he ain’t all that different. this dude’s solidly average for a duke—when he’s wasted, no one could peep a difference between him and a king."

"well, anyways, i ain’t tryna deal with any more of that nonsense, huck. that’s all i can stan."

"i feel you, jim. but they’re stuck with us, and we gotta remember what they are and roll with it. sometimes, i lowkey dream of a country where kings don’t even exist."

what’s the point of spittin’ the tea about how these dudes ain’t legit kings and dukes? it wouldn’t change a damn thing; after all, you can’t even tell ’em apart from the real deal.

i crashed hard, and jim totally ghosted me when it was my turn—he always did that. when i finally woke at daybreak, there he was, hunched down with his head between his knees, straight up moaning and gettin’ all sentimental. i kept it low, ’cause i knew exactly what was up. he was missing his wifey and his kids way up yonder, feeling mad homesick—since he’d never left his crib before; and i swear, he cared for his crew as hard as white folks care for their own. it might seem kinda weird, but that’s the real tea. he’d go off that sad song at night, when he knew i was knocked out, yellin’, "po' little 'lizabeth! po' little johnny! it’s mad rough; i reckon i ain’t ever gonna peep you again, like, ever!" man, jim was one of the best nay nay there ever was.

but this time, i somehow got into a deep convo with him about his wifey and his mini-mes; and eventually he goes:

"yo, what got me feelin' so wrecked this time is that i heard some wild noise over on the bank—a crazy whack or slam, ya know—ever since i started treatin' my little 'lizabeth all extra. she was barely a year old when she got hit with that scarlet fever and went through a brutal spell; but she bounced back, and one day she was just chillin', and i was like:

"yo, she gonna do it."

she just stood there, straight up smilin' at me. it twisted my vibe; so i hollered, loud as hell,

"you not hearin' me?—she’s gonna do it!"

she just kept standing, still smilin’. i was pissed, bro! then i snapped, "i swear, i’m takin’ you for mine!" and with that, i smacked her right on the dome so hard it almost sent her flyin'. then i dipped into the other room for about ten minutes; when i bounced back, the door was still wide open, and there she was, sittin' right there, starin' down and mournerin', tears just drippin'. damn, i was mad! i was fixin’ to handle the situation, but then—a crazy gust slammed somethin' behind her, bam!—and the kid just froze, no movement whatsoever! my heart nearly skipped a beat; i was so messed up i couldn’t even process. i edged in, all trembly and slow, cracked the door open real gentle, and peeped in behind her, all soft and quiet, then—pow! i yelled as loud as i could. she didn’t even flinch! oh, huck, i busted out cryin', scooped her up in my arms, and was bawlin', "oh, my poor little one! lord above, forgive old jim, ’cause he’ll never forgive himself for this, as long as he’s breathin'!" man, she was straight-up dense and clueless—totally deef and dumb—and i’d been treatin' her like that!

chapter xxiv.

next day, near night, our crew parked under a little willow hangout smack in the middle, with a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king started schemin’ on how to work those towns. jim rolled up to the duke and was like, "i hope this only takes a few hours, cuz bein’ cooped up in that wigwam all day, all tied up like a noob, is mad exhausting." you see, when we left him solo, we had to rope him up—’cause if anyone caught him on his own without the ties, it wouldn’t exactly scream runaway nay nay, ya know? so the duke was like, "yo, it’s rough bein’ tied all day; i gotta hack out a fix."

the duke was mad smart and he quickly cooked up a plan. he rigged jim out in full-on king lear cosplay—a long, curtain-calico gown, a white horse-hair wig with whiskers—and then grabbed his theater makeup to slap jim’s face, hands, ears, and neck with this dead, dull, solid blue look, like a dude who’s been drowned for nine days straight. i swear, never did i see a more straight-up horrific look. then duke scribbled on a plank a sign that read:

sick arab—but harmless when not out of his head.

he nailed that bad boy to a board and propped it up four or five feet right in front of the wigwam. jim was totally vibin’ with that; he said it was way cooler than bein’ tied up every day, shakin’ at every sound. the duke told him to chill, make himself comfy, and if anyone came snoopin’, he should bounce out of the wigwam, strut some, and let out a wild howl like a beast—figurin’ that’d scare off the haters. solid plan, though most regulars wouldn’t wait for his howl; dude didn’t just look dead, he looked like next-level dead.

these rapscallions were hyped to try the nonesuch act again, ’cause the cash was mad sticky, but they figured it wouldn’t be safe now ’cause the word might’ve already dropped. they couldn’t nail a project that hit just right; so eventually the duke was like, "aight, imma take a breather, flex my brain for an hour or two, and see if i can whip up something for the arkansaw village," while the king was like, "i’ll slide over to the other village with zero plan—just lettin’ providence (or the devil, no cap) lead me to that bag." we all copped some fresh threads from our last stop; then the king geared up and told me, "yo, get your fit on, huckleberry." obviously, i did. the king’s new duds were all black and drippin’ with that sleek, stiff swag. i never knew clothes could flip a dude’s vibe so hard—before, he looked like the ornery old rip that ever existed; but now, when he’d ditch his new white beaver cap, throw in a bow, and flash a smile, he looked so on point and righteous you’d swear he just stepped out of the ark—maybe even old leviticus himself. jim tidied up the canoe, and i grabbed my paddle. there was a big steamboat chillin’ by the shore under the point, about three miles up from the town—been parked there for a couple hours loadin’ freight. then the king drops:

"yo, seein’ how i’m draped, i suppose i should be rollin’ in from st. louis or cincinnati, or some massive city. go snag the steamboat, huckleberry; we’re headin’ to that village on her."

i didn’t need no extra hype to catch a steamboat ride. i hit up the shore about half a mile past the village, then skated along the bluff bank in the chill water. before long, we bumped into this sweet, unsuspecting young country kid posted on a log, swipin’ the sweat off his face ‘cause the heat was mad intense, and he had a couple of oversized carpet bags with him.

the king was like, "yo, bring his nose inshore," and i did just that. then he asked, "where you headin', young blood?"

the kid goes, "to the steamboat; i’m bound for orleans."

the king then goes, "hop aboard. hold up a sec, my boy’s gonna help you with those bags. jump out and help the gentleman, adolphus"—which, lowkey, meant me.

i did that, and the three of us bounced off. the young guy was super thankful; said it was rough hauling his bags in this blazing heat. he then asked the king where he was headin’, and the king explained he’d cruised down the river, landed at the other village this morning, and now was paddlin’ up a few miles to link up with an old homie on a farm up there. the kid then goes:

"when i first saw you, i was like, 'yo, it's mr. wilks, and he almost made it here in time.' but then i was like, 'nah, you ain’t him, or else you wouldn’t be paddlin’ up the river.' you ain’t mr. wilks, are you?"

"nah, my name’s blodgett—elexander blodgett—reverend elexander blodgett, i guess, since i’m one of the lord’s humble servants. but still, i feel bad for mr. wilks for missin’ his cue, if he actually missed somethin’—and i hope he didn’t."

"well, he won’t miss any cash, ’cause he’ll catch that; but he did miss seein’ his bro peter kick the bucket—which he might not even care about, no cap—but his bro would've given anything to see him one last time; they hadn’t swapped stories in like three weeks, not seen each other since they were youngins—and he never even peeped his bro william, the clueless one—william’s barely thirty or thirty-five. peter and george were the only ones droppin’ by; george was the married bro—both he and his wife dipped last year. harvey and william are the only ones still in the game—and like i said, they didn’t roll in on time."

"did anyone hit ’em up with word?"

"oh, for sure; like a month or two back when peter first got snatched, ’cause peter was all, 'i don’t feel like bounce back this time.' you know, he was hella old, and george’s girls were too young to vibe as company for him—aside from mary jane, the redhead—so he was mad lonely after george and his wife dipped, and didn’t really wanna live. he was desperate to see harvey—and william too—’cause he was the type who just couldn’t cope with makin’ a will. he left a letter for harvey, spillin’ where he stashed his cash and how he wanted the rest split so george’s girls would be straight, ’cause george left nothin’. that letter was all they got from him."

"so, you reckon harvey ain’t comin’? where’s he at?"

"oh, he’s chillin’ in england—in sheffield—preaches there—and never even hit up this country. he hasn’t been around long, plus he might not even have gotten that letter, ya know."

"that’s rough, bro, too bad he won’t live to see his bros, poor dude. so you headin’ to orleans, right?"

"yeah, but that’s just part of it. i’m catchin’ a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero, where my uncle’s posted up."

"that’s a long haul. but bet it’s gonna be dope; man, i wish i was headin’ that way. is mary jane the oldest? how old are the rest?"

"mary jane’s nineteen, susan’s fifteen, and joanna’s about fourteen—that’s the one always doin’ good deeds, even with a hare-lip."

"poor kids! left to fend for themselves in this cold, harsh world, huh."

but yo, it could be worse. old peter had a whole squad, and none of them are gonna let any harm come to these kids. there’s hobson, that babtis preacher; deacon lot hovey; ben rucker; abner shackleford; levi bell the lawyer; dr. robinson and their wives; widow bartley; and a bunch more—these were peter’s ride-or-die homies, always gettin’ shoutouts in his letters back home—so harvey will know exactly where to find some real ones when he rolls in.

the old man kept grillin’ the kid with questions until he drained him dry—askin’ about everyone and everythin’ in that blessed town, all about the wilkses; peter’s gig as a tanner; george’s hustle as a carpenter; harvey’s time as a rebel minister; and on and on. then he goes, "yo, why’d you trek all the way up to this steamboat?" 

"cuz it’s a major orleans boat, and i was lowkey scared it wouldn’t stop here. when they’re deep in the water, they don’t drop for a hail. a cincinnati boat would, but this one’s all st. louis style."

"yo, was peter wilks loaded?"

"oh, for sure—he had cribs, land, and word is he stashed three or four grand in cash somewhere."

"when did you say he kicked the bucket?"

"i didn’t drop that deets, but it was last night."

"funeral tomorrow, then?"

"yeah, smack in the middle of the day."

"man, that’s mad tragic; but we gotta bounce eventually. so we just gotta be ready, then we’re all good."

"facts, sir, that’s the best play. ma always used to say that."

when we hit the boat, they were almost done loadin’ up, and soon she dipped. the king never even mentioned jumpin’ aboard, so i totally lost my ride. when the boat bounced, the king had me paddle another mile to a loner spot, then he hopped ashore and goes:

"yo, hustle back right now and scoop up the duke and the new carpet bags. and if the duke’s slidin’ on over to the other side, go grab him. tell him to roll up regardless—move it, now."

i caught his drift, but kept quiet, of course. when i got back with the duke, we stashed the canoe, then they plopped down on a log while the king spilled every single deets exactly as the kid had laid it out—every damn word. all the while, king was tryna sound proper english-like; and for a total slacker, he nailed it pretty well. i can’t even pull that off, so i ain’t tryna; but seriously, he did a bang-up job. then he goes:

"so, how you doin' on the mute act, bilgewater?"

the duke was like, "chill, leave him be—he was just playin’ the mute on stage." then they kicked it while waitin’ for a steamboat.

around mid-afternoon, a couple of little boats floated by, but they weren’t comin’ high enough up the river; then finally a big one showed up, and they hailed her. she sent out her yawl and we hopped aboard—turns out she was from cincinnati; but when they peeped that we only wanted to cruise four or five miles, they flipped out, cussin’ us out and sayin’ they weren’t gonna drop us. but the king came through. he says:

“yo, if them classy gents are cool droppin’ a buck per mile just to get scooped up and dropped off in a lil’ boat, and a steamboat’s legit able to haul ‘em around, ain’t that the vibe, no cap?”

so they chilled out and was like, “aight, we’re set,” and when we rolled into the village, they dropped our asses off from the yawl. like, about two dozen dudes swarmed down when they peeped the yawl comin’ up, and then the king goes off:

“any of you fine gentlemen know where mr. peter wilks is posted?”

they exchanged looks and nodded like, “yo, what do you need?” then one of ‘em, all soft-spoken and chill, goes:

“my bad, sir, but the best we can do is drop you the deets on where he was chillin’ last evening.”

suddenly, quicker than a blink, this crusty old dude lost his chill—he smashed into the guy, leaned his chin on his shoulder, and started ranting down his back, like:

“damn, damn, our poor bro is ghost—gone, and we never even got to peep him; oh, it’s way too harsh!”

then he spins around, bawlin’ his eyes out, flingin’ a bunch of goofy hand signs at the duke, and, no cap, he even drops his carpet-bag and loses it crying. i mean, if there ever were two clapped-out scam artists, these two were peak.

next, the dudes all huddled up, throwin’ out all sorts of kind words while lugging their carpet-bags up the hill, lettin’ the crybaby duo lean on ‘em and unload their feels. they spilled all the tea ‘bout the king’s bro’s final moments, and then the king recapped every single deet to the duke—both of ‘em mournin’ that dead tanner like they’d just lost the twelve ultimate squad members. i swear, if i ever saw anything like that, i’m a nay nay. it was enough to make anyone lose faith in humanity, no cap.

chapter xxv.

ngl, the news was blowin’ up town in like two minutes, and you could literally see peeps dashing mad from every angle, throwin’ on their coats on the fly. before long, we found ourselves smack in the middle of a massive mob, and the stompin’ sound was like some serious soldier march. every window and yard was packed, and every minute someone would holler over a fence:

“yo, is that them?”

and some hustlin’ homie with the crew would fire back:

“facts, bet it is.”

when we rolled up to the crib, the street in front was packed tight, with three girls posted at the door. mary jane—rockin’ that redhead drip, which didn’t even matter ‘cause she was straight up stunning, with her face and eyes lit up like pure glory—was hella hyped that her uncles had rolled in. the king threw his arms wide, and mary jane jumped right into ‘em, while the hare-lip bounced over to the duke—and boom! everyone, especially the ladies, was losing it over this epic reunion.

then the king pulled the duke aside—i swear, i totally peeped that move—and glanced around to spot a coffin chillin’ in the corner on two chairs. so, with one hand draped over each other’s shoulder and the other shading their eyes like they were checkin’ out some scandal, the king and the duke strolled all slow and solemn over there. the whole crowd backed off, and the noise died down to a hush, with folks whispering “shh” and the dudes offin’ their hats and droppin’ their heads so hard you could literally hear a pin drop.

when they got there, they leaned in over that coffin, took one savage look, and then burst into tears loud enough to be heard all the way to orleans. they clung together, draping their arms around each other’s necks and leanin’ their chins on one another’s shoulders, and for like three or four minutes, i’ve never seen two dudes cry as hard as that. and, real talk, everyone else got in on it too; the joint got so damp with tears, i’ve never seen anything like it.

then one of ‘em slid to one side of the coffin, the other to the opposite, dropped to his knees, and rested his forehead on the cold wood like he was prayin’ solo. when that went down, the whole mob was hit with next-level feels—everyone broke down and started sobbin’ out loud (even the poor girls got caught up in it). nearly every lady marched over in silent solidarity, planted a solemn kiss on the forehead of one of the girls, rested a hand there, looked up at the sky with tears streamin’ down, and then, boom—they all broke into a fresh round of bawlin’ and wailing so hard it was a straight-up show. i’ve never seen anything so extra, so damn over-the-top.

soon after, the king got back on his feet, shuffled forward a bit, and got all worked up, droppin’ a tear-soaked, flapdoodle speech about how brutal it was for him and his poor bro to lose the dude, and how it hurt that they’d never see him alive again after a grueling four-thousand-mile trek. but yo, that pain got kinda blessed by all the mad today-sympathy and holy tears, so he thanked everyone from the bottom of his heart—and his bro’s heart too—‘cause words were just too weak and cold to express the feels. by the time he was done, he was bawlin’ out a pious, goody-goody amen before totally losing it in another crying fit.

the minute those words dropped, someone in the crowd busted out a doxolojer, and before you knew it, everyone joined in with full send, and it warmed you up like that glow you get when church lets out. music is straight fire; after all that soul-melt and hogwash, i’ve never seen anything refresh the vibe like that, soundin’ so raw and real.

then the king started flexin’ his jaw again, announcin’ that he and his nieces would be hella glad if a few of the family’s main homies rolled in for supper that evening to help sort out the ashes of the departed. he went off sayin’ that if his poor bro chillin’ yonder could talk, he’d have named a crew of folks dear to him—names he dropped left and right in his letters. so here’s who he’d honor: rev. mr. hobson, deacon lot hovey, mr. ben rucker, abner shackleford, levi bell, dr. robinson, plus their wives, and the widow bartley.

rev. hobson and dr. robinson were out on the edge of town on some huntin’ vibes—that is, like, the doc was busy shippin’ a seriously sick dude to the next world while the preacher was, i dunno, pintin’ him right. lawyer bell was off up in louisville on biz, but the rest of the squad was present; they all rolled up, shook hands with the king, dropped a bunch of thank-yous, and had a good chinwag with him. then they did the same with the duke—no words, just constant smilin’ and noddin’ like a bunch of clueless sapheads, while the duke flailed his hands around, goin’ “goo-goo—goo-goo-goo” like some babbling baby who couldn’t form a proper word.

so the king kept on blabberin’, askin’ about basically every single person—and even every dog—in town by name, and droppin’ a load of random tea about stuff that went down in town, with george’s fam, or even peter. he always acted like peter himself sent him the deets—but that was pure cap: he scooped up every little bit from that young flathead we canoed up to the steamboat.

then mary jane scooped up the letter her dad left behind, and the king read it out loud while bawlin’. the letter dished out that the crib and three grand in gold were all for the girls; it also gifted the tanyard (which was totally killin’ it), along with some extra houses and land worth ‘bout seven grand, and three grand in gold to harvey and william, plus spillin’ where six grand in cash was stashed down in the cellar.

so these two scammin’ frauds were like, “we got this, we’ll go fetch it up and keep everything square and above-board,” and then they told me to roll up with a candle. we shut the cellar door behind us, and when they popped the bag open, the cash spilled all over the floor in a mad display of yaller-boys. damn, the way the king’s eyes lit up was unreal! he smacked the duke on the shoulder and goes:

“oh, this ain’t bully or nothing! no cap, i reckon it’s straight up better than the nonesuch, don’t it?”

the duke was totally down with that. they grabbed hold of the yaller-boys, letting ‘em slide through their fingers and clatter onto the floor, and the king went off:

“ain’t no use babblin’ about it; bein’ bros to a rich dead man and standin’ in for leftover furrin heirs is our lane, bilge. this is basically providence on lock. long story short, i’ve tried every hack out there, and there’s literally no better way.”

most folks woulda been chill with that pile on trust, but nah—they had to count it. so they did, and it came out four hundred and fifteen bucks short. the king grumbled:

“dang it, i wonder what the sneaky dude did with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?”

they stressed about it for a minute and tore through the stash huntin’ for the missing cash. then the duke chimed in:

“yo, he was pretty messed up and probably just goofed—i reckon that’s just how he rolls. best move is to let it slide and keep low-key about it. we can totally spare that loss.”

“oh, shucks, yeah, we can spare it. i ain’t fussin’ about that—it’s all about the count, ya feel? we gotta be hella square, open, and above-board. we’re gonna haul this cash upstairs and count it in front of everybody—then nothing’s sus. but when the dead dude claimed there’s six grand, you know, we ain’t tryna—”

“hold up,” the duke interjects, “let’s just fake the deficit,” and he starts pullin’ out some yaller-boys from his pocket.

“that’s an amazin’ idea, duke—you got one rattlin’ clever head on you,” the king goes. “blessed if the old nonesuch ain’t savin’ us again,” as he begins haulin’ out yaller-jackets and stackin’ ‘em up.

it pretty much wrecked ‘em, but yo, they managed to patch up the six grand, clean and clear.

“yo,” says the duke, “i got another idea. let’s haul the cash upstairs, count it, and then hand it over to the girls.”

“oh, duke, lemme hug you right now! that’s the most dazzling idea i’ve ever peeped. you seriously got the most astonishin’ brain i know. this is the ultimate boss move, no cap. let ‘em bring all their sus vibes if they want—this is gonna smack ‘em down.”

when we rolled upstairs, everyone clustered round the table as the king counted out and stacked the cash—three hundred dollars in one stack, broken into twenty sleek little piles. peeps were practically starvin’ for it, lickin’ their chops. then they raked it all back into a bag, and i peeped the king swell up for another epic speech. he goes:

“friends all, my poor bro chillin’ yonder has been mega generous to those left behind in the valley of sorrow. he’s blessed these poor lil lambs he loved and sheltered—now left without a dad or mom. and we who knew him know he’d have gone even harder for ‘em if he wasn’t scared of hurtin’ dear william and me. now, wouldn’t he? i got zero doubt in my mind. so tell me, what kinda brothers would even step in his way at a time like this? and what kinda uncles would dare—yeah, dare—steal such sweet, poor lambs that he loved so damn much? if i know william—and i think i do—well, i’ll just ask him.”

then he spins around, blastin’ a slew of wild hand signals at the duke, who just stares dumb like he’s got a leaky brain; next thing, the duke totally catches the drift, jumps on the king, goin’ all “goo-goo” with pure joy, hugging him like fifteen times before finally chillin’. then the king goes:

“i knew it; i reckon that’ll convince anyone how he really feels. here, mary jane, susan, joanner—take the cash, all of it. it’s the gift from our bro yonder, cold yet joyful.”

mary jane leaped for the king, while susan and the hare-lip did the same for the duke. everyone pressed in, teary-eyed, and nearly every woman patted these two fraudsters on the back, constantly sayin’:

“you beautiful souls!—so lovely!—how could you?”

after that, pretty soon all eyes got back to talkin’ about the deceased—how awesome he was and what a huge loss he’d been—until a big-ass, iron-jawed dude strutted in from outside, just standin’ there listenin’ and starin’, not sayin’ a word. nobody even addressed him ‘cause the king was on a roll and everyone was busy listenin’. the king, mid-speech, goes:

“—they’re the extra tight friends of the dearly departed. that’s why they’re invited tonight; but tomorrow, i want everyone to roll through—every single person; ‘cause he respected and liked everyone, and it only makes sense that his funeral orgies be public.”

and so he kept on rantin’, lovin’ the sound of his own voice, droppin’ bits about his funeral orgies every now and then, just like old times, until the duke couldn’t stand it anymore; so he scribbled on a scrap of paper, “obsequies, you old fool,” folded it up, and started flingin’ it over everyone’s heads like some wild party trick. the king read it, popped it into his pocket, and goes:

“poor william, all messed up as he is, with a heart that’s still lit. he asked me to invite everyone to the funeral—to make ‘em all feel welcome. but don’t sweat it, that was just what i was already planning.”

then he kept on cruisin’, totally calm, droppin’ hints of his funeral orgies every so often like he’d done before. and when he hit the third drop, he goes:

“i say ‘orgies’ not ‘obsequies’—obsequies done got old in england; it’s totally out. now we say orgies ‘cause it nails exactly what you’re after. it’s built from the greek ‘orgo’ meanin’ outside, open, abroad; and the hebrew ‘jeesum’ meanin’ to plant or cover up—hence inter. so, peep it: funeral orgies is just an open, public funeral.”

man, he was the worst i ever struck. then that iron-jawed dude straight-up laughed in his face. everyone was shook—folks were like, “yo, doctor!” and then abner shackleford goes:

“yo, robinson, you ain’t heard? this is harvey wilks.”

the king grinned all hyped, stickin’ his tongue out a bit, and goes:

“is that my poor bro’s legit best friend and doctor? i—”

“keep your hands off me!” snaps the doctor. “you sound like an english dude, don’t you? that’s the worst mimicry i’ve ever heard. you’re peter wilks’s brother! you’re a straight-up fraud, no cap!”

and oh man, how they all went off! they crowded around the doctor, tryna quiet him down and explain that harvey had shown in like forty ways that he was the real deal—knowing everyone’s name (even the dogs’)—beggin’ him not to hurt harvey’s feels or the girls’, and all that extra noise. but it was straight-up useless; the doc stormed off, yellin’ that any dude who pretends to be an englishman and can’t drop the lingo any better than he does is nothing but a fraud and a liar. the poor girls clung to the king, cryin’ their eyes out, when suddenly the doctor spun around and flipped on them. he goes:

“i was your father’s buddy, and i’m still your friend; so listen up as an honest homie who only wants to keep you safe from trouble—ditch that scumbag and have nothing to do with him, that clueless tramp with his bogus greek and hebrew mumbo jumbo. he’s the flimsiest, most basic impostor ever—rolled in here with a bunch of empty names and random facts he picked up somewhere, and you all actually take ‘em as proof, getting played by these dumb pals who should know better. mary jane wilks, you know me as your friend and your selfless homie, too. now listen—kick this pathetic poser out, i beg you. will you?”

mary jane snapped to attention—and damn, she was lookin’ fine—then she declares:

“here’s my answer.”

she hoisted up the bag of cash and shoved it into the king’s hands, sayin’, “take this six grand and invest it however you want for me and my sisters—no receipt, aight?”

then she wrapped her arm around the king on one side, while susan and the hare-lip did the same for the duke. the whole crowd started clappin’ and stompin’ like a wild rave, and the king held his head high, smilin’ like he just won the lotto. the doctor then goes:

“alright; i’m out—i wash my hands of all this. but yo, i warn you, there’ll be a day when just thinkin’ about this moment makes you feel downright sick.”

“alright, doctor,” the king shoots back in a playful roast, “we’ll try to get ‘em to send for you,” which had everyone crackin’ up, callin’ it a prime solid hit.

chapter xxvi.

once everyone bounced, the king asked mary jane how their spare room sitch was lookin’, and she was like, “i got one extra room that’ll work for uncle william, and i can even give my own room to uncle harvey—which is a bit bigger—and i’ll crash with my sisters on a cot; plus, up in the garret there’s a tiny cubby with a pallet in it.” the king then dropped, “that cubby works for my valley,” meanin’ me.

so mary jane took us upstairs and gave us the tour of the digs, which were plain but nice. she mentioned she’d clear out her frocks and other gear from her room if they got in uncle harvey’s way, but he was like, “nah, that’s chill.” the frocks were hung along the wall, with a calico curtain hangin’ down to the floor. there was an old hair trunk in one corner, a guitar-box in another, and a bunch of random knickknacks and trinkets scattered around like how girls deck out a room. the king said it all made the place extra homey and chill, so don’t even mess with it. the duke’s room was kinda small but more than enough, and my cubby was solid too.

that night, they threw down for a big supper with all the men and women there. i ended up standin’ behind the king and duke’s chairs, servin’ them, while the nay nay handled the rest.

mary jane sat at the head of the table with susan right beside her, and went off complainin’ about how harsh the biscuits were, how the preserves were mean, and how the fried chickens were ridiculously tough—all that extra chatter women drop to force out compliments. but everyone already knew everything was tiptop, and they kept throwin’ out stuff like, “how do you get biscuits to brown so perfectly?” and “yo, where’d you snag these amazin’ pickles?” and all that extra humbug, just the usual supper vibe.

when all that was done, the hare-lip and i grabbed the leftover grub in the kitchen, while the rest of the crew—yeah, the nay nay—helped clean up the mess.

the hare-lip started jabberin’ about england, and swear down, i almost believed that the ice was gettin’ mad thin sometimes. she goes:

“did you ever peep the king?”

“who, william fourth? i bet i have—he rolls to our church.”

i knew he was ghost years ago, but kept it on the down-low. so when i said he rolls to our church, she goes:

“what—regular?”

“yeah—regular. his pew’s sittin’ right opposite ours, on the other side of the pulpit.”

“i thought he was livin’ in london?”

“well, he is. where else would he be?”

“but i thought you were in sheffield?”

i was totally stumped. i had to act like i got choked on a chicken bone just to buy some time to figure my exit. then i goes:

“i mean he rolls to our church regularly when he’s in sheffield—only in the summer, when he pops over for his sea baths.”

“yo, but how you gonna take sea baths when sheffield ain’t even on the sea?”

“well, who even said it was?”

“yo, you did!”

“i didn’t say anythin’ else.”

“you did!”

“i didn’t.”

“you did.”

“i never said nothin’ of the kind.”

“so, what did you even say then?”

“i said he comes to take the sea baths—that’s literally what i said.”

“so then, how’s he gonna take sea baths if there’s no sea?”

“check it,” i says, “did you ever peep any congress-water?”

“yeah.”

“so did you have to go to congress to get it?”

“nah, not at all.”

“well, then, neither does william fourth need to hit the sea for a sea bath. so, how does he even cop it, then?”

yo, check it: down here they be gettin’ that congress-water in barrels. all the way in the palace at sheffield, they got lit furnaces, and dude wants his water scaldin’. they can’t boil up that much water way out at sea—no cap, they ain’t got the hookups for it.

oh, i getchu now. you coulda dropped that deets earlier and saved mad time.

when she drops that “i see,” i’m like, boom—outta the woods again, feelin’ comfy and stoked. then she goes:

“yo, you hit up church too?”

“yeah—on the reg.”

“and where you chill?”

“obviously in our pew.”

“whose pew though?”

“hella ours—your uncle harvey’s be it.”

“his? like, what vibe he got with a pew?”

“he needs that pew to be set up proper. what did you figure he was about?”

“man, i thought he’d be flexin’ up in the pulpit.”

dang, snapped—i totally spaced that he was a preacher. i was stuck, so i racked my brain like a game of chicken bones and came through with another take. then i go:

“seriously though, you think a church ain’t got like only one preacher?”

“what, are they tryna drop a sermon rap battle or somethin’?”

“what!—preach for a king? dude, i ain’t never peeped a chick like you. they be stackin’ up, no cap, seventeen preachers.”

seventeen?! damn, no cap, i wouldn’t roll out a line that long even if i hit legendary status. that squad would def take like a whole week, fr.

ikr, they ain’t all droppin’ sermons the same day—only one actually gets to spit.

so, like, what do the rest do then?

oh, they be straight chillin’, lollin’ around, passin’ the plate—and doing one thing or another. but mostly, they just don’t do much.

so yo, what’s their vibe for then?

they’re all about style, bruh. you seriously don’t know nothin’?

aight, i ain’t tryna vibe with that dumb talk. how are servants treated in england, bro? do they treat ‘em better than we treat our nay nay?

nah, dude! a servant ain’t nothin’ over there. they treat ‘em even worse than dogs, facts.

ain’t they hooked up with holidays like we do—christmas, new year’s week, and fourth of july vibes?

bro, listen up! you could tell if you ain’t been to england by that. like, hare-l—i mean joanna, they don’t even see a holiday from one year’s end to the next; never hit up the circus, theater, nay nay shows, or random spots.

and church?

nah—church ain’t poppin’.

but yo, you always caught those church vibes.

man, i totally spaced that i was on duty as the old man’s servant. then, in the next sec, i got hit with some whack explanation about how a valley (whatever that is) ain't like a regular servant and has to hit church whether he wants to or not, sittin’ with the fam ‘cause that’s the law. i laid it down pretty lame, and when i was done, i could tell she wasn’t vibin’. so she goes:

“honest injun, fr, you been spinnin’ mad lies, haven’t ya?”

“honest injun,” i say.

“none of it at all?”

“none of it, promise. not a cap in it.”

“put your hand on that book and state it.”

i peeped that it was just a dictionary, so i slapped my hand on it and recited. she seemed a bit more chill, then goes:

“aight, i might buy some of that, but i hope to believe the rest if it’s on the low.”

“yo, what parts you not feelin’, joe?” chimes mary jane, steppin’ in with susan right behind her. “it ain’t cool or kind for you to spit that at him—he’s a stranger, mad far from his crew. how would you feel if someone dissed you like that?”

“man, that’s just your jam, maim—always jumpin’ in to help someone before they get hurt. i didn’t do nothin’ bad to him. he might’ve been flexin’ some stretchers, i guess, but i straight up said i wasn’t gonna bite the whole bait; i kept it 100, every bit. bet he can handle a little shade, right?”

“look, i don’t care if it was a minor drip or a heavy downpour; he’s here in our crib and a stranger, and it was straight-up uncool for you to drop that. if you were in his kicks, you’d be shook and ashamed—so don’t go sayin’ things that make someone feel that way.”

“but, mam, he was like—”

“nah, it don’t matter what he said—that ain’t the point. the real flex is treatin’ him right and not draggin’ up how he ain’t on home turf with his own crew.”

i whispered to myself, yo, this girl is gettin’ jacked by that crusty old snake snatchin’ her cash!

next, susan sashays in; and no cap, she totally gave hare-lip some major vibes straight outta the tomb!

i think to myself again, another chick gettin’ cruised off her money!

then mary jane takes her turn, all sweet and adorbs like always—that’s her signature move; but by the time she wrapped it, there wasn’t nearly a dime left for poor hare-lip. so she starts hollerin’.

“aight, then,” the other girls chirp, “just go snag his pardon.”

she pulled it off too; and damn, she nailed it. so beautiful it made the vibe pure, and i was low-key wishin’ i could drop a thousand caped fables on her, so she could do it again.

i was thinkin’, yo, another chick gettin’ jacked by his scam, and when she was done, they all cozied up to make me feel at home, like i was deep in the friend crew. i was hella bitter—so low-key mean—that i decided: i’m gonna give them that money, or i’m straight-up bustin’.

so then, i bounced off—to my bed, i mean, eventually. once i was solo, i started overthinkin’ the sitch. should i roll up to that private doc and spill the tea on these fraudsters? nah, that ain’t in the cards. he might snitch on who spilled the tea; then the king and the duke would come down on me hardcore. should i go and clue mary jane in? nah—I’m not about that life. her face would totally give it away, and they already got the loot, they'd scoot out and dip. if she called in backup, i'd be tangled up in the biz before it was even done, fr. no; there ain’t no safe move but one. i gotta swipe that cash somehow, in a way that don’t tip ‘em off. they got a dope setup here, and they won’t bail till they milk this fam and town for every last buck, so i’ll find a chance eventually. i’ll ghost with the cash and stash it; and later, when i’m cruisin’ down the river, i’ll drop mary jane a letter with the deets. but i better secure it tonight if i can—‘cause the doc might not be as chill as he acts; he could scare ‘em off for real.

so then, i think to myself, i’ll go scope out the rooms. upstairs, the hall was mad dark, but i scoped the duke’s room and started rummagin’ with my hands; then it hit me—it ain’t the king’s style to let anyone handle his money except himself—so i bounced over to his room and started riflin’ through there. but real talk, i couldn’t do squat without a candle, and striking one is a no-go, obviously. so i figured the alternative was to play spy and eavesdrop. right about then, i heard their footfalls comin’, and i was fixin’ to dive under the bed; i reached for it, but it wasn’t where i expected. i ended up clutchin’ the curtain hidin’ mary jane’s frocks, so i dove behind it, nestled among the gowns, and froze like a straight-up statue.

they roll in and slam the door; and the duke, no cap, is the first to check under the bed. then i was super relieved i didn’t have to jump in there. though, i mean, it’s natural to hide under a bed when you’re plotin’ shady biz. they sat down, and the king goes:

“alright, what’s the move? and keep it snappy, ‘cause it’s way better to be down there whoppin’ up the mourning than givin’ ‘em a chance to come at us.”

“yo, here’s the sitch, capet. i ain’t feelin’ chill; i’m hella uneasy. that doc’s been heavy on my mind. i wanna know yo’ plans. i got a notion, and trust me—it’s sound.”

“spill it, duke—what’s the move?”

“i say we bounce outta here before like three in the morning, and dip down the river with what we’ve got. especially since it’s coming back to us—basically tossed at our door when we had to swipe it back. i’m all about ghostin’ and bouncin’ out.”

that hit me in the feels, bruh. like, an hour or two ago, i might’ve been on board, but now i was just bummed and disappointed. then the king snaps and goes:

“what! and we ain’t flippin’ the rest of the property? march off like a bunch of fools and leave eight or nine grand worth of property just chillin’, ready to be scooped up?—and it’s all primo, sale-ready swag too.”

the duke grumbles low-key; he reckons that bag of gold is enough, and he ain’t tryna dive deeper—ain’t about robbin’ a whole lot from orphans of their entire stash.

“damn, look how you talk!” the king fires back. “we ain’t robbin’ ‘em of anything but this cash. the buyers for that property are the suckers; ‘cause once it’s discovered we didn’t even own it—which won’t be long after we dip—the sale goes bust and it all goes back to the estate. these orphans will get their crib back, and that’s plenty; they’re young, agile, and can hustle up a livin’. they ain’t gonna suffer. just think—there’re thousands who ain’t rollin’ in dough. seriously, they got nothing to complain about.”

yo, the king went on a nonstop rant; so finally he caved, sayin’ alright, but mentioned it was straight-up foolishness to stick around with that doc hangin’ over us. then the king goes:

“to hell with the doc! why do we even need him? ain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? that’s more than enough majorities anywhere, trust.”

so they got ready to bounce downstairs again, and the duke says:

“yo, i don’t think we stashed that cash in the best spot.”

that lit me up, real talk. i was trippin’, thinkin’ i wasn’t gonna catch a single clue to help me out. then the king asks:

“why?”

“‘cause mary jane’s gonna be in full mourning mode over this; and sooner or later, the nay nay who handles the rooms will get hit with an order to box up these losers and stash ‘em away; and you think a nay nay can spot cash and not swipe a bit of it?”

“your head’s back on track, duke,” says the king, fumbling in under the curtain a couple feet from where i was. i stuck tight to the wall, super still even though i was shakin’, wonderin’ what these dudes would say if they caught me—and thinkin’ hard about what i’d do if that happened. but the king grabbed the bag before i could even think a half-thought, with zero suspicion that i was lurkin’. they stuffed the bag through a rip in the straw tick under the feather-bed, jammin’ it in about a foot or two of straw, and declared it all set—‘cause a nay nay only handles the feather-bed and only flips the straw tick like twice a year, so it wasn’t in any real danger of gettin’ jacked.

but yo, i knew better. i jetted that bag out before they even hit halfway downstairs. i fumbled my way to my cubby and stashed it until i could score a better hide. figured i’d even move it outside the crib somewhere, ‘cause if they missed it, they’d tear the place up for sure—and i knew that from way back. then i crashed for the night, still cladded up; but sleep was not an option, i was sweatin’ bullets to wrap this biz up. before long, i heard the king and duke roll back up; so i slid off my pallet, leaned my chin on top of my ladder, and waited on action. but nada went down.

so i stuck it out until all the late-night noise died and the early mornin’ vibes hadn’t kicked in; then i slipped down the ladder.

chapter xxvii.

i crept up to their doors, all stealth mode, ears on deck—they were snorin’ hardcore. so i tiptoed like a boss, sliding downstairs smooth. not a peep was comin’ from anywhere. i peeped through a slim crack in the dinin’-room door and spotted the dudes watchin’ the corpse, asleep in their chairs. the door into the parlor—where the corpse was chillin’—was open and lit by a candle in both rooms. i strolled through, noticed that in the parlor it was just peter’s leftover crew, so i slid on by; but the front door was locked, and the key was nowhere to be found. just then, i heard footsteps comin’ down behind me. i bolted back into the parlor, did a quick scan, and the only legit spot to hide the bag was in the coffin. the lid was propped up about a foot, exposin’ the dead man’s face with a wet cloth draped over it and his shroud on. i carefully tucked the money-bag under the lid, just below where his hands were crossed—so cold it gave me the creeps—and then i dashed back across the room, slid behind the door for cover.

turns out the one comin’ was mary jane. she approached the coffin all gentle-like, knelt down to peek inside; then she lifted her handkerchief, and i peeped that she started cryin’, even though i couldn’t hear her over the silence, with her back turned to me. i slipped out, and as i passed the dinin’-room, i peeped through the crack to make sure the watchers hadn’t clocked me; everything was chill—they hadn’t stirred a bit.

i slinked back to bed, feelin’ ruther blue ‘cause after all that effort and mad risk, the whole thing played out like a dumpster fire. i thought, if it stays where it is, it’s all gravy; ‘cause when we dip down the river a hundred miles or so, i can drop mary jane a letter, and she can come through and snag it; but that ain’t the move that’s gonna go down—the real deal is, the cash will eventually be found when they come to screw down that coffin lid. then the king’s gonna grab it back, and it’ll be a long day before he gives anyone another shot to swipe it. of course, i wanted to slide down and grab it outta there, but i didn’t even try—‘cause every minute it was gettin’ lighter, and soon enough one of those watchers might stir, and i’d get busted—with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hired me to handle. i ain’t tryna get mixed up in that shady biz, i told myself.

when i came downstairs in the mornin’, the parlor was locked up and the watchers had dipped. it was just the fam, widow bartley, and our crew. i peeped their faces, tryin’ to suss if any drama had gone down, but i couldn’t really tell.

around midday, the undertaker rolled in with his man, and they placed the coffin smack in the middle of the room on a couple chairs; then they lined up all our chairs in rows, borrowin’ extra from the neighbors till the hall, parlor, and dinin’-room were packed. i peeped that the coffin lid was the same as before, but i didn’t dare check underneath with people all around.

then peeps started to flock in, and the boys and girls snagged front-row seats at the head of the coffin; for like half an hour, everyone shuffled in single file, takin’ a minute to stare at the dead man’s face, with some droppin’ a tear—it was mad still and solemn, with only the girls and boys clutchin’ hankies to their eyes, heads bowed, and low-key sobbin’. nothin’ but the scrape of feet on the floor and some nose-blowin’—‘cause people blow their noses more at a funeral than anywhere else except church.

once the spot was packed, the undertaker glided around in his black gloves with his soft, smooth moves, addin’ final touches, arrangin’ the peeps and stuff all ship-shape and comfy, makin’ not a peep—like a stealthy cat. he never opened his trap; he just maneuvered people around, squeezed in the latecomers, opened up passageways—all done with nods and hand signs. then he parked himself against the wall. seriously, he was the softest, glidiest, stealthiest dude i’ve ever seen; and his smile was rarer than a ham’s grin.

they’d borrowed this dope melodeum—and when everything was set, a young woman sat down and busted it out. it was all screeky and colicky, and everyone jumped in to sing, with peter bein’ the only one really on point, in my humble opinion. then the reverend hobson kicked off his sermon, slow and solemn, startin’ to speak; and straight away, out in the cellar, the wildest commotion ever erupted—a dog, no cap, but this dog made a crazy racket non-stop; the parson had to stand over the coffin and wait—it was so loud you couldn’t even think straight. total awkwardness, and nobody knew what to do. but real quick, that long-legged undertaker flashed a sign at the preacher like, “don’t sweat it—i got you.” then he stooped down and glided along the wall, with only his shoulders peekin’ above the crowd. so he kept glidin’, while the noise and madness escalated; and finally, after circlin’ two sides of the room, he dipped down into the cellar. then in like two seconds, we heard a whack, and the dog finished with a couple insane howls, and then everything went dead silent, and the parson picked up his solemn talk right where he left off. a minute or two later, the undertaker’s back and shoulders were slidin’ along the wall again; he glided around three sides of the room, then straightened up, covered his mouth with his hands, stretched his neck out past the preacher over everyone’s heads, and in a low, raw whisper said, “he had a rat!” then he drooped and slid back to his spot along the wall. you could tell the crowd was hyped and satisfied, ‘cause naturally, they were dyin’ to know. a little tidbit like that don’t cost a dime, and it’s the small moves that make a guy respected and loved. there wasn’t a more popular dude in town than that undertaker.

so, the funeral sermon was on point but damn long and straight-up tiresome; then the king cut in with his usual trash talk, and finally the show wrapped up, with the undertaker sneakin’ up on the coffin with his screwdriver. i was stressin’ and sweatin’ stiff, watchin’ him close as he slid the lid down soft like mush, screwed it shut tight and fast. so there i was! i had no clue if the cash was still in there or not. i thought, “yo, maybe somebody swiped that bag on the low—now how am i supposed to know if i should hit up mary jane or not? suppose she digs it up and finds nada, what would she think of me?” damn, i figured, i might get hunted down and locked up; better to play it low-key, stay dark, and not hit her up at all. this whole mess is a total clusterfuck now; every move to fix it just made it worse a hundred times, and i seriously wish i’d let it be and just dipped out of the whole biz.

they buried him, then we rolled back home, and i started readin’ faces again—I just couldn’t help it, and i couldn’t get no rest. but nothing went down; the faces didn’t spill any tea.

that evenin’, the king swung by and schmoozed everyone, gettin’ all friendly and sweet. he dropped a hint that his congregation back in england would go off if they caught wind of him, so he had to hustle, settle up the estate real quick, and dip out for home. he was mad sorry about bein’ rushed, and everyone felt the same—they wished he could hang longer, but it just wasn’t in the cards. and he said he and william would scoop up the girls and take ‘em home; that got everyone hyped too, ‘cause then the girls would be set with their fam; and the girls themselves were all in—it tickled them so much they forgot they’d ever had any drama—and they told him to sell out as fast as he wanted, they’d be ready. those poor souls were so happy it hurt my heart to see ‘em get played and lied to, but i saw no safe move to step in and flip the script.

and yo, if it wasn’t for the king, he went ahead and tagged the house, the nay nay, and all the property for auction on the spot—sale went down two days after the funeral; though anyone could drop a private bid before if they wanted.

so the next day after the funeral, around noon, the girls’ vibe got hit with the first major shock. a couple of nay nay traders rolled up, and the king flipped them the nay nays on a chill three-day draft deal, and off they bounced – the two bros cruisin’ up the river to memphis, and their mama takin’ the low ride down to orleans. i was like, bro, those girls were straight heartbroken, and i knew the nay nays would have them all emo over grief; they were bawlin’ all over each other, and it had me feelin’ hella sick just peepin’ that mess. the girls were shook – they never in a million years thought they’d see their fam split or sold outta town. i still can’t shake that image of those poor, miserable girls and nay nays clingin’ to each other and cryin’ like lost sims; i swear, i wouldn’t have lasted a minute if i hadn’t known the whole sale was total cap and the nay nays would slide back home in a week or two.

that whole chaos set off a massive stir in town, and a bunch of folks, all basic and flatfooted, started hollerin’ about how scandalous it was to split a mama and her kids like that. it ruffled some of the scammer crew’s feathers; but the old dummy just kept on truckin’, no matter what the duke could throw at him—and i tell ya, the duke was straight-up uneasy, no cap.

next day was auction day, for real. bright and early in the morning, the king and the duke rolled up into the garret and yanked me awake, and i could tell by their mad serious looks that trouble was brewin’. the king kicked it off:

“was you in my room night before last?”

i shot back, “no, your majesty,” – that’s always how i talked to him when just our gang was around.

“was you in there yisterday er last night?”

“no, your majesty.”

“honor bright, now—no lies.”

“honor bright, your majesty, i’m tellin’ you the truth. i ain’t been anywhere near your room since miss mary jane rolled through with you and the duke and gave you the grand tour.”

the duke jumped in, “have you seen anybody else go in there?”

“no, your grace, as far as i can peep, i don’t recall anyone else poppin’ in.”

“stop and think.”

i paused, scoped the sitch, and then said, “yo, i peeped the nay nays roll in there several times.”

both of them practically jumped, lookin’ like they never saw that coming – or maybe they did, lowkey.

then the duke fired off, “what, all of them?”

“na, not all at once – i never clock the whole squad comin’ out at the same time, just one by one.”

“hello! when was that?”

“it was on funeral day, bruh. in the morning – not super early ‘cause i overslept. i was just slidin’ down the ladder when i caught 'em.”

“go on, go on! what did they even do? how’d they act?”

“they didn’t really do any drama. they were quiet AF, tiptoeing out. i clocked that they probably snuck in to do a quick glow-up on your majesty’s room, thinkin’ you were awake; then they peeped that you were still knocked out, and they tried slidin’ out without causin’ a major vibe check – if they hadn’t already accidentally woke you up.”

“damn, this is lit!” the king exclaimed, and both of ‘em looked hella shook and kinda goofy. they just stood there, deep in thought and scratchin’ their heads for a minute, and then the duke let out a raspy chuckle and said:

“yo, it does beat all how neat the nay nays played their hand. they fronted like they were mad sorry to be bouncin’ outta this region! i legit believed they were, and so did you, and so did everybody. don’t ever tell me again that a nay nay ain’t got any theatrical flair. the way they pulled that act, it could fool anybody. in my opinion, there’s pure gold in ‘em. if i had the stacks and a theater, i wouldn’t want a slicker layout than that – and here we are, flippin’ ‘em away for pocket change. and yo, they ain’t even dropped the performance yet. so, where’s that “song” – i mean, that draft?”

“it’s in the bank, just waitin’ to be cashed,” the king replied. “where else would it be?”

“well, that’s cool then, thank goodness.”

i ventured, “yo, is something majorly off?”

the king snapped, “none of your business! keep your head in the game and mind your own affairs – if you got any. while you’re in this town, don’t you ever forget that, you hear?” then he leaned over to the duke, “we just gotta keep it on the down-low and say nothing: mum’s the word.”

as they started slidin’ down the ladder, the duke snickered again and said, “fast flips and micro-profits – it’s a killer hustle, yes.”

the king snapped back at him, “i was tryna secure the bag by sellin’ ’em out so quick. if the profits turn out to be zilch, lacking big time, is it on me any more than it’s on you?”

“well, they’d still be chillin’ in this crib, and we wouldn’t be dealin’ with all this mess if y’all had peeped my advice.”

the king clapped back as safe as he could muster, then pivoted and came after me hard. he tore into me for not comin’ in and spillin’ that i saw the nay nays sneak out of his room all sus-like – like any fool would’ve clocked that somethin’ was off. then he marched off, cussin’ up his own vibe and blamin’ himself for not sleepin’ in and catchin’ his natural chill that morning, swearin’ he’d never let it happen again.

they bounced off jawin’ at each other, and i was mad relieved i had unloaded all that drama on the nay nays without actually hurtin’ them.

chapter xxviii.

before long, it was wake-up time. i slid down the ladder and started cruisin’ downstairs; but as i hit the girls’ room, the door was wide open, and i peeped mary jane chillin’ by her old hair trunk – which was left open with her packin’ up her stuff, gettin’ ready to jet off to england. but then she stopped, a folded gown in her lap, with her face buried in her hands, cryin’ like she’d just been canceled hard.

i felt hella bad seein’ that – i mean, who wouldn’t? i stepped in and was like, “miss mary jane, u straight up can’t handle seein’ people in deep trouble, and neither can i – spill the tea.”

so she went off, and of course, it was all ‘bout the nay nays – i wasn’t surprised one bit. she said the dope trip to england was completely ruined for her; she had no clue how she’d ever vibe out there, knowin’ that her mama and the kiddos would never get to link up again – then she exploded with bitterness, throwin’ her hands up and cryin’, “oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t ever gonna see each other again!”

“but they will – for real, within two weeks – i know it!” i shot back.

damn, it all spilled out before i could even process! and before i could move, she wrapped her arms around my neck and practically demanded, “say it again, say it again, say it again!”

i realized i’d gone off too quick and dropped too much tea, and now i was in a tight spot. i asked her, “give me a sec to think,” and she sat there all hyped up and impatient, kinda cute yet oddly chill, like someone who just had a tooth yanked.

so i sat there deep in thought, thinkin’ to myself, “yo, someone who drops the truth when the heat’s on is takin’ a huge risk – even though i ain’t exactly experienced that, it looks like truth might actually be safer than a lie.” i knew i had to mull it over, ‘cause it was mad weird and off the regular grid. i’d never seen anything like it before, but then i was like, “imma just chance it; i’ll go ahead and tell the truth this time, even though it feels like sittin’ on a keg of powder and lightin’ it just to see where it blows.”

so i goes, “miss mary jane, is there any spot outta town where u could crash for like three or four days?”

“yes; mr. lothrop’s,” she replied, “why?”

“never mind the why for now. if i drop the full deets on how i know the nay nays will for real reconnect in under two weeks – right here in this house – and show you the receipts, will u hit up mr. lothrop’s and crash there for four days?”

“four days?!” she goes, “i’d be down to stay a year!”

“alright, i just need your word – nothing extra. i’d rather have that than snag another dude’s kiss-the-bible routine.” she smiled and blushed all sweet, and i added, “if u don’t mind, imma shut that door and bolt it.”

i then headed back and sat down again, continuing, “don’t freak out. just chill and toughen up, miss mary – i gotta drop some hard truths on u, and it’s gonna hit mad rough, but there’s no other way. your uncles aren’t really your uncles; they’re just a couple of lame frauds – straight-up deadbeats. okay, that’s the worst of it outta the way; u can handle the rest, mid-level style.”

of course, that hit her hard; but i was past the shallow end, so i kept on droppin’ every scoop – from when we first clapped that young fool head over heels at the steamboat, all the way to when she literally dove onto the king’s chest at the front door and got like sixteen or seventeen smooches – then she bounced up, her face all lit like a sunset, and declared:

“that brute! yo, don’t waste a minute – not even a second – we’re gonna get them tarred and feathered, then chucked in the river!”

i replied, “for sure. but do you mean before you head to mr. lothrop’s, or—?”

“oh, what was i even thinking?!” she quickly retracted, sittin’ back down. “please, don’t hold it against me – u won’t, right?” she laid her silky hand on mine in that way that i’d die for. “i was so triggered, i never imagined,” she admitted, “now go on, and i won’t get so wound up again. just tell me what u want done, and i’m all in.”

“yo,” i said, “these two lame frauds are a rough crew, and i’m stuck ridin’ with them a bit longer, whether i like it or not – i ain’t droppin’ the deets on why; and if u were to snitch on them, this town would totally get me out of their clutches, but then some other dude, who u don’t even know, would be in deep trouble. we gotta save him, right? of course. so, we’re not gonna rat on them.”

droppin’ that talk sparked a major idea in my brain. i figured maybe i could sneak a move to get me and jim off the hook with these frauds – lock ‘em up and dip out. but i wasn’t about to ride the raft in broad daylight with just me answerin’ questions, so i held off the plan until late tonight. then i goes, “miss mary jane, here’s the play: u won’t have to crash at mr. lothrop’s for long. how far out is it?”

“it’s a little short of four miles—straight out in the boonies.”

“cool, that works. now, bounce over there and hunker down till like nine or half past tonight, then get someone to scoop you up and bring you back – just say u cooked up a genius idea. if u get here before eleven, toss a candle in the window; and if i don’t show up by eleven, it means i’m ghost – out of sight and safe. then u roll out, spread the word, and get these deadbeats locked up.”

“bet, i’ll do it,” she agreed.

“and if it so happens that i don’t manage to dip and end up gettin’ hauled in with them, u gotta have my back and say i dropped the full deets beforehand – and stick by me with everything u got.”

“stand by you? hell yeah i will. they ain’t even allowed to mess with a strand of your hair!” she declared, her nostrils flaring and her eyes snapping with conviction.

“if i get away, i won’t be here to prove that these clowns aren’t really your uncles – i couldn’t pull it off if i stuck around. i swear they’re just a bunch of deadbeats, but that still means somethin’. there are others who can handle this better than me, and they won’t get doubted as quick as i would. i’ll hook you up with their deets. gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. write this down: ‘royal nonesuch, bricksville.’ stash it safe and don’t lose it. when the court wants dirt on these two, tell ‘em to roll up to bricksville and say they got the squad that rocked the royal nonesuch, and ask for witnesses – u’ll have the whole town down here faster than u can blink, miss mary. and they’ll be comin’ in droves too.”

i figured we had our plan locked in. so i continued, “just let the auction roll on, and don’t sweat it. nobody’s gotta pay for what they snag until a full day after the auction – that short notice means they gotta stick around until they get their cash; and as we’ve set it up, the sale don’t even count, and they ain’t pocketin’ any money. it’s just like with the nay nays – it was never a real sale, and the nay nays will be slidin’ back before long. they can’t even cash in on that money yet – they’re stuck in the worst kind of fix, miss mary.”

“well,” she said, “i’ll bounce down to breakfast now, and then i’m headin’ straight for mr. lothrop’s.”

“nah, that ain’t the move, miss mary jane,” i snapped, “no way – u gotta dip before breakfast.”

“why?”

“what did u even think i wanted you to roll for, miss mary?”

“i never really knew – come to think of it, i got no clue. what was it?”

“yo, it’s ‘cause u ain’t one of these tough leather-face types. i don’t need a fancy script when your face already drops all the tea. can u really face your uncles when they roll up to give u their morning smooches, and never—”

“stop, stop! yes, i’ll bounce before breakfast – i’m down for that. but what about leavin’ my sisters with them?”

“yeah; never mind ‘em. they gotta tough it out a bit longer. if all of y’all left together, folks might start sniffin’ something off. i don’t want u seein’ your sisters or anyone else in this town; if a neighbor asks how your uncles are doin’ this morning, your face will spill the tea. no, just bounce on out, miss mary jane, and i’ll handle it all. i’ll tell miss susan to give your uncles your lovin’ and say you dipped for a few hours to chill, get a fresh look, or catch a friend – and you’ll be back tonight or early tomorrow.”

“bouncin’ to see a friend is cool, but i’m not down with my love goin’ to them.”

“alright then, it won’t happen.” it was cool lettin’ her know – no harm, no foul. it’s just a little move, no big drama; sometimes the little moves smooth out the ride the best down here. it’d help mary jane chill, and it wouldn’t cost a dime.

then i goes, “there’s one more thing – that bag of cash.”

“well, they got that; and it makes me feel kinda goofy thinkin’ ‘bout how they scored it,” she replied.

“nah, you’re off – they don’t got it.”

“so who’s holdin’ it then?”

“i wish i knew, but i don’t. i had it ‘cause i jacked it from them – and i jacked it to hook you up; i know exactly where i stashed it, but i’m afraid it ain’t there no more. i’m mad sorry, miss mary jane, i’m as sorry as i can be; but i did the best i could – i kept it 100. i nearly got caught, so i had to dump it in the first spot i hit and then jet – and that spot was def not chill.”

“oh, stop blaming yourself – it’s rough but you couldn’t help it; it ain’t your fault. so, where’d you hide it?”

i didn’t wanna drag her back into all that mess, and i just couldn’t drop the deets about that deadbeat corpse lyin’ in the coffin with that bag of cash chillin’ on his stomach. so i stayed quiet for a minute; then i goes,

“i’d rather not spill where i dropped it, miss mary jane, if u can cut me some slack; but imma write it down for u on a piece of paper, and u can peep it along the road to mr. lothrop’s, cool?”

“oh, yes,” she replied.

so i scribbled, “i put it in the coffin. it was in there when you were bawlin’ in the night. i was chillin’ behind the door, and i was hella sorry for you, miss mary jane.”

it made my eyes water a bit thinkin’ ‘bout her cryin’ all alone that night, with those skeezy devils lurkin’ under her roof, shamin’ and jacking her; and when i folded that note up and handed it to her, i saw tears wellin’ in her eyes too; then she grabbed my hand hard and said,

“good-bye. i’m gonna do everythin’ exactly as you said; and if i never see you again, i won’t ever forget you – i’ll think of you a million times and pray for you, fr!”

and just like that, she bounced.

pray for me! i figured if she really knew me, she'd land a gig way more her vibe. but i bet she did it anyway—she was just that kind. she had the guts to pray for judus if the mood hit her – there’s no backin’ down with her, i swear. you can call it flattery, but honestly, she had more grit than any girl i’ve ever seen; she was just packed with strength. and when it comes to beauty – and pure goodness too – she outshines ‘em all. i haven’t seen her since she dipped out that door; like, i haven’t peeped her again, but i swear i’ve thought about her a million times and remembered her promise to pray for me; and if i ever thought prayin’ for her would boost me, damn, i’d have done it or busted tryin’.

so mary jane dipped out the back way, i reckon, ‘cause nobody even clocked her leavin’. when i ran into susan and the hare-lip, i goes,

“what’s the name of that crew on the other side of the river that y’all sometimes go see?”

they replied, “there’s a few, but mainly it’s the proctors.”

“ah, that’s it – i almost forgot. well, miss mary jane told me to let y’all know she bounced over there in a mad hurry – one of them’s hella sick.”

“which one?”

“i don’t know; i kinda blanked, but i think it’s—”

“sakes alive, i hope it ain’t hanner?”

“i’m sorry to say it,” i go, “but hanner’s the very one.”

“my goodness, and she was all lit just last week! is she super wrecked?”

“ain’t no fancy term for it. they hung with her all night, miss mary jane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.”

“damn, think about that now! what’s the sitch with her?”

i couldn’t come up with a solid reason off the bat, so i goes, “mumps.”

“mumps your granny! they don’t mess with peeps havin’ the mumps.”

“they don’t, right? but bet your boots, they do with these mumps. these mumps are on another level – a whole new flex, miss mary jane said.”

“how is it even a new kind?”

“‘cause it’s all mixed up with other stuff.”

“like what other stuff?”

“well, measles, whooping-cough, erysiplas, consumption, yellow janders, brain fever, and whoever knows what else, all tossed in the mix.”

“my land! and they still call it mumps?”

“that’s what miss mary jane said.”

“so like, why the heck do they even call it mumps?”

“yo, ‘cause it is mumps. that’s just how it starts.”

“man, that makes zero sense. someone could stub his toe, slip on some random shit, fall down a well, break his neck, bust his brains out, and some idiot comes along and goes, ‘oh, he stubbed his toe’ – would that even be logical? nope. and likewise, this whole mumps biz don’t add up. you feel me?”

“is it catching on? like, what are you even sayin’? it’s like tryin’ to catch a harrow in the dark. if u ain’t lockin’ onto one tooth, u’re bound to snag another, right? and u can’t just dip one tooth without hauling the whole harrow along, can u? basically, this kind of mumps is like one big harrow – and it ain’t no weak sauce when it’s hitched on proper.”

“man, this is awful, i think,” the hare-lip mumbled. “i’ll bounce to uncle harvey and—”

“oh, heck yes,” i replied, “i definitely would. i wouldn’t waste no time.”

“but why wouldn’t u?”



yo, peep this for a sec, and maybe it'll hit ya. ain't your uncles on a turbo ride back to england, like, asap? and fr, do you seriously think they'd dip out and leave you to ghost on that crazy road trip alone? obvi they got you on lock, no cap. they got mad chill vibes, so it's all gucci. your uncle harvey's a preacher, right? facts. aight, so here's the tea: is a preacher gonna scam a steamboat clerk? or hustle a ship clerk? all for the sake of letting miss mary jane hop on board? obviously he ain't about that scam life. so what's his move? he'll be like, "big oof, it's super tragic, but my church biz has gotta roll out extra fast; cuz my niece just caught that nasty pluribus-unum mumps vibe, and i gotta chill here for three whole months to peep if she caught it." but yo, if you think spilling the tea to uncle harvey is the move—

bruh, why we still clownin' around here when we could be living it up in england, chillin' while waiting to peep if mary jane got that nastiness or nah? lowkey, you sound like such a dweeb.

anyways, maybe spill the tea to some of the squad next door, ya feel?

yo, listen up. you legit win the crown for straight-up raw dumb. can't you peep that they'd totally snitch? the only smart move is to keep it 100 and not tell a single soul.

ok, maybe you're on point—facts, i vibe that you're right.

but i figure we gotta slide that info to uncle harvey, like, she dipped for a bit so he ain't gonna be all sus about her?

yeah, mary jane was down with that. she dropped a line: "tell 'em to send uncle harvey and william my vibes and a smooch, and mention that i bounced over the river to peep mr.—mr. who? what was the name of that bougie fam your uncle peter was always hyped about? like, the one that—"

dude, you probs mean the apthorps, right?

yeppers; those fancy names always mess with your brain, like you can barely recall 'em half the time. she lowkey said she bounced over to bug the apthorps into coming through at the auction to cop the crib, cuz she was dead sure uncle peter would rather have 'em bag it than anyone else; and she's gonna stick on 'em till they finally agree, and then, if she's not too beat, she'll bounce home, and if she is, she'll slide in the morning anyway. she said, "keep it on the down-low about the proctors, only mention the apthorps"—which is totes legit, cuz she's going there to drop the deets about them copping the house; i got the memo straight from her.

aight, they peaced out to crash with their uncles, send major love and smooches, and spill the deets.

everything was chill now. the girls stayed mad quiet since they were hyped on england vibes; plus the king and the duke were lowkey preferring mary jane to be on that auction grind instead of hanging with doctor robinson. i was vibing majorly; felt like i had flexed pretty neat—no cap, even tom sawyer probably couldn't've mic'd it up any cleaner. sure, he might've dropped extra sauce, but i ain't wired for that drip.

so they threw down the auction in the public square, like, late in the arvo, and it just dragged on and on, while the old dude was chillin' up next to the auctioneer, looking all zen and proper, dropping some scripture vibes or preppy inspo quotes every now and then, and the duke was out there fishing for clout like he had zero chill, always flexin' his goo-goo vibes.

but eventually the saga dragged on, and everything got snapped up—except a tiny lil’ lot in the graveyard. so they had to hustle that off, and i never peeped a more extra flex from the king, mad hungry to gobble up all the cash. meanwhile, as they were vibing, a steamboat landed, and within a hot two minutes a wild mob crashed in, yelling, laughing, making mad noise, and straight-up singing:

"here’s your opposition line! here’s your two sets o’ heirs to old peter wilks—and you pays your money and you takes your choice!"

chapter xxix.

so they rolled up a super fly old gentleman and a sharp young buck, rockin' a sling on his right arm. fr, the crowd was going off with yells and laughs non-stop. but i wasn’t catching any meme vibe from it, and i figured it’d stress out the duke and king if they actually peeped the joke. i figured they'd turn ghost-white. but nah, not a soul did. the duke played it cool, actin' all clueless, just vibin' for clout like a jug that's straight spillin' buttermilk; and as for the king, he just kept starin' all sorrowed at the new peeps, like it twisted his insides thinkin' such scammy frauds and rascals could exist. damn, he was on point. mad heads gathered around him, lettin' him know they were his ride-or-die crew. that old gent who just dropped in looked hella confuzzled. pretty soon, he started droppin' lines, and i peeped he was channelin' straight english vibes—not exactly king style, tho the king’s own tryin' was pretty decent for an imitation. i can’t drop his exact words, but he flipped to the crowd and went something like:

"yo, this is a total plot twist i did not expect; gotta be straight-up real here, i'm not fully dialed in to handle this tea right now; me and my bro have been hit with major bad juju—he busted his arm, and our swag got left behind in some mix-up town last night. i'm peter wilks' bro harvey, and this here's his bro william, who basically can't hear or speak—and like, can barely sign, cuz he's rockin' just one hand. we’re legit who we say we are; in like one or two days, when i snag our baggage, i can show the receipts. but til then, imma bounce to the hotel and chill."

so that dude and the new dummy bounced; and the king cracked up, spittin' his crazy banter:

"busted his arm—lowkey, right?—mad convenient for a fraudster who’s gotta whip out signs but never got schooled on it. dropped their baggage! that's hella dope!—and super ingenious on the situ, facts!"

so he bust out laughing again; and honestly, everyone else was laughing too, 'cept like three or four, or maybe half a dozen. one of 'em was that doc; another was this sharp dude rockin' an old-school carpet-bag fresh off the steamboat, low-key whisperin' to him and peepin' the king now and then—yup, it was levi bell, the lawyer who bailed up to louisville; and another was a big, burly dude who rolled in and soaked up every word the old gent dropped, also tunin' in to the king. then, when the king wrapped up, this burly dude stepped up and went:

"yo, listen up; if you are harvey wilks, when’d you roll into this town?"

"the day before the funeral, bro," replies the king.

"but like, what time of day?"

"in the evenin'—like, about an hour or two pre-sunset."

"how'd you even roll in?"

"i came down on the susan powell from cincinnati."

"so then, how'd you end up at the pint in the mornin'—in a canoe?"

"i wasn’t even at the pint in the mornin'."

"that's cap."

a bunch of 'em jumped on him, beggin' him not to talk that smack to an old dude and a preacher.

"preacher, damn, dude's a fraud and a liar. he was legit at the pint that mornin'. i live up there, right? so listen, i was there too, and he was there. i saw him, no doubt. he rocked up in a canoe, with tim collins and some kid."

then the doc piped up:

"yo, hines, would you peep the boy if you saw him again?"

he straight-up pointed at me. then the doc went:

"neighbors, i ain't sure if this new duo is scammin' or not; but if these two ain't frauds, then i'm straight-up an idiot, period. i think we gotta lock 'em down until we get the full tea. come on, hines; all of y'all, roll up. we're gonna haul these dudes to the tavern, confront 'em with the other crew, and i bet we'll uncover some truths before long."

it was total chaos for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s peeps; so we all bounced. it was about sundown. the doc grabbed my hand, all kind and careful, but he never let go.

we all crashed into this massive hotel room, lit some candles, and hauled in the new duo. first, the doc went:

"i don't wanna harsh on these dudes too much, but i lowkey think they're scammin' and might've got sidekicks we ain't clued in on. and yo, if they do, won't those accomplices just dip with that bag of gold peter wilks left behind? for real. and if these guys are legit, they won't mind callin' up for that cash and lettin' us hold onto it until they prove the receipts—facts, right?"

everyone was down with that. so i figured our crew was officially in a tight jam from the jump. but the king just wore a sorrowful face and went:

"yo, gents, i wish the money was there, cuz i ain't feelin' about droppin' any coin for a full-on, transparent investigation on this whack biz; but, dude, the money's ghost; go on, check if you want."

"so, where's that cash at then?"

"well, here's the tea: when my niece handed me the bag to hold for her, i stashed it in the straw tick of my bed, not wantin' to bank it for the few days we were chillin' here, and i figured the bed was a safe zone, since we're not really used to nay nay, and supposin' 'em honest like english servants. but lowkey, the nay nay jacked it the very next mornin' right after i hit the stairs; and when i sold 'em, i hadn't even peeped the money, so they dipped with it clean. my servant here can drop the deets, gents."

the doc and a bunch were like "shucks!" and i could tell no one was dissin' him. one dude asked me if i witnessed the nay nay jack it. i was like, "nah, but i peeped 'em sneakin' out on the low, hustlin' away, and i didn't give it much thought—figured they were scared they woke my boss and were bouncin' before he snapped." that was all they were trippin' about. then the doc spun on me and said:

"you english too, or what?"

i was like, "yes," and he and a few others cracked up, droppin' a "stuff!"

well, then they dove headfirst into this mad investigation, goin' up and down hour after hour, and not a soul even mentioned supper—it was totally off the radar—and so they kept pushin' it, non-stop; it was the wildest, most jumbled mess ever. they made the king drop his yarn, and forced the old gent to spill his too; and honestly, only a bunch of snobby, biased clowns would miss that the old gent was droppin' straight truth while the other was full of cap. before long, they hauled me up to spill what i knew. the king shot me a shady left-handed glance, so i knew it was cool to drop the real tea. i started rapping about sheffield, how we were livin' our best there, and the lowdown on the english wilkses and all that; but i didn't really get goin' until the doc busted out laughing; and then levi bell, that lawyer, said:

"set down, my boy; wouldn't wanna strain myself if i were you. i reckon you ain't used to lying—it's not your jam; what you need is some serious practice. you're doin' it mad awkward."

i wasn't even trippin' about the props, but lowkey, i was stoked to get off that heat.

the doc was about to drop more, then spun and said:

"if you had been in town from the jump, levi bell—"

the king cut in, reachin' out his hand and goin':

"yo, is this my late bro's old homie he used to hype up so much?"

the lawyer and the king shook hands, and the lawyer grinned all smug while they chatted for a bit, then slid aside to whisper; finally, the lawyer spoke up and said:

"that’s gonna settle it. imma take the order and send it, along with your bro's, and then everyone will know it's straight-up legit."

so they grabbed some paper and a pen, and the king leaned his head to one side, chewed his tongue, and scribbled down some deets; then they passed the pen to the duke—and for real, the duke looked hella off—but he grabbed the pen and jotted something. then the lawyer turned to the new old gent and said:

"yo, you and your bro, drop a line or two and sign your names, aight?"

the old gent scribbled his part, but honestly, no one could read his dribble. the lawyer looked mega shook and said:

"well, it beats me"—and he pulled a bunch of old letters from his pocket, eyeballed 'em, then checked the old gent’s scribbles, and back to the letters; then he went on, "these vintage letters are from harvey wilks; and peep these two different handwritings—any sober person can tell these weren't penned by him" (i swear, the king and the duke looked straight sold and clownish seein' how the lawyer had 'em), "and check out this old gent’s scrawl—anyone can tell he didn't even write it proper. now, here's some letters from—"

the new old gent cut in, "if you don't mind, lemme break it down. only my bro can read my scribbles—so he copies for me. what you’re lookin' at is his hand, not mine."

"well!" said the lawyer, "this is wild. i got some of william’s letters too; so if you can get him to drop a line or two so we can com—"

"he can't write with his left hand," the old gent interjected. "if he could rock his right, you'd see he penned his own letters and mine as well. peep both—they're by the same hand, no cap."

the lawyer wrapped it up and said, "i believe that's the move—and if not, there's a hella stronger vibe than i noticed anyway. well, well, well! i thought we were on track for a fix, but it's kinda gone haywire, tbh. but yo, one thing's clear: these two ain't even either of the wilkses," he waved his head toward the king and the duke.

yo, what do y'all think? that muleheaded old fool wasn't gonna cave then! indeed, he wouldn't. he claimed it wasn't a fair test, sayin' his bro william was the ultimate prankster who never even tried writin'—like, william was plannin' one of his jokes the moment he grabbed a pen. so he warmed up and kept ramblin' until he nearly believed his own cap; but then the new gent jumped in and said:

"i've got a thought. is there anybody here who helped set out my bro—helped lay out the late peter wilks for his buryin'?"

"yeah," piped up somebody, "me and ab turner did it. we were both down."

then the old gent flipped toward the king and said:

"yo, maybe this dude can drop what was inked on his chest, aight?"

both of 'em replied, "we ain't peeped any mark at all."

"good!" declared the old gent. "now, what you did peep on his chest was a small, faded p, and a b (like his dropped initial from his younger days), and a w, with dashes between 'em—so: p—b—w"—and he scribbled that on a scrap. "c'mon, ain't that what you saw?"

both of 'em spoke up again, sayin', "no, we didn't. we never peeped any marks whatsoever."

well, now everyone was straight-up flipped, and they started chantin':

"the whole bilin’ of ’m ’s frauds! le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail!"

and the mob was whoopin' at once, a full-on rattlin' powwow. but then the lawyer jumped on a table and yelled:

"gentlemen—gentlemen! hear me out for a sec—just one word—if you please! there's one last move—let's go unearth the corpse and peep it up."

that got 'em hyped.

"hooray!" they all shouted, and started bouncin' off; but the lawyer and the doc quickly hollered:

"hold up, hold up! grab these four dudes and the boy, and round 'em up too!"

"we gotchu!" they all chanted; "and if we don't peep those marks, we're gonna lynch the whole crew!"

i was shook, ngl. but there was zero way out. they grabbed all of us and marched us straight down to the graveyard, like, a mile and a half down the river, with the whole town chasin' us, cuz we were makin' mad noise and it was just nine in the evenin'.

as we passed our crib, i was lowkey wishin' i hadn't sent mary jane outta town; cuz if i could've flicked her a wink, she'd have bounced and saved me, and clapped back at our dead-beats.

so, we swarmed down the river road, like wildcats on the prowl; and to make it even creepier, the sky was darkenin' up hard, lightning flashing in quick strobe, and the wind shiverin' through the leaves. this was the absolute worst, most dangerous jam i ever got into; i was legit stunned—everything was goin' so different from what i planned. instead of chillin' and takin' my time to enjoy the vibes, with mary jane ready to bail me out at a moment's notice, here i was facin' sudden death over some tattoo marks. if they didn't find those—

i couldn't even bear to think about it, but for real, i couldn't peep anything else. it only got darker and darker—a perfect time to ghost the mob—but that big husky had me by the wrist, hines, and i was as screwed as tryin' to ditch goliar. he dragged me along, so hyped and excited, that i had to sprint just to keep up.

when they rolled up, they swarmed into the graveyard like an overflow. when they hit the grave, they found they had, like, a hundred shovels, but nobody even thought to grab a lantern. still, they dived into diggin' by the flicker of lightning, and even sent someone to the nearest crib, half a mile off, to borrow one.

so they dug and dug like non-stop; it got mad dark, the rain kicked in, the wind swished heavy, lightning flashed faster and faster, and the thunder boomed like crazy; but those folks were so deep in the biz, they didn't even care—one minute you could see every face in that massive crowd and shovels of dirt flyin' out of the grave, and the next, the darkness clapped everything off so hard you couldn't peep a thing.

finally, they hauled out the coffin and started unscrewin' the lid, and then there was a wild rush of folks bumpin' and shovin', all tryin' to snag a look—it was straight-up awful in the dark. hines hurt my wrist real bad, pullin' and tuggin' so hard he almost forgot i was there, so hyped and pantin'.

suddenly, lightning dropped a perfect burst of white glare, and somebody shouted out:

by the living jingo, yo, peep that bag of gold chillin’ on his chest!

hines busted out a wild whoop, just like the whole squad, and whipped his wrist to bust his way in for a peek, while i dipped out slick in that pitch-black night – legit, no one was clockin’ my speed.

i had the road all to myself, and i was straight-up flying—like, it was all mine except for the heavy dark vibes, random glare stares, rain buzzin’ like it’s on overdrive, wind slap-happy, and thunder splitin’ the sky; no cap, i was cruisin’ like a total boss!

when i rolled into town, i peeped that nobody was out in the storm, so i didn’t waste time peepin’ any back alleys – i just humped it down the main drag; and as i got close to our crib, i scoped it out. no lights at all; the house was mad dark—which had me feelin’ some type of way, lowkey bummed out though i couldn’t put my finger on it. but then, as i was sailin’ by, bam! a flash lit up mary jane’s window, and my heart legit almost exploded; in that instant the whole house was left in the dark, ghosted for good in this world. she was the dopest babe i’d ever peeped, straight-up loaded with that extra beach vibe.

the minute i was high enough above town to see a spot for the tow-head, i started scannin’ for a boat to jack, and the first time lightning lit up a ride that wasn’t chained, i snatched it and yeeted out. it was a canoe, no cap, barely tethered with just a rope. the tow-head sat hella far out in the middle of the river, but i wasn’t about to waste a sec; and when i finally hit the raft, i was so wrecked i nearly just crashed on the spot if i could’ve taken a nap. but nah, as soon as i sprung aboard, i busted out a shout:

“out with you, jim, and set her loose! glory be to goodness, we’re done with them!”

jim dipped out and came barreling after me with his arms spread wide, super hyped; but when i caught a glimpse of him in that lightning flash, my heart did a mega flip and i flipped overboard backwards – 'cause i totally spaced that he was like a mashup of old king lear and a drowned a-rab rolled into one, and that straight-up freaked the bejesus out of me. still, jim fished me out and was about to give me a giant hug and bless me up, so stoked he was that i was back and we were clear of the king and the duke, but i was like:

“not now; treat it like your breakfast, your morning grub! let her go and slide!”

so in like two seconds, we were slidin’ down the river, and it felt so sick to be free again, just us on the big river with zero clout interference. i couldn’t help but bounce around a bit, jump up and flex my heels a few times—but on the third snap, i caught a sound i knew all too well, so i held my breath and listened; and yup, when the next flash broke over the water, there they were—already settin’ up with their oars and making their skiff hum. yeah, it was the king and the duke.

i ended up slumping hard onto the planks, feelin’ so done, barely holdin’ back the tears.

chapter xxx.

when they got aboard, the king came straight at me, shook my collar, and was like, “you trying to dip on us, huh, you little pup? tired of our squad, yo?”

i was like, “nah, your majesty, i wasn’t—please chill, your majesty!”

“quick, then, spill your plan, or imma shake your guts out!”

“honestly, i’ll tell you everything exactly as it went down, your majesty. the dude who had me on hold was super chill to me, always goin’ on about havin’ a boy as big as me who died last year, and he felt bad seein’ a kid in such a wild mess; and when everyone got totally caught off guard by that gold drop and rushed for the coffin, he dropped me and whispered, ‘hurry it up, or they’ll hang you for sure!’ so i dipped. staying just wasn’t an option—i couldn’t do a thing, and i wasn’t tryna get hung if i could bounce. so i kept on runnin’ until i snagged that canoe; and when i landed here, i told jim to hustle, or they’d catch and hang me, and i said i was scared you and the duke were already toast, which made me hella sorry, and jim was feelin’ it too, and he was super glad when we peeped you comin’; you can ask jim if you need the deets.”

jim confirmed that, and the king told him to zip it, sayin’, “oh hell yea, it's hella likely!” while shakin’ me up again, claimin’ he could’ve drowned me. but then the duke jumped in:

“leggo the boy, you old idiot! would you have done any different? did you even search for him when you got loose? i don’t remember that.”

so the king dropped me and started goin’ off on that town and everyone in it. then the duke fired back:

“yo, you better be dissin’ yourself real hard, since you deserve it the most. you haven't done a single smart move from the jump except comin’ out all cool and cheeky with that fake blue-arrow mark. that move was fire—it was straight-up bully; and it saved our butts. ’cause if it weren’t for that, they'd have locked us up until those englishmen's baggage dropped in—and then, penitentiary, no lie! but that trick took 'em straight to the graveyard, and that gold did us a major solid; 'cause if those hyped-up fools hadn't dropped all caution and rushed for a peek, we'd have been rockin’ our cravats tonight—legit cravats worth flexin’—longer than needed!”

they chilled for a minute, mullin’ it over; then the king, all zoned-out, goes, “mf! and we reckoned the nay nays stole it!”

that totally made me squirm!

“yeah,” says the duke, all slow and dripping with sarcasm, “we did.”

after about half a minute, the king drawled, “leastways, i did.”

the duke snapped back, same vibe, “on the contrary, i did.”

the king got all ruffled and says, “looky here, bilgewater, what are you referrin’ to?”

the duke snaps, “when it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what were you referrin’ to?”

“shucks!” says the king, oozing sarcasm, “but i dunno—maybe you were sleepin’ and had no idea what was up.”

the duke bristled, “oh, cut out this cursed nonsense; do you take me for a complete fool? don't you think i know who hid that money in that coffin?”

“yes, sir! i know you do know, because you done it yourself!”

“it’s a lie!”—and the duke charged. the king hollered, “take your hands off! let go of my throat! i take it all back!”

the duke fired, “well, you just own up first—that you did hide that money there, plannin’ to dip one day and slide back to scoop it all for yourself.”

“wait just a minute, duke—answer this one question, honest and fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and i'll believe you and take back everything i said.”

“you old scoundrel, i didn't, and you know i didn't. there, now!”

“well, then, i believe you. but answer me just this one more—now don't get mad; didn't you have it in your mind to grab the money and hide it?”

the duke stayed silent a bit; then he goes, “well, i don't care if i did, i didn't do it, anyway. but you not only had it in mind to do it, you did it.”

“i wish i never died if i did that, duke, and that's straight-up truth. i won't say i wasn't gonna do it, 'cause i was; but you—i mean somebody—got there before me.”

“it's a lie! you did it, and you gotta own up, or—”

the king started gurgling, then gasped, “enough! i own up!”

i was super relieved to hear him come clean; it got me way more chill than before. so the duke dropped his grip and said:

“if you ever deny it again, i'll drown you. it's totally on you to sit there and cry like a baby—it fits you, considering how you've acted. i never saw such an old dinosaur for wanting to snatch up everything—and i was trusting you like you were my own dad. you should be ashamed to let that fall on a bunch of poor nay nays without saying a word for 'em. it's ridiculous to think i was soft enough to buy that trash. damn, i can now see why you were so eager to fix the deficit—you wanted to scoop up all the money from the nonesuch and bag it for yourself, one way or another!”

the king, all timid and sniffling, said, “why, duke, it was you that said to make up the deficit; it wasn’t me.”

“dry up! i don't want to hear any more out of you!” says the duke. “and now look at what you got out of it. they've gotten all their money back, and all we got is a shekel or two extra. go to bed, and don't you ever hit me with any more deficits for as long as you live!”

so the king slipped into the wigwam and hit the bottle for comfort, and before long the duke did the same; within about half an hour, they were as thick as thieves again, gettin’ tight and lovin’ it, and ended up snorin’ in each other’s arms. they both got super mellow, but i noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget about denying he hid that money-bag again. that made me feel way more at ease and satisfied. of course, once they were snoozin’, we had a long gab session and i told jim everything.

chapter xxxi.

we didn't stop at any town for days and days; we just cruised straight down the river. we were down south in that warm weather, hella far from home. i started spotting trees draped with spanish moss, hangin’ off like long, gray beards. it was the first time i ever peeped that vibe, and it made the woods look super solemn and dismal. so the frauds figured they were outta the danger zone, and they started doin’ their village hustle again.

first, they did a lecture on temperance; but they didn't earn enough coin for either of 'em to get tipsy. then in another village, they kicked off a dance school; but they danced about as well as a kangaroo on ice, so after one lame prance the public yeeted them right outta town. another time they tried to rock some yellocution; but they didn’t get far before the crowd stood up, dropped a heavy barrage of cussing on them, and chased them off. they dabbled in missionary work, mesmerizing, doctoring, fortune-tellin’, and a bunch of oddball hustles; but nothing clicked, fam. so eventually, they went totally broke and just chilled by the raft as it floated along, mulling over their woes half a day at a time in a deep, desperate blue mood.

and eventually they switched it up and started layin’ their heads together in the wigwam, chattin’ low and on the down-low for two or three hours straight.

jim and i got real uneasy—we weren't feelin' the vibe. we figured they were plotting some seriously shady deviltry, like breakin’ into somebody’s house or store, or even divin’ into the counterfeit cash game—something wild. so we got pretty scared and made a pact that we’d never mess with that, and if we even got the slightest hint of it, we’d ghost them hard and dip out, no cap.

so, early one morning, we stashed the raft in a solid, safe spot about two miles downstream from a run-down village called pikesville, and the king hit shore and told us to stay low while he peeped around town to see if anyone had caught wind of the royal nonesuch yet. in my head, i was thinkin’, “house to rob, you mean? and when you finish robbin’ it, you’re gonna come back wonderin’ what happened to me, jim, and the raft—and you'll be left totally puzzled.”

and he said if he wasn’t back by midday, then the duke and i would know everything was cool, and we were to come along.

so we chilled where we were. the duke was freaking out and sweatin’ all over, mad sour—callin’ us out for every little mishap, and nothing we did was right; he nitpicked every move. something shady was definitely brewin’. i was hyped when midday came and the king hadn’t shown up; maybe we had a chance to flip the script—and maybe even level up our situation.

so me and the duke went up to the village, scopin’ out the king, and eventually found him in the back room of a low-key dive, all cramped up, with a bunch of loafers raggin’ on him for kicks, and he was cussin’ and threatenin’ with all his might—so messed up he couldn’t even walk or fight back.

the duke started goin’ off on him like he was an old fool, and the king fired back full-on sass; and the second they got into it, i dipped quick, shakin’ the reefs out of my legs, and tore down the river road like a deer on the run, 'cause i knew this was our chance; i decided it’d be a long day before they saw me or jim again. i got there totally winded but mad joyful, and then i shouted:

“set her loose, jim! we’re all right now!”

but there wasn’t any answer, and nobody came out of the wigwam. jim was gone! i kept hollerin’—one shout, then another—while runnin’ through the woods, whoopin’ and screechin’; but it was no good—old jim was straight-up gone. then i sat down and broke into tears; i just couldn’t help it. but i didn’t stay down too long. soon i got back on the road, tryna figure out what to do next, and i ran into a boy walkin’, so i asked him if he’d seen a strange nay nay dressed all kinds of quirky, and he goes:

“yes.”

“whereabouts?” i asked.

“down at silas phelps’ place, two miles down from here. he’s a runaway nay nay, and they got him. you lookin’ for him?”

“you bet i ain’t! i ran into him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said that if i hollered he’d cut out my livers, and told me to lay low—so i did. i've been stuck there ever since, afraid to come out.”

“well,” he says, “you don't need to be scared no more, 'cause they've got him. he ran off down south, sometimes.”

“it's a good job they got him.”

“well, i reckon! there's a two hundred dollar reward on him. it's like snaggin’ cash off the street.”

“yes, it is—and i coulda had it if i were big enough; i saw him first. who caught him?”

“it was some old dude—a stranger—and he sold his chance with him for forty dollars, 'cause he had to hit the river and couldn’t wait. think about that, man! you’d be waitin’ even if it took seven years.”

“that’s me, always,” i say. “but maybe his chance isn’t worth more if he's sellin’ it so cheap. maybe there's something shady about it.”

“but it is—straight as a string. i peeped the handbill myself. it spells out everything about him, dot for dot—paints him like a legit picture, and even tells you which plantation he's from, right below new orleans. no sirree, there ain't any fuss about that speculation, trust me. say, gimme a chaw tobacker, will ya?”

i had none, so he bounced. i returned to the raft and sat in the wigwam to think, but couldn’t figure any plan out. i racked my brain until it hurt, but i just couldn’t spot a way out of the mess. after this epic journey, and all the crazy stuff we did for those scoundrels, it all came to nothing—everything got busted and ruined—'cause they had the guts to serve jim such a trick and enslave him for life, among strangers too, all for a lame forty dollars.

once i thought to myself, it’d be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home with his family—even if he stayed a slave—than to be stuck among strangers. so i figured i'd write a letter to tom sawyer and let him know to tell miss watson where jim was. but i quickly scrapped that plan for two reasons: she'd be pissed off and grossed out by his shady, ungrateful bounce, and she'd probably just sell him down the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nay nay, and they'd make jim feel that every single day, leaving him all ornery and humiliated. and then, think of me! word would spread that huck finn helped a nay nay get his freedom; and if i ever crossed paths with anyone from that town again, i’d be ready to crawl around lickin’ their boots in shame. that's just how it goes—a person does something low-down, then he don’t wanna face the fallout, thinkin’ that as long as he can keep it hidden, it ain’t a disgrace.

that was my fix exactly. the more i dug into it, the more my conscience started grindin’ on me, and i got increasingly wicked, low-down, and ornery. and then, outta nowhere, it hit me that the plain ol’ hand of providence was smacking me in the face—letting me know that my wickedness was under constant watch from up there in heaven—while i was out here stealin’ a poor old woman’s nay nay who’d never done me no harm, and now it was showin’ me that there’s always some big presence keepin’ tabs, not gonna let this miserable business slide any further. i straight-up froze, terrified.

i did my best to ease my mind by sayin’ i was brought up wicked, so it wasn’t all on me; but deep inside, something kept whisperin’, “there’s sunday school—you coulda gone to it; and if you had, they’d have schooled you that anyone actin’ like you with that nay nay is headed straight for everlasting fire.” 

that made me shiver. i almost made up my mind to pray, to try and stop bein’ that messed-up kid and do better. so i knelt down, but the words just wouldn’t come. why wouldn’t they? it wasn’t like i could hide this from him or from myself. i knew exactly why—they were blocked ‘cause my heart wasn’t in the right place; i wasn’t square; i was straight-up double-dealin’. i was pretendin’ to give up sin, but deep down, i was clingin’ to the biggest sin of them all. i was tryna force my mouth to say i’d do the right, clean thing, and go write to that nay nay’s owner to report his whereabouts; but deep down, i knew it was a lie, and he knew it, too. you can’t pray a lie—I learned that the hard way.

so i was drowning in trouble, all kinds of stressed, not knowin’ what to do. finally, i had an idea; i said, i’ll go write that letter—and then see if i can pray. man, it was wild how light i felt immediately, like a feather, with all my problems disappearin’. so i grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil, totally stoked, and sat down to write:

“miss watson, your runaway nay nay jim is down here two miles below pikesville, and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.

huck finn.”

i felt amazing, totally washed clean of sin for the first time in my life, and i knew i could pray now. but i didn’t jump right in; i put the paper down and sat there, deep in thought—thinkin’ about how dope it was that everything went down like this, and how close i came to bein’ lost and doomed. i kept reminiscin’ about our river trip; i kept picturin’ jim all the time – in the day, at night, sometimes under moonlight, sometimes amid crazy storms, and we were just floatin’, chattin’, singin’, and laughin’. somehow, i couldn’t find any reason to harden my heart against him—instead, i only felt the warmest vibes. i remembered him standin’ on his own watch instead of callin’ me over so i could catch more z’s; i remembered how stoked he was when i emerged from the fog; and when i met him again in the swamp near that old beef zone; and every single time he’d call me honey, pat me, and do everything to show he cared—always bein’ so solid. then i remembered the time i saved him by fibbin’ that we had smallpox onboard, and he was so grateful he said i was the best friend old jim ever had, the only one he got now; then, outta nowhere, i glanced at that paper.



it was mad savage thoughts and even mad savage words, but they got dropped anyway. and i let 'em ride, no edits—i was like, "cool, let that sit," and never even peeped reforming again. i totally yeeted that whole idea from my brain and was like, "time to flex my wicked side once more," cuz that’s how i was bred, and the other path just wasn’t my vibe. and real talk, for a starter i was all about jacking jim out of slavery again; and if i could cook up something even more extra, i’d go for it too—since i was in it for life, i might as well go all in, no cap.

then i got my mind in gear, brainstorming like a total meme lord on how to pull it off, flipping through ideas like a netflix binge; and finally, i landed on a plan that totally suited my drip. so i scoped out a woody island vibe down the river, and as soon as it got hella dark, i snuck out on my raft, slid for it, stashed it there, and then bounced. i crashed hard all night, woke up pre-dawn, grabbed some brekkie, threw on my store threads, bundled up some extra gear, hopped in my canoe, and paddled towards shore. i landed right under what i pegged as phelps’s spot, hid my bundle in the woods, then rigged the canoe by flooding it and loading it up with rocks so it’d be sunk in a secret spot—about a quarter-mile below a chill little steam sawmill on the bank.

so, i hit the road, and as i cruised past the mill, i peeped a sign that read “phelps’s sawmill,” and when i rolled up to the farm-houses a couple hundred yards further, i had my eyes on full alert but didn’t spot anyone—even though the daylight was on point. but i was cool with it, cuz i wasn’t tryna see anyone just yet—I only had to get the lay of the land. according to my master plan, i was gonna slide up from the village, not from below. so i scoped it out quick and dipped straight for town. and yo, the very first dude i bumped into was the duke. he was flexing a billy for the “royal nonesuch”—a three-night performance—like that other time. the nerve of these clout chasers was wild! i was all up in his grill before he could even dip. he looked hella shook, and goes:

  “hel-lo! where’d you pop off from?”  

then, all hyped and eager, he adds, “where’s the raft?—it chillin’ in a solid spot?”

i was like, “ngl, that’s exactly what i was about to ask, your grace.”

then his vibe flipped and he goes, “what was your plan for asking me?”

“well,” i say, “when i peeped the king in that dump yesterday, i was like, ‘we ain’t getting him home for hours until he’s less lit,’ so i started loitering around town to kill time. then some dude slid up offering me ten cents to help him haul a skiff over the river for a sheep, so i jumped on that hustle; but when we were tryna drag the sheep to the boat, and the dude left me clutching half the rope while he pushed it along, the sheep was too beefy and broke free, and we chased it all over the hood until we finally caught up at dusk. then we carted it over, and i bounced for the raft. when i rolled in and saw the raft was straight-up ghost, i was like, “they got into deep drama and had to dip; and they jacked my nay nay—the only nay nay i got in the world—and now i’m stuck in this wild-ass place with no property, no clout, and zero means to hustle;” so i parked and bawled my eyes out. i ended up crashing in the woods all night. but yo, what became of the raft then?—and jim—poor jim!

“blamed if i know—that is, what’s become of the raft. that old fool scored a trade for forty bucks, and when we found him in that dump, the loafers swapped half-dollars with him and snagged every cent except what he spent on whisky; and when i hauled him home late last night and peeped the raft was a no-show, we were all like, ‘that little rascal jacked our raft, shook us up, and dipped down the river.’”

“i would never ghost my nay nay, would i?—the only nay nay i had in the world, and the only real asset.”

“we never even peeped that. facts are, i reckon we started vibing with him as if he were our nay nay; yep, we legit considered him that—no cap, we had mad drama for him. so when we found the raft gone and our pockets were totally dry, our only move was to give the royal nonesuch one more spin. and i’ve been pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. where’s that ten cents? hand it over.”

i had some decent cash, so i slid him ten cents, but begged, “spend it on some munchies and hook me up a bit,” cuz that was all i had, and i hadn’t grubbed since yesterday. he kept it on mute. next minute, he spins on me and goes:

“do you reckon that nay nay would snitch on us? we’d peel him if he did that!”

“how would he snitch? didn’t he bounce?”

“no! that old fool sold him, and never even split the cash with me, and now the money’s ghost.”

“sold him?” i say, starting to tear up; “bro, he was my nay nay, and that was my cash. where is he?—i want my nay nay back.”

“well, you can’t get your nay nay, that’s just how it is—so zip your yap. listen up—do you really think you’d dare snitch on us? blamed if i’d ever trust you. like, if you tried to snitch on us—”

he paused, and i’ve never seen the duke look that extra ugly before. i started whimpering, and said:

“i don’t wanna snitch on nobody; and i ain’t got time for that, no cap. i gotta bounce and find my nay nay.”

he looked seriously shook, with his bills fluttering on his arm, deep in thought, wrinkling his forehead like he was processing a cringe meme. finally, he goes:

“i’ll drop some deets. we gotta chill here for three days. if you promise not to snitch, and not let the nay nay snitch, i’ll spill exactly where to find him.”

so i promised, and he goes:

“a farmer by the name of silas ph—” then he trailed off. see, he started droppin’ truth, but then paused and overthought it, and i figured he was just switching his vibe. and he was. he didn’t trust me fully; he needed me out of the picture for the whole three days. so pretty soon he says:

“the dude who bought him is called abram foster—abram g. foster—and he lives like forty miles back in the sticks, on the road to lafayette.”

“all right,” i say, “i can trek that in three days. i’ll bounce this very afternoon.”

“no you won’t, you’re bouncin’ now; and don’t waste any time or start chattin’ up a storm. just keep your tongue zipped and roll out, alright? then you won’t catch any beef with us, got it?”

that was the order i was vibing with, and that’s what i played for. i needed to be free to work my hustle.

“so scram,” he says, “and you can tell mr. foster whatever you wanna drop. maybe you can spin it so he believes that jim is your nay nay—some idiots don’t even need receipts—leastways i heard that’s a thing down south. and when you tell him that the flyer and the reward are bogus, maybe he’ll buy it when you break down the master plan for bustin’ ‘em out. bounce now, and spill whatever, but keep your trap shut from here to there.”

so i dipped and bounced for the back country. i didn’t keep looking back, but lowkey i felt like he was stalking my vibe. still, i knew i could wear him out eventually. i rolled straight out into the wild for about a mile before i doubled back through the woods toward phelps’s. i figured i had to lock in my plan without messin’ around, cuz i needed to zip jim’s lip until these fools could ghost. i wasn’t tryna spark beef with their type. i’d peeped enough of them, and just wanted to be rid of that drama.

chapter xxxii.

when i rolled up there, it was all chill and sunday-mode, blazing hot and mad sunshiny; the folks were all out in the fields; and there was this low-key drone from bugs and flies buzzing in the air that made it feel hella lonely, like everyone had already dipped. and if a breeze rolled by, shaking the leaves, it gave off a serious melancholy vibe—as if ancient spirits were lowkey whisperin’ secrets, dead for centuries and always dissin’ you. overall, it was the kind of vibe that makes a body wish it could just yeet itself outta this endless nightmare.

phelps’s was one of those one-horse cotton plantations, all cut from the same cloth. there was a rail fence around a two-acre yard; a makeshift log stile, all sawed off and flipped into uneven steps—like mismatched barrels to help you hop the fence, and for the ladies to perch on when jumpin’ on a horse; some scraggly patches of grass in the yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat that lost all its fluff; a big double log house for the white homies—hewed logs with the gaps patched up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes got whitewashed every now and then; a round-log kitchen with a wide, open but roofed passage hooking it up to the house; a log smokehouse behind the kitchen; three tiny log nay nay-cabins lined up on the other side of the smokehouse; one lonely hut all by itself down against the back fence, and some shed-like outbuildings on the flip side; an ash-hopper and a massive kettle for cooking soap right by that little hut; a bench by the kitchen door with a bucket of water and a gourd; a hound catching z’s in the sun; more hounds snoozing around; about three shady trees chillin’ in a corner; some currant and gooseberry bushes near the fence; outside the fence, a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields started up, and after that, the woods.

i bounced around and clambered over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started edging toward the kitchen. after a bit, i caught the low-key hum of a spinning-wheel whining on and off like it was stuck in a sad remix; and in that moment, i legit wished i was ghost—no cap, that sound was the epitome of loneliness.

i just kept rollin’, no strict plan, just trusting that providence would slide the perfect words into my mouth when my time came; i always noticed providence drops the right vibes if you just let it do its thing.

when i was about halfway through, first one hound then another popped off and ran at me, so i froze, facing ‘em like a statue. and damn, the pack went off! in like a quarter minute, i found myself surrounded like a hub made of dog spokes—about fifteen of ‘em all packed tight around me, noses and necks craned up, barking and howling like they were at a rave; and more kept rolling in—you could see ‘em sailing over fences and rounding corners from every direction.

then a nay nay woman burst out of the kitchen, clutching a rolling-pin like it was her lifetime prop, yelling, “begone you tige! you spot! begone sah!” she clapped one after another, sending them howling, and then half of them boomeranged back, wagging their tails around me and lowkey making friends. no harm in a hound, really.

right after, a little nay nay girl and two tiny nay nay boys—rockin’ nothing but tow-linen shirts—clung tight to their mama’s gown, peeking out shyly at me like it was their usual routine. then, a white woman, probably around forty-five or fifty and rocking no hair with her spinning-stick in hand, came sprinting out from the house; trailing her were her little white kids, acting just like those little nay nays. she was grinning so wide it was unreal—and she goes:

  “it’s you, at last!—ain’t it?”

i blurted out a “yes’m” before my brain could even catch up.

she grabbed me and squeezed me tight, then clutched both my hands and shook me like she was on a dance challenge, tears rolling down her face, and she just couldn’t stop—a continuous hug-shake fest—while saying, “you don’t look as much like your mom as i thought you would; but law sakes, i don’t even care, i’m so stoked to see you! damn, i could just eat you up! kids, it’s your cousin tom!—tell him howdy.”

but the kids ducked their heads, stuck their fingers to their lips, and hid behind her. so she kept on:

  “lize, hustle up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you snag your breakfast on the boat?”

i was like, “i already grubbed on the boat.” then she bounced for the house, leading me by the hand with the kids tagging along. when we rolled in, she plopped me down in a split-bottomed chair, sat herself on a low stool right in front of me, holding both my hands, and goes:

  “now i can peep you proper; and, no lie, i’ve been craving this moment for ages, and it’s finally here! we’ve been waiting on you for days. what held you up?—was the boat stuck?”

“yes’m—she—”

“don’t say yes’m—say aunt sally. where’d she get stuck?”

i didn’t really know what to say, cuz i wasn’t sure if the boat was coming up the river or down. but i ride on my gut a lot; and my gut said she’d be coming up—from the down vibes toward orleans. that didn’t help much, though, cuz i wasn’t clued in on the bar names down that route. i figured i had to either make up a bar or forget the real name of the one we got stuck on—or—then a brainwave hit, and i dropped it:

  “it wasn’t the grounding—that only slowed us down a bit. we straight-up blew a cylinder-head.”

“good gracious! anybody get hurt?”

“no’m. killed a nay nay.”

“well, it’s lucky; cuz sometimes people do get wrecked. two years ago last christmas, your uncle silas was cruisin’ up from newrleans on the old lally rook, and she blew a cylinder-head and totally wrecked a dude. and i think he died after that. he was a baptist, ya know. your uncle silas was tight with a fam in baton rouge that knew his peeps real well. yup, i remember—he did die. total mortification hit, and they even had to amputate him. but that didn’t save him. yep, it was all about that mortification—no cap. he turned blue all over and died, still hoping for some epic resurrection vibes. word is, he was a wild sight. your uncle’s been hitting town every day to scoop you up. and he bounced again, not more than an hour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. you must’ve peeped him on the road, right?—old school dude, with a—”

“no, i didn’t peep anyone, aunt sally. the boat landed right at daylight, and i ditched my baggage on the wharf-boat and cruised around town and out in the country to kill time so i wouldn’t roll in too early; so i came through the back way.”

“who did you offload the baggage with?”

“nobody.”

“child, it’s gonna get jacked!”

“nah, i reckon it won’t, cuz i hid it tight,” i say.

“how’d you snag breakfast so early on the boat?”

it was like walkin’ on thin ice, but i reply:

“the captain peeped me chillin’ and was like, ‘you better munch before you hit land,’ so he scooped me into the texas with the officers’ lunch and hooked me up with all i wanted.”

i was getting mad uneasy and couldn’t even focus. my brain was all on the kids; i wanted to scoop ‘em aside, vibe with them, and figure out who i was. but i couldn’t get any scoop as mrs. phelps kept on goin’. pretty soon, she sent cold chills down my spine as she goes:

  “but listen up, we’re rollin’ this way and you haven’t dropped a word about sis or any of them. now i’m gonna take a breather, and you spill yours; just break it all down—tell me everything about every single one—how they’re doin’, what they’re up to, and what they told you to pass on; every last deet you got.”

well, i was totally stumped—like, seriously stuck. providence had been chillin’ with me up until then, but now i was hella cornered. i figured pushin’ on was useless—I had to throw up my hands. so i thought, “here’s another moment to risk dropping the truth.” i cracked my mouth open to spill, but she grabbed me and hustled me behind the bed, and goes:

  “here he comes! tuck your head down—yeah, that’s it; you gotta stay low-key. don’t let on you’re here. i’m gonna play a prank on him. kids, zip it—don’t say a word.”

i knew i was in a tight fix now. but no point in stressing; i just had to stay still and be ready to bounce when the lightning struck.

i caught just a quick glimpse of the old gentleman when he popped in; then the bed shadowed him. mrs. phelps jumped up for him and goes:

  “has he come?”

“no,” says her husband.

  “goodness gracious! what the heck happened to him?”

“i can’t even picture it,” the old gentleman says, “and not gonna lie, it’s got me hella uneasy.”

“uneasy!” she goes, “i’m about to lose it! he must roll in; and you totally missed him along the road. i know it—something’s screaming that he’s here.”

“why, sally, i couldn’t have missed him on the road—you know that.”

“but oh, dear, dear, what will sis say! he must be here! you gotta have missed him. he—”

“oh, don’t stress me out even more—I’m already wrecked. i don’t know what to make of it. i’m at my wit’s end, and i’m straight-up scared. but there’s zero chance he’s here; he couldn’t roll in and i miss him. sally, it’s absolutely tragic—just tragic—something went down with the boat, for sure!”

“why, silas! peep over there!—up the road!—ain’t that someone coming?”

he shot up to the window at the head of the bed, which gave mrs. phelps her opening. she quickly stooped at the foot of the bed and tugged me out, and boom, i was out; and when he turned back from the window, there she was, beaming and smiling like a house on fire, and there i was, standing all meek and sweaty beside her. the old gentleman just stared, and goes:

  “whoa, who’s that?”

  “who do you reckon it is?”

  “i ain’t got no clue. who is it?”

  “it’s tom sawyer!”

by jings, i nearly dropped through the floor! but there wasn’t time for any smack talk; the old man grabbed my hand and shook it non-stop, while the woman danced around, laughing and crying like crazy; and then they both started firing off questions about sid, and mary, and the rest of the fam.

but if they were all hyped, it didn’t even compare to how i was feelin’—it was like a total rebirth, i was so stoked to remember who i was. they grilled me for nearly two hours; and by the time my chin was so done it could barely function, i’d spilled more about my family—the sawyer family—than any six sawyer fams ever did. i even broke down how we blew a cylinder-head at the mouth of the white river, and it took us three whole days to fix it. which was chill and worked like a dream; 'cause they all thought only three days could fix it. if i’d called it a bolthead, it would’ve done just as rad.

now i was riding high on one side but feeling hella off on the other. being tom sawyer was, like, a total breeze and comfy, until suddenly i heard a steamboat coughing its way down the river. then i was like, “yo, what if tom sawyer rolls in on that boat? and what if he steps in any minute and drops my name before i can even wink him to zip it? that just won’t fly—it wouldn’t do at all. i gotta hit the road and intercept him. so i told the crew that i’d bounce to town and scoop my baggage. the old gentleman wanted to roll with me, but i was like, ‘nah, i got this—i can ride the horse solo, and i’d rather not have him hassle me.’”

chapter xxxiii.

so i started for town in the wagon, and halfway through, i peeped another wagon rolling up—and sure enough, it was tom sawyer—so i pulled over and waited for him to bounce up beside me. i shouted, “hold up!” and he stopped right alongside, his mouth gaping wide like a trunk, frozen in that epic moment; he gulped two or three times like someone with a parched throat, and then he goes:

  “i ain’t ever done you any harm. you know that. so, whatchu wanna come back and snub me for?”

i replied, “i ain’t bounced—I haven’t been gone.”

when he caught my voice, it perked him up a bit, but he still wasn’t entirely satisfied, and he goes:

don’t you be playing no games on me, cuz i wouldn’t ever do that to you. real talk, honest injun, you ain’t some ghost or what?  
real talk, i ain’t.  

well—i mean, that should settle the tea, but i’m still hella shook. yo, have you ever gotten murdered or somethin’?  
nah fam, i’ve never been murdered—i totally played it off. slide on in and test me if you ain’t buying what i’m saying.  

so boom, he did his thing and was mad hyped to see me again—like, he lost his mind in a good way. he was tryna scoop up all the deets right away ‘cause it was a grand adventure, mysterious as heck, hittin’ him right in the feels. but i was like, “chill on it till later,” told his driver to park it, and we bounced a bit while i spilled the tea on my mess. then i asked, “yo, what’s the move?” and he was like, “let him ride his vibe for a minute, don’t bug him.” after flexin’ his brain for a sec, he dropped:  

“it’s all right; i got the plan. grab my trunk, toss it in your wagon like it’s all yours; then cruise back slow-mo so you hit the crib at just the right time; meanwhile, i’ll dip toward town, restart my grind, and slide in like fifteen to thirty minutes after you—no need to flex who i am right off.”  

i was like, “aight, but hold up—there’s one more thing that only i know. peep this: there’s a nay nay here i’m about to liberate from slavery, and his name is jim—old miss watson’s jim.”  

“what! like, jim is—”  
he paused and started studying me. i hit him with, “i know what you’re gonna say—you’re gonna call that dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? i’m low as it gets; i’m dead set on stealing him, so keep it on the down-low, aight?”  

his eyes lit up, and he goes, “bet, i’ll help you snatch him!”  

yo, i legit dropped everything like i’d been shot—this was the most jaw-dropping speech i’d ever heard, and ngl, tom sawyer totally took a nosedive in my book. i mean, tom sawyer, a nay nay stealer!  

“oh, fr fr!” i say, “you’re straight clownin’, right?”  
“i ain’t playin’,” he shoots back.  
“well, then,” i say, “joking or not, if you catch any chatter about a runaway nay nay, remember—you know nothing about him, and neither do i.”  

so we loaded up the trunk into my ride, then he bounced off in his whip while i cruised mine. of course, i spaced on the whole slow-roll vibe ‘cause i was hyped and deep in thought; so i rolled home way too quick for a trip. our old gent was posted at the door, dropping his lines:  

“why, this is wonderful! who’d have even vibed that that old mare could flex like that? i wish we’d synced her up right. and she ain’t even broke a sweat—not one hair. it’s pure magic. i wouldn’t drop a hundred bucks on that horse now—no cap; and yet i sold her for fifteen back in the day, thinking that was all she was worth.”  

that was his whole vibe. he was the chillest, purest old soul i’d ever seen. and ngl, it didn’t shock me ‘cause he wasn’t just a farmer—dude was also a preacher, rockin’ a one-horse log church way out back on the plantation, built with his own hustle for both church and school, and he never charged a dime for his preaching. lots of farmer-preachers down south were on that same grind.  

in about half an hour, tom’s wagon pulled up by the front stile, and aunt sally peeped it through the window from about fifty yards out, and goes:  

“whoa, peep someone comin’! i wonder who it is? i’m thinkin’ it’s a stranger. jimmy—” (one of the kiddos) “sprint and holler at lize to set another plate for dinner.”  

everyone jetted for the front door ‘cause, obviously, strangers don’t roll through every year—they set off that once-a-year hype. tom was already over the stile, strutting into the house; his wagon spun off toward the village, and we all huddled at the door. tom rocked his fly threads with his audience—always peak for tom sawyer. he wasn’t some timid kid creeping up like a basic sheep; nah, he came in bold and boss-like, like a ram owning the yard. when he landed in front of us, he lifted his hat all suave and delicate—as if it were a collector’s lid with butterflies chillin’ inside that he didn’t wanna disturb—and said:  

“mr. archibald nichols, i presume?”  

“nah, kid,” the old gent replies, “sorry to break it to you but your driver played you; nichols’s spot is like three miles further. come on in, come on in.”  

tom glanced back and deadpanned, “too late—he dipped out of sight.”  

“yep, he’s gone, my son, and you gotta come in and chow with us; then we’ll hitch up and roll you over to nichols’s.”  

“oh, i ain’t tryna hassle y’all; i’m cool—i’ll walk, no sweat on the distance.”  

“nah fam, we ain’t about lettin’ you walk—that ain’t southern hospitality. come on in.”  

“for real,” says aunt sally, “it ain’t no trouble at all. you gotta stay. it’s a long, dusty three miles, and we can’t let you trek. plus, i already hollered for another plate when i saw you comin’, so don’t disappoint us. slide right in and chill.”  

so tom was all grateful and handsome, and let himself be swayed, strollin’ in; and once inside, he goes, “i’m a stranger from hicksville, ohio, call me william thompson,” and he even dropped another bow.  

then he kept on spinnin’ wild tales about hicksville and all the fictional peeps he could dream up, while i got a bit nervous, wonderin’ how this was gonna pull me outta my scrape; and eventually, mid-story, he leaned over and planted a kiss right on aunt sally’s mouth before chillin’ back in his chair like it was all normal. aunt sally jumped up, wiped it off with the back of her hand, and fired off,  

“you cheeky puppy!”  

tom looked low-key hurt and goes, “i’m shook at you, ma’am.”  

aunt sally snapped, “yo, what do you think i am? i’ve got mad thoughts on that—like, what even is it meanin’ to kiss me?”  

tom, all humble, said, “i wasn’t tryna be sus, ma’am; i meant no harm. i just thought you’d be down with it.”  

“oh, you total dumbass!” she retorted, snatching up the spinning stick, barely holding back from smackin’ him. “what made you think i’d be down for that?”  

tom stammered, “i dunno—i mean, they straight-up told me you would.”  

she snapped, “they told you i’d be down? whoever fed you that is totally twisted. i’ve never caught wind of any of that. who are these clowns?”  

“man, everybody—they all hyped it up, ma’am.”  

she nearly lost it, eyes flashing and fingers twitchin’ like she was fixin’ to scratch him, then said, “who’s ‘everybody’? spit out their names, or i’mma call you a complete idiot.”  

tom stood up, lookin’ all distressed, fumbling his hat, and goes, “i’m sorry, i wasn’t expecting this. they told me to do it—every single one said, ‘kiss her,’ and swore she’d be into it. but i’m sorry, ma’am, i won’t do it again—honest.”  

aunt sally fired back, “you ain’t gonna, right? well, i’m countin’ on it!”  

tom replied, “for real, i’m as honest as they come; i won’t ever do it again—unless you literally ask me.”  

“till i ask you? man, i’ve never seen anything like it in my whole life! i bet you’ll be the oldest, dumbest dinosaur before i ever even think of askin’ you—or any like you.”  

tom then went, “yo, i legit am shook. i can’t figure it out—everyone said you’d be down, so i assumed you would. but—” he paused, scanning the room like he was huntin’ for a friendly nod, then shot a look at the old gent and asked, “didn’t you reckon she’d be down for my kiss, sir?”  

the old gent replied, “nah, i mean, i don’t think so.”  

then he glanced over at me and goes, “tom, did you not think aunt sally would be like, arms wide open, hollerin’ ‘sid sawyer—’”  

“my goodness!” aunt sally burst in, jumpin’ at him, “you impudent little rascal, pullin’ a fast one on someone so—” she started to hug him, but he dodged and said, “no, not until you straight up ask me first.”  

she didn’t waste a minute—she asked him, then hugged and kissed him over and over, before handing him off to the old gent, who took over the convo. once things calmed down, she said,  

“oh wow, i ain’t seen a surprise that wild. we weren’t even expecting you at all, just tom—sis only hollered about him comin’.”  

“it’s ‘cause it was only meant for tom to roll through,” he explained, “but i begged and begged, and at the last sec, she let me tag along too; so while we were cruisin’ down the river, me and tom figured it’d be epic if tom popped in first and then i dropped by later, playin’ the stranger. but, aunt sally, gotta say—that was a major misfire. this joint ain’t doin’ it for random visitors.”  

aunt sally snapped back, “nah—not you impudent whelps, sid. you oughta get your mouth punched; i haven’t been this put off since who-knows-when. but honestly, i ain’t even trippin’—i’d take a thousand more of your jokes just to have you here. seriously, that performance? i was mad shook with astonishment when you smacked me.”  

we grubbed in that huge open passage between the house and the kitchen; the table was stacked enough to feed like seven squads—and everything was piping hot, not that janky, tough meat that’s been chillin’ in some dank cellar all night and tastes like old cold leftovers the next morning. uncle silas dropped a long bless over it, and it was well worth it; plus, it didn’t lose its heat like those lame interruptions i see all the time.  

there was mad chatter all afternoon, and tom and i were on high alert the whole time; but no cap, they never dropped any tea about a runaway nay nay, and we were hella scared to even mention it.  

but come dinner time, at night, one of the little kids piped up, “pa, can tom, sid, and me dip to the show?”  

the old man replied, “nah, i reckon there ain’t gonna be one; and even if there was, y’all couldn’t go, ‘cause that runaway nay nay spilled all the tea about that scandalous show to burton and me, and burton said he’d tell everyone; so i figure they already booted those owdacious slackers out of town.”  

so that was that! i couldn’t help it—tom and i were crashin’ in the same room, same bed; so, mad tired, we wished each other goodnight and crashed right after dinner, then bounced out the window, slid down the lightning-rod, and raced for town—‘cause i knew no one was gonna drop a hint to the king and the duke, and if i didn’t hustle and clue ‘em in, they’d be in deep trouble for sure.  

on the road, tom dropped all the deets about how folks reckoned i got murdered, how pap straight-up vanished and never came back, and the wild stir when jim dipped; i dished out everything ‘bout our royal nonesuch gang and the epic raft voyage i could recall; and as we cruised into town, rollin’ through the center—like, it was around half-past eight—a wild mob with torches came blazing in, yelling, banging tin pans, and honkin’ horns; so we dipped aside to let ‘em roll by. as they passed, i peeped that the king and the duke were posted on a rail—i knew it was them, even though they were covered in tar and feathers and looked nothing human, just like a couple of monstrous, overgrown soldier-plumes. man, it made me straight-up sick; i felt mad sorry for those pitiful clowns, like i couldn’t ever be hard on ‘em again. it was a straight-up tragedy—humans can be hella cruel to each other.  

we were too late—couldn’t do any good. we hit up some stragglers, and they said everyone at the show played it all innocent, kept low-key until the poor old king was in the middle of his show on stage; then someone gave a signal, and the joint flipped, chasing them down.  

so we bounced back home, and i wasn’t as cocky as before—I felt kinda ornery, humble, and even a bit to blame (even though i did nothing). but that’s just how it goes; whether you do right or wrong, your conscience don’t check itself, and it just does its thing anyhow. if i had a yeller dog with as much sense as a person’s conscience, i’d pison that mutt. it takes up more room than everything else inside a person but ain’t worth squat. tom sawyer was on that same vibe.  

chapter xxxiv.  

we clammed up and started thinking. after a minute, tom hits, “yo, huck, how dumb are we for not peepin’ it earlier! bet i got the deets on where jim’s hidin’.”  

huck fired, “nah! where tho?”  

tom replied, “in that shack down by the ash-hopper. peep this: when we were chowin’ down, you saw a nay nay dude roll in with some vittles, right?”  

“yeah.”  

“what did you reckon that grub was for?”  

“for a dog, obviously.”  

“same, i thought so—but turns out it wasn’t for a dog.”  

“why?”  

“’cause part of it was watermelon.”  

“so it was—i peeped that. honestly, it beats all thinkin’ about a dog not munchin’ on watermelon. it’s wild how you can be seein’ and not seein’ at the same time.”  

“yo, check it—this nay nay unlocked the padlock when he bounced in, then re-locked it on his way out. he even grabbed uncle a key around the time we got off the table—same key, bet. watermelon vibes show a man, and a lock screams ‘prisoner’; and there’s no way there’s two prisoners on such a tiny plantation where everyone’s chill and on their best behavior. jim’s the prisoner. aight—i’m hyped we cracked it detective-style; i wouldn’t trade that method for any other. now, flex your brain and cook up a plan to liberate jim, and i’ll do the same; and we’ll roll with whichever plan vibes best.”  

damn, what mad brainpower for just a kid to rock! if i had tom sawyer’s noggin, i wouldn’t swap it for a duke title, a steamboat gig, a circus clown job, or anything wild i can think of. i started brainstorming a plan, but just to keep busy ‘cause i knew the perfect plan would drop eventually.  

real quick, tom bounced and went, “ready?”  

“yeah,” i replied.  

“cool, lay it out.”  

huck kicked in, “so here’s the plan: we can low-key scope out if jim’s in there. then, tomorrow night, i’ll pull up my canoe and grab my raft from the island. when the first dark night hits, we swipe the key from the old man’s britches after he crashes, and then bounce down the river on the raft with jim—hiding by day and sprinting by night, just like old times. bet that plan would totally work, right?”  

tom dropped, “work? for sure it’d work hard, like rats fighting over cheese, but it’s way too basic; not enough sauce. what’s the point of a plan that’s as bland as goose-milk? it wouldn’t cause any buzz—kinda like breakin’ into a soap factory would be.”  

i clammed up ‘cause i wasn’t tryna hear extra, but i knew deep down that whenever tom dropped his plan, there’d be zero fuss over objections.  

and, no cap, he laid it out—and i peeped that it had mad style, worth like fifteen of my cents, and would free jim just as legit, though maybe get us all toasted. i was down, and said we’d roll with it. i don’t even gotta spill the deets here ‘cause i knew it wouldn’t stick as it was; i knew he’d be switchin’ it up every which way, droppin’ new twists whenever he could. and that’s exactly what went down.  

but one thing was crystal clear: tom sawyer was 100% serious about helping snatch that nay nay outta slavery. and that was just too extra for me. here was a kid supposed to be all respectable and well-brought-up—with a solid rep, a good family, bright as hell and not bonehead-level dumb, kind instead of mean—and yet he was willingly stooping so low, makin’ a total shame of himself and his fam in front of everyone. i just couldn’t vibe with it. it was straight-up outrageous, and i figured i needed to call him out, be a real friend, and tell him to scrap this hustle and save himself. i started to speak up, but he cut me off, saying,  

“don’t you reckon i know what i’m about? don’t i seriously know what i’m about?”  

“yeah,” i said.  

“didn’t i say i was gonna help snatch the nay nay?”  

“yeah.”  

“well, then.”  

that was it—words were done. there was no point saying more; when tom said he’d do somethin’, he always came through. still, i couldn’t wrap my head around how far he was willing to go with this, so i let it slide and never pressed further. if that’s just how he rolled, i couldn’t do much about it.  

when we got back home, the place was dark and dead quiet; so we dipped down to the hut by the ash-hopper to scope it out. we rolled through the yard to peep how the hounds would react—they knew us well and were as quiet as any country dogs get when somethin’ stumbles by at night.  

once we reached the cabin, we peeped the front and both sides; on the north side—the one i wasn’t too familiar with—we discovered a square window hole set pretty high, with one stout board nailed across it. i said,  

“this is our ticket. this hole’s legit big enough for jim to squeeze through if we just pop off that board.”  

tom chimed in, “it’s as straightforward as tic-tac-toe, three in a row, and as chill as skipping class. i mean, i hope we can flex a plan with a bit more flavor than that, huck finn.”  

huck fired back, “so how ‘bout we saw him out, like i did before i got, well, ‘murdered’ that time?”  

“now that’s more like it,” tom said. “it’s hella mysterious, tricky, and dope; but i bet we can cook up something twice as epic. no rush—let’s keep scoping around.”  

between the hut and the fence at the back, there was a lean-to that jutted off the hut at the eaves, built out of plank. it was as long as the hut but narrow—only about six feet wide. its door was on the south end and was padlocked. tom bounced over to the soap-kettle, rummaged around, and grabbed that iron tool they use to pop lids; he used it to pry out one of the staples. the chain dropped, and we popped open the door, slipped inside, shut it, struck a match, and peeped that the shed was just slapped up against the cabin with no real connection—no floor inside, just a bunch of old rusty, busted hoes, spades, picks, and a beaten-down plow. the match fizzled out, so we put the staple back in, locking the door up tight. tom was stoked and goes,  

“now we’re solid. we’ll dig him out—should take about a week, fr!”  

then we bounced back for the house, and i slipped in through the back door—you just gotta tug a buckskin latch-string since they don’t lock ‘em—but that wasn’t epic enough for tom sawyer; nah, he had to go climb the lightning-rod. after half climbing it about three times, nearly getting singed and falling each time—and the last time almost busting his noggin—he was like, “aight, i’m done,” but after catchin’ his breath, he decided to give it one more go, and this time, he actually made the climb.

so, like, at daybreak we were hella up and rolled out right at sunrise, then dipped to the nay nay cabins to pet the dogs and chill with the nay nay who fed jim—if jim was even the one gettin fed, no cap. the whole nay nay crew was just finishing up their brekkie and bouncin’ for the fields; meanwhile, jim’s nay nay was lowkey stacking a tin pan with bread, meat, and all that grub, and while the rest were bouncin’, the key slid out from the crib.

this nay nay had a chill, goofy mug, and his wool was all tied up in lil bundles with thread—lowkey to keep off any witch vibes. he was complainin’ that these damn witches had been buggin’ him hardcore on the reg, makin’ him see some seriously trippy stuff and hear all kinds of odd noises, and he swore he’d never been hit with witchcraft like that in his whole life. he got so hyped talkin’ about his drama that he straight-up forgot what he was supposeda do. then tom pops off:

"what’s the vittles for? going to feed the dogs?"

the nay nay slowly breaks into a grin, spreadin’ across his face like when you lob a brick into a mud puddle, and he goes:

"yeah, mars sid, a dog. a cur’us dog, too. you wanna go check him out?"

tom just goes, "yes."

i huddled tom up and whispered, "yo, you rollin’ out here at daybreak? that weren't the plan, fam."

tom be like, "nah, it wasn't; but it's the plan now."

so, damn, we rolled along even though i wasn’t feelin’ it much. when we rolled in, it was so dark i could barely see a thing; but jim was posted there, no cap, and hollered, "yo, huck! en good lan’! ain’t that mista tom?"

i was like, i totally knew this was comin’. i had zero clue what to do, and even if i did, i couldn’ta pulled it off, cuz then that nay nay busted in and goes, "why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"

we could see clear as day now. tom peered at the nay nay, all chill and kinda puzzled, and goes, "yo, does anyone know us?" the nay nay snaps back, "why, dis-yer runaway nay nay." tom goes, "i don’t reckon he does; but what made that pop into your head?" the nay nay answers, "what made it pop? didn’t he just sing out like he knew you?" then tom, all puzzled, goes, "bruh, that’s hella curious. who dropped the tune? when did he drop it? what did he even sing?" he turns to me, all cool, and asks, "did you catch anyone singin’?"

of course, there wasn’t much to add, so i said, "no; i ain’t heard nobody say nothin’." then tom turned to jim, eyeballin’ him like a stranger, and asked, "did you drop any lines?" jim replied, "no, sah, i haven’t said nothin’, sah." "not a word?" "no, sah, not one word." "did you ever peep us before?" "no, sah; not as i knows on."

then tom turned to the nay nay—who looked all wild and stressed—and said, all serious, "yo, what’s wrong with you anyway? what made you think somebody dropped a tune?" the nay nay goes, "oh, it’s the damn witches, sah; and i wish i was dead, i do. they’re always on my case, sah, messin’ with my head so bad they nearly kill me. please, don’t spill the tea about it, sah, cuz old mars silas will come down on me hard—’kase he says there ain’t no witches. i just wish, like, the goodness of all things that he was here now—imagine what he’d say! i bet he wouldn’t be able to figure out a way around this mess this time. but it’s always like that; trash people stay trash—they won’t even try to work stuff out on their own, and when you do and drop the deets, they don’t believe you."

tom slides him a dime and goes, "we won’t snitch on you," then tells him to cop some more thread to tie up his wool. he turns to jim and adds, "i wonder if uncle silas is gonna hang this nay nay. if i copped a nay nay that was ungrateful enough to dip, i wouldn’t hand him over—I’d hang him, no cap." while the nay nay stepped to the door to peep the dime and nibble on it to check if it was legit, he leaned in to jim and whispered, "yo, never let them know who we are. and if you hear any late-night diggin’, know it’s us—we’re fixin’ to set you free." jim only had time to grab our hands and squeeze ‘em; then the nay nay bounced back, and we said we’d roll by again sometime if he wanted us to; and he agreed—especially if it got dark, cuz the witches hit him hardest in the dark, and it’s chill when you got peeps around.

chapter xxxv.

we still had like an hour till breakfast, so we bounced into the woods; cuz tom was like, "we gotta have just enough light to scope out our dig, and a full-blown lantern is way too extra and might get us into hot water." what we needed was a load of those dodgy little chunks called fox-fire that give off a soft glow in the dark. so we scooped up an armful, stashed it in the weeds, and chilled for a sec, and then tom goes, kinda annoyed:

"blame it, this whole setup is mad extra and awkward—making our escape plan super sus and way too hard to pull together. there’s literally no watchman to get drugged—seriously, there should be one! not even a dog to knock out with a sleeping potion. plus, jim’s chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain to his bed—yo, all you gotta do is lift up that bedstead and slide the chain off. and uncle silas? dude trusts everyone, sends the key off to that punkin-headed nay nay, and don’t even bother posting anyone to watch him. jim coulda bounced out of that window ages ago, but then traveling with a ten-foot chain on your leg is a major vibe kill. damn, huck, it’s the stupidest setup i ever seen. you gotta come up with your own obstacles sometimes. well, we gotta work with what we got. anywho, there’s mad honor in bustin’ someone out through a bunch of difficulties and dangers—when none of those challenges are even handed to you, and you have to invent ’em yourself. now, check this: when it comes down to the facts, a lantern is just too risky. like, we could even roll with a torchlight procession if we felt like it. oh, and while i’m at it, we gotta scout for something to rig up a saw at the first chance we get."

"what do we need a saw for?" 

"what do we need it for? ain’t we supposed to cut jim’s bed leg off to free his chain?"

"yo, but you just said anyone could lift the bed and slide the chain off."

"that’s so you, huck finn. you always come up with these kiddie-level ideas. seriously, have you not peeped any books—baron trenck, casanova, benvenuto chelleeny, henri iv., or any of those epic heroes? who even heard of bustin’ a prisoner out in such a basic way? nah, the real legends go off by sawing the bed leg in half, leavin’ it like that, gulping down all the sawdust so no one can peep what went down, and then slapping some dirt and grease around the cut so even the sharpest seneskal can’t tell it was ever sawed—thinking the bed leg’s solid. then, on the night you’re ready, you give that leg a savage kick, and boom—the bed drops; you slip off your chain, and there you are. all that’s left is to hitch a rope ladder to the battlements, slide down like it’s nothing, maybe even break your leg in the moat—'cause, no cap, that rope ladder is like nineteen feet too short—and then your horses and trusty vassles scoop you up, chuck you on a saddle, and you’re out to your native langudoc, navarre, or wherever. it’s mad extra, huck. i’d kill for this cabin to have a moat. if we get time on the escape night, we’ll dig one."

i ask, "but what’s the point of a moat when we’re gonna snake him out from under the cabin?" 

but he totally zoned me out—forgot i even existed. he was just sittin’ there, chin in his hand, deep in thought. after a minute, he lets out a heavy sigh, shakes his head, then sighs again and goes, "nah, it wouldn’t work—there’s just no real need for it."

"for what?" i ask.

"for, like, sawing jim’s leg off," he says.

"lmfao, why would we even need to saw his leg off?" i snap.

"well, some of the top dogs have done it. they couldn’t unchain him any other way, so they just cut off their hand and shoved. and a leg would be even crazier. but we gotta drop that idea; there’s just no need here; plus, jim’s a nay nay and wouldn’t even get the reasons behind it or the fact that it’s a europe thing—so we’ll pass on that. but yo, one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we can rip up our sheets and stitch him one up real quick. and we can even slide it to him in a pie; that’s practically the move. and i’ve had worse pies."

i be like, "yo, tom sawyer, how you even spoutin’ that stuff? jim don’t even need a rope ladder."

"he does, man. real talk, you gotta admit—you don’t know squat about it. every prisoner needs a rope ladder; it’s like a must-have."

"so, what’s he gonna do with it anyway?"

"do with it? he can just stash it in his bed, right?" – that’s what everyone does, and he’s gotta, too. huck, you never wanna do anything regular; you’re always tryna kick off something fresh. suppose he ends up not usin’ it? it’d just be there in his bed as a backup after he bounces—don’t you reckon they’d want backups? of course they would. and you wouldn’t just leave ’em? that’d be a crazy mess, right? i swear, i’ve never heard of such a thing.

"well, if it’s in the rules and he’s gotta have it, alright, let him have it; cuz i’m not about breakin’ the regs. but there’s one thing, tom sawyer—if we end up tearin’ up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder, we’re gonna get roasted by aunt sally, no doubt."

tom goes, "oh, shucks, huck finn, if i were as clueless as you, i’d just zip it—that’s exactly what i’d do. who even heard of a state prisoner bustin’ out with a hickory-bark ladder? it’s straight-up ridiculous."

i reply, "alright, tom, do your thing; but lemme borrow one of those sheets off the clothesline."

he’s down with that, and then his brain sparks another idea, and he says, "borrow a shirt, too."

"yo, why do we need a shirt, tom?" i ask.

"it’s for jim to keep a journal on."

i fire back, "journal your granny—jim can’t write, dude."

"well, suppose he can’t write—he can at least scribble on the shirt, right? especially if we rig him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or some piece of an old iron barrel hoop."

"tom, we could just pluck a feather off a goose and whip him up a dope pen, and faster too."

"prisoners don’t have geese runnin’ around the donjon-keep to snag pens from, you muggins. they always make their pens outta the toughest, most stubborn piece of old brass candlestick they can get their mitts on; and it takes ’em weeks and weeks to file it down—rubbin’ it on the wall and all that. they wouldn’t even bother with a goose quill if they had one. it just ain’t the norm."

"so, what we gonna use for ink then?"

"plenty make it outta iron rust and tears; but that’s the basic stuff. the real legends use their own blood. jim can totally do that; and whenever he wants to drop a sneaky message ‘bout where he’s held up, he can scribble it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and chuck it out the window. the iron mask always did that, and it’s a damn good move."

"jim ain’t got no tin plates—they feed him in a pan."

"that’s cool; we can snag some for him."

"but nobody’s gonna be able to read his plates."

"that don’t even matter, huck finn. all he’s gotta do is scribble on the plate and toss it out. you don’t even need to read it—half the time, you can’t figure out a prisoner’s scribbles on a tin plate or anywhere else."

"so, what’s the point in wastin’ plates?"

"frankly, it ain’t even the prisoner’s plates."

"but they’re somebody’s plates, right?"

"well, maybe they are? what does the prisoner care whose they are—"

and he cut off 'cause we heard the breakfast horn blastin’. so we bounced back to the house.

later that mornin’, i swiped a sheet and a white shirt off the clothesline; i even grabbed an old sack to stash ’em in, then we slid down to scoop up the fox-fire and tossed that in too. i called it borrowing, ’cause that’s what pap always said; but tom was like, "nah, that ain’t borrowin’—that's straight-up stealin’." he said we were representin’ prisoners, and prisoners don’t give a damn how they snag what they need—nobody blames ‘em. it ain’t no crime for a prisoner to jack what he needs to bust out; it’s his right. so as long as we were reppin’ a prisoner, we had the perfect right to steal anything on this spot we didn’t even use that much, just to get outta prison. he said if we weren’t prisoners, it’d be a totally different vibe, and only a total jerk would steal when they weren’t locked down. so we decided we’d jack everything that came in clutch. still, tom made a huge fuss one day when i swiped a watermelon from the nay nay-patch and munched on it; he made me bounce over and drop a dime to the nay nays without even sayin’ what it was for. tom said his point was that we could steal whatever we needed. i was like, "dude, i needed that watermelon." but he clapped back, "nah, you don’t need it for the breakout;" and that’s where the beef was. he said if i wanted it to hide a knife and smuggle it to jim so he could off the seneskal, then it’d be cool. so i let it slide, ’cause i couldn’t vibe with all that gold-leaf extra every time i tried to cop a watermelon while representin’ a prisoner.

so, as i was sayin’, we waited that mornin’ till everyone was deep in their own biz and the yard was ghosted; then tom lugged the sack into the lean-to while i posted up on lookout. not long after, he bounced out, and we crashed on the woodpile to chop it up. he goes:

"everything’s all good now besides the tools; and that’s an easy fix."

"tools?" i ask.

"yeah."

"tools for what?" 

"to dig with, duh. we ain’t about to gnaw him out, are we?"

"ain't those busted old picks and junk in there enough to dig a nay nay out with?" i say.

tom shoots me a look, all pity-laced, and goes, "huck finn, you ever heard of a prisoner havin’ picks, shovels, and all the modern gear in his stash to bust out? now, i gotta ask—if you got any sense at all, what kinda flex would that give him as a hero? like, they might as well just hand him the key and be done. picks and shovels—they wouldn’t even be given to a king."

"well, then, if we ain’t down with picks and shovels, what we need then?" i ask.

"a couple of case-knives," tom replies.

"for diggin’ out the foundation under that cabin?" i ask.

"yeah," he nods.

"damn, that’s stupid, tom."

"it don’t matter how extra it sounds—it’s the real move, the standard play. there’s no other way i know of; i’ve read all the books on this. they always bust out usin’ a case-knife—not through loose dirt, mind you, but straight through solid rock. and it takes forever, like weeks on end. check out that prisoner in the bottom dungeon of castle deef down at marseilles harbor, who dug himself out that way; how long do you reckon he was at it?"

"i dunno," i shrug.

"well, guess then."

"maybe like a month and a half?" i venture.

"nah, bro, thirty-seven years—and he ended up in china. that’s the move. i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock."

"jim don’t even know anyone in china," i joke.

"what’s that got to do with it? neither did that guy, man. but you’re always off on a tangent—stick to the point!"

"alright—I don’t care where he ends up, as long as he busts out; and jim don’t either, i guess. but here’s the kicker—jim’s too old to be busted out with just a case-knife. he won’t last."

"nah, he’ll hold up fine. you don’t seriously think it’ll take thirty-seven years to hack through a dirt foundation, do you?"

"how long you reckon it’ll take, tom?" i ask.

"well, we can’t risk takin’ forever 'cause uncle silas might catch wind from down in new orleans. he’ll hear jim ain’t from there, and then his next move will be to shout jim out or somethin’. so we can’t stall on the dig too long. by all means, i reckon we should have a couple of years, but nah—it’s too risky. so, here’s what i’m thinkin’: we go all in, dig as fast as possible; then we can act like we spent thirty-seven years on it, and when the first alarm sounds, we swoop him up and bounce, pronto. that’s the move, no cap."

"yo, there’s sense in that," i say. "playin’ it up don’t cost a thing; actin’ like we were at it for a hundred and fifty years wouldn’t even be a problem, not after i got my hand in. so imma mosey along now and snag a couple case-knives."

"snag three," he shoots back, "we need one to hack into a saw."

"tom, if it ain’t too extra and sacrilegious to even say it, there’s an old rusty saw-blade over yonder, stuck under the weatherboarding behind the smoke-house."

he looked all weary and bummed, and goes, "ain’t no point tryna school you, huck. just run along and snag the knives—three of ‘em." so i did.

chapter xxxvi.

as soon as we peeped that everybody was knocked out that night, we slid down the lightning rod, locked ourselves in the lean-to, whipped out our stash of fox-fire, and got to hustlin’. we cleared out a path, like four or five feet wide along the center of the bottom log. tom said he was posted right behind jim’s bed, and we’d dig underneath it so sneaky that nobody in the cabin would ever peep a hole there—cuz jim’s counter-pin was hangin’ nearly to the ground, and you’d have to jack it up just to see any gap. so we hacked away with our case-knives until nearly midnight; and then we were straight-up dog-tired, our hands all blistered, yet it looked like we hadn’t done squat. finally, i go, "yo, this ain’t a thirty-seven year hustle; this is a thirty-eight year grind, tom sawyer."

he didn’t say a word—just sighed, and soon stopped diggin’. then, after a minute of dead silence that screamed he was deep in thought, he finally says, "it ain’t no use, huck—it ain’t gonna work. if we were legit prisoners, it’d be chill, 'cause then we’d have unlimited time and no rush; we’d only get a few minutes each day while they switched watches, so our hands wouldn’t get wrecked, and we could pace it out all year, do it proper. but we can’t play it slow—we gotta rush, cuz we ain’t got time to waste. if we put in another night like this, we’d have to stop for a whole week to let our hands heal—we wouldn’t even be able to touch a case-knife till then."

"so, what we gonna do, tom?" i ask.

"i’ll break it down for you. it ain’t exactly righteous, and i wouldn’t want it get out, but there’s only one play: we gotta dig him out with the picks and act like they’re just case-knives."



“now you’re talking, fam!” i be like; “yo, your brain stays hella level all the time, tom sawyer,” i spill the tea. “picks are the ultimate flex, moral or nah; and ngl, i don’t give two claps about that moral vibe. when i’m bout to snatch a nay nay, or jack a watermelon, or swipe a sunday-school book, i ain’t tripping about the deets—if it gets done, it’s done. what i need is my nay nay; or my watermelon; or that sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the dopest tool in the kit, that’s the tool i’m using to dig that nay nay, watermelon, or book out—i don’t care one bit what the fuzz thinks, no cap.”

“well,” he goes, “there’s legit reason to flex with picks and keep it on the low in a sitch like this; if it wasn’t, i wouldn’t vibe with it, nor would i stand around watching the rules get wrecked—’cause facts are facts: right is right and wrong is wrong, and you seriously shouldn’t go doing wrong when you know better. it might fly for you to dig jim out with a pick on the down-low, ‘cause you’re clueless; but not for me, i’m woke. hook me up with a case-knife.”

he had his own, but i slid him mine. he yeeted it down and goes:

“hook me up a case-knife.”

i was lowkey stunned, but then my brain clicked. i rummaged around the ancient tool stash, snagged a pickaxe, handed it over, and he got right to work without dropping another word.

he was, like, extra extra in that vibe—full of his own principles.

so then i grabbed a shovel, and we went full grind mode, picking and shoveling, twisting and turning, making the dirt fly. we smashed it for like half an hour, which was our max stamina; but yo, we ended up with one fat-ass hole. when i bounced upstairs, i peeped out the window and saw tom doing his best with the lightning rod, but the dude couldn’t even handle it—his hands were hurting way too much. finally, he goes:

“it ain’t workin’, bruh—it can’t be done. what u think i should do next? you got any better hacks?”

“yeah,” i reply, “but i feel it’s kinda sus. just bounce upstairs and play it off like it’s a legit lightning rod.”

so he went and did it.

the next day, tom jacked a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick from the crib to craft some pens for jim, and snagged six tallow candles; meanwhile, i hung around the nay nay cabins and waited for my chance, then swiped three tin plates. tom was like “that ain’t enough,” but i clapped back, “nobody’s gonna peep the plates that jim chucked ‘cause they’d fall right into the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window gap—then we can scoop ‘em up and he can reuse ‘em.” so tom was vibing. then he drops:

“now, the tea to spill is, how we slide these goodies over to jim.”

“just shove ‘em through the gap,” i say, “when we’re done.”

he gives off major eye-roll vibes and snaps something about nobody ever hearing of such a dumb idea, and then he goes back to brainstorming. after a minute, he says he’s decoded a couple of hacks, but there’s no need to lock one in yet—apparently we gotta get jim posted first.

that night, we slid down the lightning rod vibe just past ten, grabbed one candle, and scoped the window gap while listening to jim snorin’. we tossed the candle in, and guess what—it didn’t even glitch him. then we stormed in with our pick and shovel, and in like two and a half hours, boom—the mission was complete. we snuck under jim’s bed and into his crib, scrambled around, found the candle and lit it up, then hung around over jim for a hot minute, confirming he was still on his A-game and healthy. after that, we woke him up all smooth and gradual. dude was so hyped to see us he legit cried; he called us honey and every cute nickname in the book, and practically begged us to hunt down a cold chisel to slice the chain off his leg ASAP so he could dip without delay. but tom schooled him real quick on how sus that move was, sat him down, and broke down our master plan—how we could flip the script in a sec if any alarm went off; and told him not to sweat it, ‘cause we’d make sure he got out safe. so jim was chill and agreed to roll with it, and then we kicked back, reminisced a bit, and tom started throwing mad questions. when jim mentioned that uncle silas would roll in every day or two to pray with him, and aunt sally would pop by to make sure he was comfy and had enough grub—both being basically the kindest ever—tom goes:

“now, i got the fix. we’ll ship some goodies your way through them.”

i was like, “nah, don’t even try that; it’s one of the dumbest moves i’ve ever thought of,” but he totally ignored me and kept on truckin’. that’s just how he is when his plan’s locked in.

so he broke it down to jim: we’d have to quietly smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other chunky items via nat, the nay nay who fed him, and jim’s gotta be on high alert—don’t let nat catch him opening ‘em. we’d stash small stuff in uncle’s coat pockets for him to swipe; tie things to aunt’s apron strings or slip ‘em in her apron pocket if we got a chance; and he laid out what every item was for. he even told jim to keep a log on his shirt with his own blood and all that extra drama. jim wasn’t vibing with half of it, but he was like, “you white peeps know best,” so he was down to play along just as tom said.

jim had mad corn-cob pipes and tobacco, so we had a dope, chill session; then we crawled out through the gap and bounced back home to crash, our hands looking all chewed-up. tom was totally hyped. he claimed it was the dopest fun he ever had—super brainy too—and said if he could keep this turning, we’d keep the hustle going for life, leaving jim to our future kids to get him out later; ‘cause he was sure jim would warm up to it more and more. he even said this scam could stretch out for like eighty years and be the most epic saga on record. and, no cap, it’d make us all legends for being part of it.

in the morning, we hit the woodpile and hacked the brass candlestick into dope sizes, and tom stashed them along with the pewter spoon in his pocket. then we cruised over to the nay nay cabins, and while i jacked nat’s notice, tom jammed a piece of candlestick right into the center of a corn-pone chillin’ in jim’s pan. we rolled with nat to peep the reaction—and yo, it worked like magic; when jim chomped on it, the crunch straight-up mashed all his teeth. no cap, nothing coulda worked better. tom confirmed it himself. jim, ever cautious, acted like it was just a random rock that sometimes crashes in your bread, but after that he never bit into anything unless he jetted his fork in three or four times first.

and while we were chillin’ in that dim light, a couple of hounds started busting out from under jim’s bed—they just kept piling in until there were like eleven of ‘em, and there was barely any room to breathe. damn, we totally forgot to lock the lean-to door! the nay nay nat only hollered “witches” one time, then totally crashed onto the floor among the dogs, groaning like he was on his last level. tom quickly yanked the door open and flung out a slab of jim’s meat, and the pups went for it; in two seconds he bailed out, slammed the door shut, and i knew he’d fixed the other door too. then he went over to the nay nay, all soft, petting and coaxing him, asking if he’d been trippin’ and imagining things again. nat lifted up, blinked around, and goes:

“yo, mars sid, you’ll call me a clown, but if i didn’t believe i was seeing like a million pups, or devils, or something, id literally die right here in these vibes. i did, for real. yo, mars sid, i felt like—i felt like, damn; they were all over me. damn, i just wish i could get my hands on one of them witches just once—just once, that’s all i asked. but mostly, i just wished they’d leave me alone, ya feel me?”

tom then drops:

“well, here’s my two cents. what makes them roll up right at this wild runaway nay nay’s breakfast hour? it’s ‘cause they’re straight-up hungry; that’s the tea. you just whip up a witch pie—that’s the move for ya.”

“but bro, mars sid, how the heck am i gonna make a witch pie? i got no clue. i ain’t never peeped such a thing before.”

“well then, looks like i’m gonna have to DIY that thing.”

“will ya do it, babe?—will ya? i swear, i’ll scrub the floor under your foot!”

“aight, i’ll handle it, ‘cause you’re the real one and you’ve been solid showing us that runaway nay nay. but you gotta be hella careful. when we roll through, you gotta spin with your back turned; and whatever we drop in that pan, don’t even blink and let on you see it. and don’t even peek when jim unloads the pan—who knows what might pop off. and above all, don’t you even touch the witch stuff.”

“are you serious, mars sid? what are you even on about? i wouldn’t dare put my finger on that, not for, like, ten hundred trillion dollars, no cap.”

chapter xxxvii.

that was locked in. so then we dipped and hit up the rubbage-pile in the backyard, where they stash old kicks, ragged threads, bottle shards, busted tin junk, and all that random trash, and i scrounged around and found an ancient tin washpan. we patched up its holes as best we could to bake our pie in, hauled it down to the cellar, jacked it full of flour, and started on breakfast. i even found a couple shingle-nails that tom claimed would be dope for a prisoner to scratch his name and sorrows on dungeon walls, and i dropped one in aunt sally’s apron pocket that was chillin’ on a chair, and jammed the other right into the band of uncle silas’s hat on the bureau—‘cause we heard the kiddos saying their pa and ma were cruising to the runaway nay nay’s crib that morning. then we bounced to breakfast, and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas’s coat pocket. aunt sally wasn’t even there yet, so we had to kick it and wait a minute.

when she finally rolled in, she was all heated, red, and mad, barely able to wait for her blessing; then she started slinging coffee with one hand while smacking any kid in sight with her thimble using the other, and she goes:

“i’ve hunted high and i’ve hunted low, and this totally beats whatever your other shirt has become.”

my heart legit sank deep among my lungs, livers, and everything, and a hard piece of corn-crust slid down my throat afterwards, clashed with a cough, got blasted across the table, smacked one kid in the eye, and curled him up like a wiggly fishing worm—unleashing a scream the size of a war whoop. tom even turned a shade of blue around the gills, and it all became a major scene for like a quarter of a minute or so. i’d have flipped out for half price if anyone had bid on this drama. but lowkey, after that, we were all good again—it was the shock factor that froze us, ya know?

uncle silas goes:

“it’s super weird, i just can’t wrap my head around it. i know for real i took it off, because—”

“’cause you only got one on. listen up, man! i know you took it off, and i can tell better than your scrambled memory, ‘cause it was on the clothesline yesterday—I peeped it myself. but now it’s totally ghost, that’s the tea, and you gotta rock a red flannel one till i can carve out time to make a new one. and that’ll be the third i’ve dropped in two years. it just keeps you on edge having you live in shirts; and whatever you manage to do with ’em is way more than i can even decode. man, you’d think you’d learn to treat ’em with some respect at your age.”

“i know it, sally, and i swear i try my best. but it ain’t totally my fault, ‘cause, like, i don’t even see them or mess with them unless they’re on me; and i don’t think i’ve ever really lost one.”

“well, it ain’t your fault if you haven’t, silas; you’d have dropped it if you could, i guess. and it’s not just the shirt that’s missing, no cap. there’s a spoon gone—and that ain’t all. there were ten, and now there’s only nine. i reckon the calf snagged the shirt, but the calf never dipped for the spoon, that’s on lock.”

“yo, what else is missing, sally?”

“there’s six candles gone—that’s facts. the rats coulda totally jacked the candles, and i bet they did; i’m lowkey wondering why they don’t dip with the whole crib, since you’re always patching up their holes then leaving ‘em open; and if they weren’t total scrubbers, they’d practically sleep in your hair, silas—you’d never peep it; but you can’t pin the spoon on the rats, and that’s straight up.”

“alright, sally, i’m at fault, i own it; i’ve been slack, but i ain’t letting tomorrow slide by without blocking up those holes.”

“oh, no rush; next year is cool. matilda angelina araminta phelps!”

whack—comes the thimble, and the kid rips her claws out of the sugar bowl, no cap. just then, the nay nay woman struts onto the hall and goes:

“missus, there’s a sheet gone.”

“a sheet gone! like, for real!”

“i’ll patch those holes today,” says uncle silas, looking all sad-faced.

“oh, patch it up!—suppose the rats swiped the sheet? where’d it go, lize?”

“clah, honestly, i ain’t got a clue, miss sally. it was chillin’ on the clothesline yesterday, but now it’s straight-up ghosted—it ain’t there no more.”

“i reckon the world’s totally ending. i’ve never seen such chaos in all my days—a shirt, a sheet, a spoon, and six candles—”

“missus,” pipes up a young yellowish wench, “they’re missin’ a brass candlestick.”

“get outta here, you bitch, or imma smack you with a skillet!”

she was straight-up spitting mad. i started eyeing an escape, thinking i’d dip out to the woods until things calmed down. she kept raging, running her whole rebel act solo, while everyone else was chill AF; and finally, uncle silas, lookin’ kinda goofy, fished that spoon outta his pocket. she froze, mouth open and hands up; and i legit wished i was anywhere in jerusalem or somewhere far. but not long after, she goes:

“it’s exactly as i thought. so you had it stashed in your pocket the whole time; and like, you probably got all the other junk in there too. how’d it even get there?”

“i honestly don’t know, sally,” he says, sounding apologetic, “otherwise i’d spill. i was deep into my acts seventeen text before breakfast, and i guess i dropped it there absentmindedly, meant to put my testament in, and it has to be like that ‘cause my testament ain’t there; but i’ll go check—and if the testament’s still there, then i know i didn’t stash it, and that proves i set it down and grabbed the spoon, and—”

“oh, for real, give it a rest! scram now, with all your kit and junk; and don’t even come near me until i get my chill back.”

i’d have peeped that if she even whispered it, let alone shout it out; and i’d have bounced and obeyed if i was already ghost. as we cruised through the sitting room, the old dude picked up his hat, and a shingle-nail dropped on the floor. he just casually scooped it up, set it on the mantel, said nothing, and dipped out. tom caught that move, remembered the spoon, and goes:

“yo, sending stuff via him is dead—he ain’t reliable.”

then he adds, “but he did us a solid with that spoon, even if it was accidental, so we’re gonna hit him back stealth-style—patch up his rat-holes.”

down in the cellar, we had a crazy load of those, and it took us a whole hour, but we nailed the job—tight, on point, shipshape. then we heard footsteps upstairs, snuffed out our light, and dipped into hiding; and here comes the old man himself, clutching a candle in one hand and a bundle of random junk in the other, looking as scatterbrained as ever. he wandered around, first cruising to one rat-hole then another, until he’d scoped ‘em all. he then just stood there for like five minutes, scraping tallow-drip off his candle and deep in thought. finally, he slowly drifted toward the stairs, saying:

“well, for real, i can’t remember when i did it. i could prove i ain’t to blame ‘cause of the rats, but nevermind—let it slide. i figure it wouldn’t do any good anyway.”

so he kept mumbling upstairs, and then we dipped. he was a pretty solid old dude—always is.

tom was seriously stressed about scoring a spoon, but he insisted we needed it; so he cooked up a plan. once his hack was locked in, he filled me in on the blueprint; then we chilled by the spoon basket until we spotted aunt sally coming, and tom started counting the spoons and lining them up on the side, while i stealthily slid one up my sleeve. tom goes:

“yo, aunt sally, looks like there’s only nine spoons so far.”

she snaps:

“get on with your games and don’t bug me. i got this, i counted ’em myself.”

“i swear, i counted ’em twice, aunty, and all i’m seeing is nine.”

she was losing all patience, but of course she came over to count—anyone would. then she yells:

“i declare, there ain’t but nine!” she rants. “what the heck—damn these things, i’m counting ’em again.”

so i slipped back the one i’d stashed, and when she finished counting, she goes:

“dang this pesky trash, now there’s ten!” and she looked super huffy and bothered. but tom drops:

“yo, aunty, i don’t think it’s ten.”

“you dumbass, didn’t you see me count ’em?”

“i know, but—”

“alright, i’ll count ’em again.”

so i crammed one in, and they totaled nine again, just like before. she was literally losing it—trembling mad af. she kept counting till her brain was fried and even started counting in the basket instead of a spoon sometimes; so like, three times they came out right and three times way off. then she grabbed that basket, slammed it across the house, and knocked the cat to the other side; and she barked for everyone to clear out and leave her in peace, warning that if we bothered her again before dinner, she’d skin us raw. so we ended up with an extra odd spoon, which we jacked into her apron pocket while she was laying down our sailing orders, and jim got the scoop too—along with her shingle nail—all before noon. we were hella satisfied with the hustle, and tom admitted it was worth twice the hassle, ‘cause he said now she couldn’t ever count spoons the same way twice in a row to save her life; and she wouldn’t believe her own count even if it was legit—and that after she lost her mind counting for the next three days, she’d probably give up and even offer to off anyone who dared make her count them again.

so that night, we re-hung the sheet on the line, then jacked one out of her closet; and we kept swapping it back and jacking it again for a few days until she lost track of how many sheets she had, and honestly, she didn’t even care—she wasn’t about to lose her entire vibe over it, and wouldn’t count ‘em again to save her life; she’d rather ghost first.

so overall, we were solid on the shirt, the sheet, the spoon, and the candles—thanks to the calf, the rats, and our cray counting hustle; and as for the candlestick, no biggie, it was gonna blow over on its own eventually.

yo, that pie was a massive mission; we were hit with endless drama over that crust, no cap. so we squadrolled deep into the woods to fix that pie up and cooked it right there, and eventually we smashed it out, looking mad fire—but not in one day, fr. we had to drop three whole wash-pan loads of flour before we even got through, and we ended up toasted all over with our eyes practically smoked, all 'cause all we wanted was that crisp crust and we just couldn’t prop it up right—every time that bad boi would cave in. eventually, though, we had a glow-up moment and figured out the fix: just toss the ladder in the pie too, bruh. so on round two with jim, we went full hustle: we shredded the sheet into tiny strings, twisted 'em up, and way before dawn we had a lit rope that you could literally hang somebody with. and we hyped it up like, "nine months of grind, no cap." 

then in the forenoon we hauled that rope back to the woods, but it just wasn’t vibe-ing with the pie. since it was crafted off a whole sheet, we had rope for, like, forty pies if we were flexin’ extra—and plenty extra for soup, sausage, or any munchies you crave. we legit could have thrown down a whole dinner feast. 

but fr, we didn’t need all that extra rope. all we needed was just enough for our pie masterpiece, so we yeeted the surplus without a second thought. we didn’t cook any of the pies in the usual wash-pan—too shook that the solder might melt, bruh—but uncle silas had this baller brass warming-pan he prized hard, since it came down from one of his forebears with a long wooden handle who rolled over from england with william the conqueror on the mayflower or one of those OG ships, all stashed up in the garret with a ton of other vintage relic pots that were priceless not 'cause they made bank, but 'cause they were straight-up antiques, ya feel? so we snaked that bad boy out on the low and took it down there—she flopped on our first pie drops 'cause we were total noobs, but on the final run she came out smirking like a boss. we lined her up with dough, dropped her into the coals, loaded her up with rag rope, slapped on a dough roof, slammed the lid shut, tossed hot embers on top, and then chilled like five feet away, cool and comfy with that long handle—and in just fifteen minutes she popped out a pie that was a straight-up aesthetic flex. real talk, whoever munched that pie would probs need to snag a couple of kags of toothpicks 'cause if that rope ladder doesn’t harsh someone into business, i literally don’t know what i’m even spitting, and it’d hit 'em with enough stomach-ache to last 'til the next round.

nat didn’t even glance when we dropped the witch pie into jim’s pan; and we slid three tin plates at the bottom under the vittles so that jim had everything on fleek. as soon as he was on his own, he busted into the pie, stashed that rope ladder inside his straw tick, scribbled some marks on a tin plate, and yeeted it out the window-hole.

chapter xxxviii.

making them pens was a hella rough grind, and the saw was no picnic either; and jim was all, the inscription was gonna be the hardest part of all. that’s the one a prisoner has gotta tag on the wall. but he had to flex it—tom was like, “bro, you gotta do it,” ‘cause there’s never been a state prisoner who didn’t leave behind his own epic inscription and coat of arms.

“check lady jane grey,” tom spits, “peep gilford dudley; scope out old northumberland! yo, huck, you think this is a major hassle? what you gonna do? how you gonna work around it? jim’s gotta tag his inscription and rock his coat of arms—every single one does, facts.”

jim goes, “yo, mars tom, i ain’t got no coat o’ arms; i ain’t got nothin’ but this crusty old shirt, and you know i gotta keep my journal on deck.”

“yo, you don’t get it, jim; a coat o’ arms is a whole different vibe.”

“well,” i reply, “jim’s facts, fr—he ain’t got a coat o’ arms ‘cause he legit doesn’t.”

“i lowkey knew that,” tom adds, “but bet he’ll snag one before he bounces from here—’cause he’s hustlin’ right, and there’ll be zero flops in his record.”

so while jim and i were grinding away on our pens—jim crafting his outta brass and i from a spoon—tom got busy plotting the coat o’ arms. after a minute he was like, “yo, i got so many dope designs, i can’t even pick one, but i’m feelin’ this one vibe.” and he goes:

“on the scutcheon, we gonna rock a bend in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, as the common charge, and under his foot a chain all embattled for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nay nay, sable, with his bundle slung over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which represent you and me; motto, maggiore fretta, minore atto—snagged straight from a book, meaning ‘the more haste, the less speed.’”

“geewhillikins,” i burst, “but like, what the heck do the rest even mean?”

“we ain’t got time to break that down,” tom snaps; “we gotta dive in full send, no cap.”

“anyways,” i go, “what even is a fess?”

“a fess—a fess is, like, not even important for you to know. i’ll school you on how to craft one when you hit that part.”

“damn, tom, you gotta spill the tea sometimes—what even is a bar sinister?”

“oh, i dunno, but it’s a must-have. all the big ballers in nobility rock it.”

that was just tom being tom. if he wasn’t feelin’ it to break it all down for you, he’d just ghost on the explanation—even if you pestered him for a week, he’d keep it 100.

tom had his coat o’ arms game locked down, so he hopped to finish the rest of the job: planning a sad af inscription—’cause jim had gotta have one just like everyone else. he whipped up a bunch, jotted ‘em on a scrap of paper, and rapped 'em out, like so:

1. here, a captive heart got totally wrecked.  
2. here, a broke prisoner, ghosted by the world and his crew, steamed his sorrowed life.  
3. here, a lonely heart got shattered, and a worn vibe dipped for good after thirty-seven years of solo captivity.  
4. here, stranded and without squad, after thirty-seven years of bitter lockdown, perished a noble stranger—the natural offspring of louis xiv.

tom’s voice shook all over while spitting those lines, and he straight up lost it. when he finished, he couldn’t even pick which one jim should tag on the wall—they were all pure fire; but eventually, he was like, “yo, go ahead and tag ‘em all.” jim was like, “bro, it’d take me a year to nail all that crazy stuff into these logs with a nail, and i legit don’t even know how to craft letters,” but tom was like, “i gotchu—I’ll block it out for you so you just gotta trace the lines, easy peasy.”

then after a minute, tom goes, “yo, thinking it over, logs ain’t cutting it; there ain’t any log walls in a dungeon, bruh—we gotta carve these inscriptions into rock. let’s go snag a rock.”

jim was like, “dude, rock is even more brutal than logs; gonna take me, like, forever to chip these into stone so i never get out.” but tom was like, “chill, i’ll let you help.” then he peeped how jim and i were vibin’ with the pens. gotta say, it was hella annoying, tedious af, and super slow, leaving our hands all sore, and we barely made any progress—so tom goes:

“i got a hack, y’all. we need a rock for the coat o’ arms and for the sad inscriptions, so why not kill two birds with one stone? there’s this extra flashy grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smash it up, carve our dope designs on it, and even file our pens and the saw into it too.”

that idea was not a total flop, and that grindstone was no joke either; so we decided to roll with it. it wasn’t even midnight yet, so we dipped out to the mill, leaving jim on the grind. we smashed the grindstone up, then set out to roll it back home—but dang, it was a mega tough mission. sometimes, even with our best, we couldn’t keep it from toppling over, and it nearly mashed us every time. tom was like, “yo, one of y’all is gonna get wrecked before we finish,” for real. we got it halfway, then we were totally wiped, drenched in sweat. it was clear we had to go fetch jim. so he hoisted his bed, slid the chain off the bed-leg, looped it around his neck, and we crawled out through our escape hole down there, while jim and i took over that grindstone like bosses—with tom superintending like a straight-up legend who knew how to do everything, no cap.

our escape hole was pretty lit, but it wasn’t big enough to roll the grindstone through; so jim grabbed a pick and soon expanded it enough. then tom marked out the design on it with a nail and set jim to work carving, using the nail as a chisel and an iron bolt from the scrap in the lean-to as his hammer, and told him to grind it out till his candle totally dripped away, then he could bounce to bed, stash the grindstone under his straw tick, and crash. afterwards, we helped him fix the chain back on the bed-leg, and we were set for the night. then tom drops, “yo, you got any spiders in here, jim?”

“nah, sah, thank god i ain’t got none,” jim shot back.

“alright, we’ll grab you some.”

“but seriously, bro, i don’t want any. i’m straight-up scared of 'em; i swear, they'd have rattlesnakes lurking around soon enough.”

tom paused for a hot sec, then goes, “yo, that's a solid idea. and i bet it's been done before—it makes total sense. yeah, it's a prime move. where would you even stash it?”

“stash what, mars tom?”

“dude, a rattlesnake.”

“omg, mars tom! like, if a rattlesnake crawled in here, i’d smack it right out that log wall with my head, no cap.”

“yo, jim, trust me, you wouldn’t be shook for long—you could totally tame that beast.”

“tame it!”

“yeah—real simple. every creature vibes with kindness and petting, so they wouldn’t burn someone who’s givin’ them love. any book out there says that. just try—it’s all i ask; try for two or three days. soon enough, you'll have it so chill it’ll be your bae; it’ll sleep with you, never ghost you, and even let you wrap it around your neck and, i dunno, put its head in your mouth.”

“plz, mars tom—don’t go like that! i can’t even deal! if it ended up letting me shove its head in my mouth, wouldn’t that be hella weird? i bet it’d wait forever before i even ask. plus, i seriously don’t want it crashing with me.”

“jim, don’t be trippin'. a prisoner gotta have some whack pet, and if no one’s ever tried a rattlesnake, you’d be pioneering major glory—way more lit than any other trick to boost your survival game.”

“yo, mars tom, i’m not about that glory. if that snake bites my chin clean off, where’s the flex then? i ain’t down for that drama.”

“come on, why not give it a shot? i just want you to try—it doesn’t have to be forever if it flops.”

“but dude, if that snake bites me while i’m trying, man, that’s a whole other level of trouble. mars tom, i’m down for almost anything, but if you and huck bring a rattlesnake in here for me to tame, i’m straight bailing, no cap.”

“alright, then, if you’re that stubborn, let it slide. we can hook you up with some garter snakes instead—tie some buttons on their tails, pretend they’re rattlesnakes—and that’ll just have to do.”

“i don’t even stan those, mars tom, but if i can’t roll without ‘em, then i’m screwed. i never knew being a prisoner would be such a hassle and a whole lot of drama.”

“yo, it’s always wild when it’s done proper. you got any rats around here?”

“nah, sah, i haven’t peeped any.”

“alright, we’ll hook you up with some rats.”

“yo, mars tom, i ain’t about rats. they’re the most cringe creatures—always tryna mess with you, bump around, and chomp your feet when you’re just tryin’ to sleep, no cap. nah, if i gotta have one, give me garter snakes, but don’t hit me with rats; i got zero use for 'em, seriously.”

“but jim, you gotta have ‘em—they’re a staple. so quit the side-eye. every prisoner’s got rats; like, there isn’t a single case otherwise. they even train 'em, pet 'em, and teach 'em tricks—they get as chill as flies. but you gotta set the mood with music. you got anything to jam on?”

“i ain’t got much besides a coarse comb, a scrap of paper, and a juice-harp; but i doubt anyone would vibe with a juice-harp, tbh.”

“nah, they would. they don’t care what music is playin’. a jews-harp’s plenty fire for a rat. all animals, even locked up ones, straight up love music—they’re all about it, especially raw, pained vibes; and you can’t even bust any other tune from a jews-harp. it always pulls ‘em in—they’ll come out to see what’s up with you. trust, you’re on point; set up your bed sessions a few nights before sleep and first thing in the mornin’, and jam out on that jews-harp; play “the last link is broken”—that track will scoop rats faster than anything else; and after like two minutes, you’ll see all the rats, snakes, spiders, and whatever get all jittery ‘bout you and swarm over like nobody’s business.”

“facts, they will, i guess, mars tom, but what time is jim even on? damn, i can’t peep the clock. but i’ll do it if i gotta—i better keep these critters hyped so there’s no drama in the crib.”

tom chilled for a minute to think it over, then goes, “oh, btw, i forgot one thing. you reckon you could grow a flower here?”

“i dunno, maybe i could, mars tom; but it’s mad dark in here, and i got zero use for a flower, plus it’d be a total hassle.”

“aight, just try it anyway. some other prisoners have pulled that off.”

“one of those big cat-tail lookin’ mullen stalks would probably pop up here, mars tom, but it wouldn’t be nearly the drama it’d cause, no cap.”

“believe it. we’ll snag you a lil one, have you plant it in the corner over there, and watch it grow. and don’t call it mullen—call it pitchiola, that’s its legit prison name. and yo, you gotta water it with your tears.”

“yo, i got tons of spring water, mars tom.”

“nah, you don’t want spring water; you gotta water it with your tears—that’s just how it’s always done.”

“man, mars tom, i swear i could raise one of those mullen stalks just fine with spring water while somebody else is busy starting one with tears.”

“that ain’t the move. you gotta do it with tears, period.”

“she’ll straight up die on my account, mars tom, no cap; 'cause i literally never cry, fr.”

so tom was totally stumped. he mulled it over and then said jim would just have to deal with an onion instead. he promised he’d hit up the nay nay cabins and drop one lowkey in jim’s coffee-pot in the morning. jim was like, “i’ll just have my coffee all mixed up,” and ended up finding tons of issues with it—and with the whole hassle of raising the mullen, playing jews-harp for the rats, petting and hyping up the snakes and spiders, on top of all the other grind with pens, inscriptions, journals, and whatnot, making being a prisoner the ultimate mega grind of worry and responsibility—so tom straight lost his chill, saying jim was loaded down with more flashy chances to flex his name than any prisoner ever gets, yet he couldn’t even appreciate 'em. jim felt bad and promised not to act that way again, and then tom and i peaced out for bed.

chapter xxxix.

in the morning, we hit up the village, copped a wire rat-trap, dragged it back, and busted open the dopest rat-hole; in like an hour, we scored fifteen of the baddest rats out there. then we tucked 'em safely under aunt sally’s bed. but while we were off ghosting for spiders, lil thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps popped by, checked out the spot, and opened the door to see if the rats would roll out—and they did; aunt sally strolled in, and when we got back she was posted up on top of the bed causing absolute mayhem, with the rats doing their best to kill the boredom for her. so she came in and dusted us both with hickory, and we ended up grinding for like two hours to snag another fifteen or sixteen—damn that meddlesome cub—and honestly, they weren’t even as lit as the first haul, which was the absolute pick of the crop. i never peeped a rat crew more next-level than that primo stash.

we then copped a wicked stock of sorted spiders, bugs, frogs, caterpillars, and a whole bunch of random critters—and we kinda wished we had snagged a hornet’s nest, but nah. the fam was chillin’ at home, so we stuck around as long as we could, ‘cause we figured we’d tire ‘em out or they’d tire us out, and they totally did. then we got all allycumpain and rubbed off on the places, and things were nearly vibe-check perfect again, even if we couldn’t set up proper digs. so we dipped for the snakes, grabbed a couple dozen garter and house snakes, tossed ‘em in a bag, and stashed it in our room—and by that time it was supper time, after a rattling good, honest day’s work. hungry? nah, i reckon not! and when we rolled back, not a single snake was chillin’ up there—we barely tied the sack, and they somehow dipped out. but it didn’t even matter ‘cause snakes were still lurking somewhere in the crib. so we figured we could snag some more again. for real, there was zero scarcity of snakes around the house for a hot minute. you’d see ‘em dripping off the rafters and random spots every now and then; they’d even drop into your plate or sneak down the back of your neck—always showing up where you least expect ‘em. yo, they were mad handsome and striped, and a million snakes ain’t no harm, but that never changed aunt sally’s vibe; she straight up despised snakes—no matter the breed—and couldn’t stand ‘em in any shape or form; every time one flopped down on her, no matter what she was doing, she would just drop it all and bolt. i never peeped a woman like that. you could hear her holler all the way to jericho. you couldn’t even get her to grab one with tongs—and if she flipped and found one in bed, she’d scramble out and let loose a howl like you’d think the whole house was on fire. she riled the old man so bad he said he just wished snakes had never been created. like, even after every last snake was hustled out of the house for a week, aunt sally still wasn’t over it—she was still hella triggered; you could even tap her neck with a feather and she’d jump right out of her stockings. it was mad wild. but tom was like, “all women are just built that way.” he claimed they were made like that for some reason or another.

we got smacked down every time one of our snakes slid into her lane, and she was chill with those beatdowns ‘cause they were just a lil’ taste of what she'd drop if we ever crammed the crib with ‘em again. ngl, i wasn’t even shook by the clobbering ‘cause it was nothing major; but i was totally vexed by the extra hassle we had to hustle up another load. but yo, we got it all lined up and all the extra chaos too; and seriously, you ain’t ever peeped a shack as hype as jim’s when the whole squad would swarm out to blast tunes and go off on him. jim wasn’t about that spider life, and the spiders were low-key beefin’ with jim; so they’d always throw down some extra heat for him. and he was like, between the rats, the snakes, and that relentless grindstone, there was literally zero chill space in bed for him, no cap; and even when there was a spot, sleep was a myth ‘cause one crew was always on duty – like, when the snakes were catching z’s, the rats were all over the job, and when the rats crashed, the snakes clocked in – so he always had one gang messin’ with him and the other throwin’ a non-stop rave, and if he ever tried to dip to a new spot the spiders would totally risk him crossing over. he swore that if he ever bounced this time, he’d never be locked down again, not even for a paycheck.

yo, by the end of three weeks everything was looking pretty tight. the shirt got dropped early, snug in a pie, and every time a rat munched on jim, he’d bounce up to scribble some lines in his journal while the ink was still fire; our pens were crafted on point, and all the inscriptions and doodles were straight carved on that grindstone; we even hacked a bed-leg in two, raked up all that sawdust, and it hit us with the most insane stomach cramp ever. we legit thought we were gonna yeet ourselves outta there, but nope. that sawdust was hands down the most undigestible, cringe-inducing mess i’ve ever peeped; and tom was vibing the same.

but yo, as i was saying, we’d wrapped up all the work, at last; and we were all hella zonked, especially jim. the old man had hit up the plantation below orleans a couple times to come scoop up their runaway nay nay, but didn’t get a single clap back, ‘cause low-key that plantation was a straight-up myth; so he dipped and was like, "i’mma advertise jim in the st. louis and new orleans papers," and when he dropped the st. louis deets it gave me total chills, so i peeped that we had zero time to waste. then tom chimed in, "aight, now for the nonnamous letters."

“what’s them?” i asked, all curious.

“they’re warnings to the peeps that somethin’ major’s poppin’. sometimes it’s dropped one way, sometimes another—but there’s always some nosy snoop peepin’ around to tip off the governor of the castle. remember when louis xvi was about to dip out of the tooleries? a servant girl did it. it’s a mad smart move, and these nonnamous letters work the same. we’ll flex both moves. plus, it’s standard for the prisoner’s mom to swap threads with him so she stays in while he ghost in her fit. we’re gonna roll with that too.”

“but yo, tom, why warn someone that somethin’s up? let ‘em figure it out on their own—it’s their own lookout.”

“yeah, i feel you; but you can’t really count on them. ever since day one they’ve left us hanging, doing all the heavy lifting. they’re so trusting and, like, full-on mullet-brained, they don’t even peep what’s goin’ on. so if we don’t drop a heads up, there’ll be zero interference, and after all our grind this escape will go off slick—no drama, nothing extra.”

“as for me, tom, that’s exactly the vibe i’m down with.”

“shucks!” he snapped, lookin’ all disgusted. so i was like:

“i ain’t gonna throw shade, whatever works for you works for me. so what’s the plan with the servant-girl?”

“you’re gonna be her. just slide in dead midnight and jack that yaller girl’s frock.”

“yo, tom, that’s gonna stir up mad drama the next morn; ‘cause obviously she probably only rocks that one outfit.”

“i know; but you only need it for like fifteen minutes—to hustle the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”

“alright, then, i’ll roll with it; but i could just as easily carry it in my own fit.”

“you wouldn’t be pulling that servant-girl look then, would you?”

“nah, but honestly, no one’s gonna peep what i’m rockin’, anyway.”

“that’s not the point. our job is just to do our duty, no cap, without stressing whether anyone catches us in the act. don’t you got any principle, brah?”

“alright, i ain’t dropping any further words; i’m your servant-girl. so, whose jim’s mom?”

“i’m his mom. i’ll snag a gown from aunt sally.”

“then you gotta crash in the cabin when jim and i dip.”

“low-key, here’s the twist: i’ll jack jim’s gear, pack it with straw, and lay it on his bed to pose as his mom in disguise, and jim’ll swipe the nay nay woman’s gown off of me and rock it—so we all dip together. when a style prisoner escapes, it’s called an evasion. it’s always called that when a king bails, for real. and same goes for a king’s kid; whether he’s natural or not don’t mean a thing.”

so tom scribbled up the nonnamous letter, and that night i smooshed the yaller wench’s frock, threw it on, and shoved it under the front door just like tom said. it read:

beware. trouble is brewing. keep a sharp lookout. unknown friend.

the very next night we slapped up a pic—which tom drew in blood—of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and the following night, another one of a coffin on the back door. i never witnessed a fam so shook. they were legit tripping, like, they’d have been even more scared if the place was crawling with ghosts lurking behind every corner, under every bed, shivering in the air. if a door banged, aunt sally would jump and go “ouch!”; if anything fell, same deal—“ouch!”; and if someone dared touch her when she wasn’t peeping, she’d do the same. she couldn’t just be cool ‘cause she was sure something was lurking behind her every second—so she’d spin around all sudden, going “ouch,” and before she even got two-thirds of the way around she’d spin back and drop another “ouch;” and she was so shook she couldn’t even crash at night, but she still wouldn’t bunk down. so the setup was working mad well, tom declared; he said he’d never peeped something work more on point. he said it proved it was done right.

then tom goes, "now for the grand bulge!" so the next morning at the very crack of dawn we prepped another letter, wondering what our next move should be, ‘cause we heard them at supper saying they were gonna station a nay nay on watch at both doors all night. tom bounced down the lightning-rod to scope it out; and the nay nay at the back door was catching z’s, so he jacked it by the back of his neck and bounced back up. this letter said:

don’t betray me, i wish to be your friend. there’s a desperate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory set to snatch your runaway nay nay tonight, and they’ve been flexin’ scares to keep you locked in the house so you won’t hassle them. i’m part of the gang, but i’ve caught the religion bug and wanna bail and live honest, so i’m gonna rat out the helish scheme. they’ll sneak down from the north, along the fence, at the stroke of midnight with a bogus key and bust into the nay nay’s cabin to grab him. i’m supposed to bounce off and toot a tin horn if i peep any danger; but instead, i’ll ba like a sheep as soon as they roll in and keep it on mute; then, while they’re busy unchaining him, you roll in, lock ‘em up, and handle them when you’re ready. just do exactly as i say—if you deviate, they’ll catch on and throw some serious whoop-jamboreehoo. i don’t need no reward, just knowing i did the righteous thing.

unknown friend

chapter xl.

yo, after a bomb breakfast, we were feeling hella chill, so i grabbed my canoe and dipped over the river to fish with a lunch packed along, having a mad good time. we even scoped out the raft and it was all Gucci, then we rolled back home late for supper—only to find the joint was in a total sweat fest, with everyone so panicky they didn’t even know which way was up. they bounced us straight to bed the minute we finished grubbin’, not spillin’ a single deet ‘bout the crisis or that fresh letter, but it was all obvious to us. once we were halfway up the stairs and had the back turned, we slid over to the cellar cupboard, hoisted a killer lunch, hauled it to our room, crashed hard, and then rolled out around half-past eleven. then tom busted out aunt sally’s dress he jacked and was ‘bout to kick off the lunch vibe when he goes:

“where’s the butter?”

“i laid a hunk of it,” i say, “on a piece of corn-pone.”

“well, you left it laid out then—it ain’t here.”

“we can roll without it,” i say.

“nah, we need it too—just slide down to the cellar and snag it. then mosey back down the lightning-rod. i’mma go stuff straw into jim’s threads to mimic his mom in disguise, get ready to ba like a sheep, and dip as soon as you land.”

so off he bounced, and i dipped down to the cellar. the butter hunk, as big as a fist, was exactly where i’d dropped it, so i grabbed that corn-pone slab with the butter on deck, snuffed out my light, and crept upstairs all stealth-mode, making it to the main floor without drama—until aunt sally stormed in with a candle. i immediately clipped my ride in my hat, re-hatted myself, and the next sec she peeped me; she goes:

“you been down in the cellar?”

“yep.”

“what you been up to down there?”

“noth’n.”

“noth’n!”

“yep.”

“then what got you going down there at this freakin’ hour?”

“i dunno.”

“you dunno? don’t hit me with that. tom, i wanna know what you been doing down there.”

“i ain’t been doing a damn thing, aunt sally, i swear.”

i figured she’d let it slide, and normally she would; but i guess with all the wild stuff going on, she was trippin’ over every little thing that wasn’t perfect. so she snapped, dead set:

“you just march into that sitting room and crash there till i come back. you been up to some shady business, and i swear i’m gonna get to the bottom of it before i’m done with you.”

so she bounced while i opened the door and slid into the sitting room. damn, there was a whole posse there! like fifteen farmers, each packing a piece, all lined up. i was hella shook, so i slunk into a chair to play it low-key. they were all gathered, some whispering in low voices, all jittery and off their game, trying to act chill—but i peeped that they were messin’ up hard, constantly doffing and redoing their hats, scratching their heads, switching seats, and fidgetin’ with their buttons. i was nervous too, but i kept my hat on, no doubt.

i legit wished aunt sally would just roll in, wrap me up, and end this drama already, let me bounce and clue tom in on how we totally overdid this whole frenzy, and what a hornet’s nest of chaos we were in—so we could stop clowning around and dip with jim before these fools’ patience snapped.

finally, she stomped back and started grillin’ me with questions, but i couldn’t spit straight answers—I was so twisted up i didn’t know which part of me was even in play; these dudes were so on edge, some ready to jump up and go full savage on them desperadoes, yelling it was just minutes to midnight; while others were begging them to hold up for that secret sheep-signal; and there was aunt sally, hammering away at questions, and me tremblin’ so bad i was ready to melt into the floor, it was that intense—plus the heat was cranked all the way up and the butter started melting, dripping down my neck and behind my ears; and soon, when one of them piped up, “i’m bout to roll into the cabin right now and nab them when they appear,” i nearly dropped; a slick trail of butter started trickling down my forehead, and aunt sally peeped it, turning as white as a ghost, and she goes:

“for the love of all that’s holy, what’s up with you, child? you’re rockin’ a straight-up brain-meltdown like you were never even born, and your brain juice is oozing out!”

and every single one of them rushed over to check, as she snatched off my hat, spilled out the bread and what was left of the butter, grabbed me, gave me a tight hug, and said:

“oh, what a flip you did on me! i’m hella relieved it ain’t worse; ‘cause luck’s totally against us, and when it rains, it pours—and when i saw that slab, i thought we’d lost you, ‘cause i knew by the color that your brains were done if—dear, dear, why didn’t you tell me that’s what you were down there for? i wouldn’t have cared one bit. now haul your ass to bed, and don’t let me see you ‘til mornin’!”

in a flash, i bounced upstairs, then down the lightning-rod in a heartbeat, creeping through the dark to the lean-to. i could barely get words out, so anxious was i; but i managed to tell tom ASAP that we had to jump for it now—no time to waste, the house was packed with dudes armed to the teeth!

his eyes straight lit up, and he goes:

“no!—is that for real? damn, huck, if i had a redo on this, i bet i could score two hundred! if we could push it off til—”

“hurry! hurry!” i bark. “where’s jim?”

“right at your elbow; stretch out and you can feel him. he’s dressed up, and everything’s set. now we’re gonna slide out and drop the sheep-signal.”

but then we peeped the heavy tramp of boots coming to the door, heard them fumbling with the padlock, and a dude shout:

“who’s that? answer me, or i’ll spray!”

but we kept it 100 and didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and dipped. next, came a mad rush, and a bang, bang, bang! bullets whizzin’ all over the place! we heard them holler:

“yo, here they are! they broke for the river! after ’em, boys, and let loose the dogs!”

so here they come, full tilt. we could hear ‘em ‘cause they were rockin’ boots and hollerin’, but we weren’t about that noise life—we were locked on the path to the mill; and when they got close enough, we dodged into the brush and let them pass, then trailed right behind. they’d had all the dogs muzzled so they wouldn’t alert the robbers; but by then someone had let those puppies off, and they came in with a pow-wow loud enough to shake the net, but they were our own dogs; so we froze until they caught up; and when they peeped it was just us, with zero hype to offer, they just gave a casual “howdy” and tore ahead towards the chaos; then we peaced up-stream again, zoomed after them nearly to the mill, and then dipped into the bush to where my canoe was tied, hopped in, and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, making as little noise as we had to. then we cruised out easy and comfortable, making tracks for the island where my raft was docked; and we could hear them yellin’ and barkin’ up and down the bank, ‘til we were so far off the sound just faded into nothing. once we stepped onto the raft, i declared:

“now, old jim, you’re free again, for real—and i bet you’ll never be a slave no more.”

“en, that job was straight-fire too, huck. it was planned on fleek, executed even more so; and nah, no one can cook up a plan as dope and bonkers as that one.”

we were all hella stoked, but tom was the happiest of all ‘cause he had a bullet chillin’ in his calf.

when jim and i peeped that, we weren’t as cocky as before. it was seriously wounding him, bleeding and hurting bad; so we laid him out in the wigwam and jacked one of the duke’s shirts to use as a bandage, but he goes:

“gimme the rags; i got this on lock. don’t even stop now; no fooling around, and this evasion is booming so smooth—man the sweeps and set her loose! bros, we pulled it off elegant-like! for real, we did. i wish we had the finesse of louis xvi—then there’d be no “son of saint louis, ascend to heaven!” scribbled in his bio; nah, sir, we’d have whooped him over the border—that’s exactly what we’d do, slick as nothing at all. man the sweeps—man the sweeps!”

but jim and i started huddling and thinking. and after a minute i said:

“say it, jim.”

so he goes:

“yo, huck, here’s how i see it. if it had been him getting all ultra-free, and one of the boys was ‘bout to get shot, would he be like, ‘go on and save me, and don’t even trip about a doctor coming to rescue me?’ like, is that what our boy mars tom would do? nah, he wouldn’t! so then, is jim really gonna spit that? nah—i ain’t budgin’ an inch outta this spot without a doctor; not even if it’s been forty freakin’ years!”

i knew he was pure white inside, and i figured he’d drop what he meant—so it was all set, and i told tom i was rolling for a doctor. he started throwing major fits about it, but jim and i stuck solid and wouldn’t move an inch; so he was ready to crawl out and set the raft loose on his own—but we weren’t having it. then he laid into us a bit, but it didn’t do a damn thing.

so when he sees me gearing up the canoe, he goes:

“alright then, if you’re bound to bounce, i’ll drop the cheat code for when you hit the village. shut the door and blindfold that doc tight and fast; make him swear to be as silent as the grave, slap a purse full of gold in his hand, then lead him around every back alley and dark corner in the hood, and then scoop him up in the canoe, taking the long way ‘round the islands, search him and jack his chalk so you don’t give it back ‘til you’re back in the village, or else he’ll just mark this raft so he can track it down later. that’s the play—everyone does it that way.”

so i was like, “bet,” and bounced, while jim was set to ghost into the woods when he peeped the doc coming, and stay hidden until he vanished.

chapter xli.

the doc was one of those old school dudes; a genuinely nice, kind-lookin’ old man when i hauled him up. i told him that me and my bro had been chillin’ on spanish island huntin’ yesterday afternoon, camped on a random piece of raft we scored, and that ‘round midnight his gun totally went off in his dream—like, it legit shot him in the leg—and we needed him to roll over there, fix that mess, and keep it on the down low, no cap, ‘cause we wanted to roll back home this evenin’ and totally surprise the folks.

“who’s your folks?” he asked.

“the phelpses, down yonder.”

“oh,” he replied. then after a minute he goes:

“how’d you say he got shot?”

“he was dreamin’, and his dream straight-up shot him,” i answered.

“singular dream,” he muttered.

so he lit up his lantern, grabbed his saddle-bags, and we bounced. but when he peeped the canoe, he wasn’t feeling its vibe—said it was big enough for one ride but looked sus for two. i was like:

yo, don’t even stress, sir, that ride carried the whole squad like it was no biggie. 

“what three?”  
“yo, it’s me, sid, and, uh, the guns – that’s what i’m sayin’.” 

“oh,” he goes, but then he drops his foot on the boat’s gunnel, starts rockin’ her like a seasoned pro, shakes his head, and goes, “i’mma scope out a bigger ride.” but all the gear was locked down and chained up tight, so he scooped my canoe and told me, “chill till i bounce back, or go ghost around some more, or even dip home and prep for the epic surprise if that’s your vibe.” i was like, “nah, i’m good,” so i dropped the deets on how to find the raft and then he dipped.

i peeped an idea real quick. i was thinkin’, if he can’t fix that busted leg in like three shakes of a sheep’s tail (you know the meme), and it ends up takin’ him like three or four days, then what’s the move? you just gonna sit and wait for him to spill all the tea? nah, fam; i got a plan. i’ll just hold it down, and when he rolls back and goes, “i gotta dip,” i’ll dive in—even if i gotta swim—and we’ll snare him, tie him up, and push his sorry behind down the river; then when tom’s done with him, we’ll cash out whatever we got and let him hit shore.

so i snuck into a lumber pile to catch some z’s; next thing i know, the sun’s flexin’ high above my head! i bolted out and cruised over to the doc’s pad, but they were like, “nah, he bounced sometime during the night and ain’t back yet.” i was like, that’s super sus for tom, so i bounced straight to the island. as i turned the corner, i nearly clowned myself and bumped into uncle silas’s gut!

he goes, “yo, tom! where you been, you little rascal?” 

“i ain’t been nowhere,” i say, “just on the prowl huntin’ that runaway nay nay—with sid.” 

“so, where’d you dip off to? your auntie was hella uneasy.” 

“she ain’t gotta be, cuz we were all good. we followed the dudes and the dogs, but they totally outsped us and we lost ’em; then we thought we caught a vibe of ‘em floatin’ on the water, so we snagged a canoe, chased after ‘em, crossed over, but came up empty; so we cruised along the shore till we got beat, tied up the canoe, and crashed hard—only wakin’ up about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to catch the tea, with sid on detective duty at the post office trying to sniff out deets, and me off to snag some grub, then we bounce home.”

so we hit up the post office to scoop sid, but, low-key, he was MIA. the old dude pulled a letter out of the office and we chilled a bit longer, but sid still ghosted. then the old man was like, “yo, let sid hoof it back home or canoe it when he’s done clownin’, but y’all gotta ride.” i tried to stall for sid, but he shut it down – “ain’t no point, you gotta bounce with us and show aunt sally we’re straight.”

when we rolled up to the crib, aunt sally was hyped as heck to see me; she was laughin’, cryin’, and hugging me like a boss, dishing out one of them affectionate smooches that don’t really count as beatdowns, and she promised to serve sid the same realness when he got in.

the place was packed with farmer peeps and their wifeys for dinner—a group chat vibe like no one’s ever seen. old mrs. hotchkiss was a hot mess, her mouth on nonstop troll mode. she blurts: 

“well, sister phelps, i went through that air cabin up there and, no cap, that nay nay was straight-up bonkers. i told sister damrell—didn’t i, sister damrell?—yeah, he’s totally off his rocker; everything about him screams crazy. peep that grindstone, fam; you seriously expect anyone in their right mind to scribble mad loco stuff on a grindstone? like, damn, someone’s been heartbroken for, like, thirty-seven years or whatever—some random son of louis or some eternal trash. dude’s straight-up nuts, i was sayin’ it then, in the middle, and at the end too—this nay nay is crazy crazy, crazy as nebokoodneezer.”

“and check that rag ladder made outta scraps, sister hotchkiss,” old mrs. damrell chimes in, “what on god’s name could he even need that for—”

“yo, i was literally just spillin’ this tea to sister utterback, and she vibes with it too. peep that rag ladder; like, what did he even wanna do with it? sister hotchkiss, you feel me—”

“but fr, how the heck did they even drop that grindstone in there? and who even dug that hole? who—”

“ayyo, my words, brer penrod! i was straight-up sayin’—pass that extra class, ya feel?—i was just askin’ sister dunlap right now, how did they get that grindstone in there all by themselves? no cap, i bet a whole squad helped out; i’d tear down every single nay nay in this joint just to peep who did it, no cap; and moreover—”

“a dozen, you say? nah, even forty wouldn’t cover all that work. peep those case-knife saws and the extra details; look at that bed-leg hacked off—a week’s grind for six bros; and peep that nay nay turned into a straw bed—yo, and—”

“you can say that, brer hightower! it’s exactly what i was tellin’ brer phelps himself. sister hotchkiss, what’s your take? brer phelps, think about that bed-leg chopped off like that—i swear it didn’t just fall off by itself; someone actually sawed it, no cap; that’s my vibe—take it or leave it, might not be gospel, but that’s how i see it. if anyone can drop a better theory, let ‘em try. i was spillin’ these deets to sister dunlap—”

“yo, dog my cats, there must’ve been a whole house full of nay nay in there every night for like four weeks to pull off all that madness, sister phelps. peep that shirt—every inch scribbled with some secret african text done in blood! bet they were busy on that non-stop. i’d drop two bucks to have it read to me; and as for the nay nay who penned it, i swear i’d cuff every single one of ‘em—”

someone goes, “yo, doc, that sounds lit, i’m vibe-checking that.” then the rest of the crew chilled out a bit, and i was mad thankful to that old doc for doing jim such a solid; i was stoked it matched my own vibe of him, ‘cause i always thought he had a dope heart from day one. so everyone agreed that jim had played his role big time and deserved a shout-out and mad props. they all straight-up promised, full-on, that they wouldn’t drop any more harsh words on him.

then they hauled him out and locked him up. i low-key hoped they’d ease up—maybe ditch a chain or two ‘cause they were hella heavy, or even hook him up with some meat and greens with his bread and water—but nah, they didn’t even consider it, and i figured best not to meddle. i vowed i’d slide the doc’s full yarn to aunt sally as soon as i navigated through the breakers just ahead, to drop the tea on how i totally forgot to mention sid got shot when me and him were paddlin’ hard that wild night hunting the runaway nay nay.

i had plenty of time, though. aunt sally holed up in the sickroom all day and night, and every time i spotted uncle silas mooning around, i dipped.

next mornin’, word was tom was way better, and they said aunt sally dipped for a nap. so i slid over to the sickroom thinkin’ if i found him awake, we could spin a story for the fam that would fly. but he was deep asleep—mad peaceful and pale, way less feisty than his usual self. so i sat and waited for him to wake. in about half an hour, aunt sally glides in, and there i am, right back on deck! she signals for me to keep it low, sits beside me, and starts whisperin’, sayin’ we can all chill now ‘cause his symptoms were 10/10, and he’d been in that deep sleep forever, lookin’ smoother and more peaceful by the second, and like, ten out of ten, he’d wake up on point.

then, when i bounced up to crash, she came over, grabbed her candle, tucked me in proper, and mothered me so hard i felt all kinds of guilty—like, i couldn’t even peep her face; she then sat on the bed and chatted for a hot minute, goin’ on about how amazeballs sid was, and she literally couldn’t stop talkin’ ‘bout him. every now and then, she’d ask if i thought he might’ve gotten lost, hurt, or even drowned—like, maybe he was out there suffering or straight-up dead right now with no one to help—her tears droppin’ silent while i reassured her that sid was chill and would be home by morn, for sure; she’d squeeze my hand, maybe drop a kiss, and tell me to say it all over again ‘cause it calmed her down, since she was so stressed. and as she was bouncin’ off, she locked eyes with me, steady and soft, and goes, 

“the door ain’t gonna be locked, tom, and there’s the window and the rod; but you’re gonna be good, right? and you ain’t gonna bounce? for my sake.”

lawd, i was hella hyped to check on tom and was ready to jet, but after that, i straight-up bailed—i wouldn’t go, not even for kingdoms.

still, she was on my mind and tom was on my mind, so i slept all restless. twice in the night, i slid down that rod, crept around the front, and peeped her chillin’ by the window with her candle, eyes glued to the road and filled with tears; i wished i could do something for her, but i was stuck, only swearin’ i’d never do anything to stress her out again. then on the third try at dawn, i woke, slid down, and caught her still there, candle nearly burnt out, her old gray dome resting on her hand, deep asleep.

chapter xlii.

the old man popped back uptown before brekkie but couldn’t track tom down; so both of ‘em sat at the table in silence, lookin’ hella gloomy, their coffee gettin’ cold while they skipped the chow. after a minute, the old man goes, “did i hand you the letter?”

“what letter?”

“the one i snagged from the post office yesterday.”

“nah, you didn’t drop any letter on me.”

“well, i must’ve forgotten it.” so he rummaged through his pockets, bounced off to where he’d left it, grabbed it, and handed it over. she goes, “yo, it’s from st. petersburg—it’s from sis.”

i figured another walk would chill me out, but i was frozen. before she could even open it, she dropped it and bolted—‘cause she peeped something. and so did i. turns out, it was tom sawyer loungin’ on a mattress; that old doc; and jim, rockin’ a calico dress with his hands tied behind him; plus a whole crew of people. i stashed the letter behind the first thing that came to hand and bolted. she jumped on tom, cryin’, and goes, 

“oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, i know he’s dead!”

tom turned his head a bit, muttering some shady stuff that showed he wasn’t in his right mind; then she threw her hands up and goes, 

“he’s alive, thank god! and that’s it!” and she snagged a kiss off him, then jetting off to the crib to get the bed prepped, scatterin’ orders left and right at the nay nay and everyone else, faster than her tongue could spit.

i trailed the crew to peep what they were gonna do with jim; the old doc and uncle silas followed after tom into the house. the dudes were mad heated—some were ready to hang jim as a warning to all the other nay nay out there so none would ghost like jim and stir up a crazy mess, keepin’ a whole fam shook for days and nights. but the rest were like, “nah, that ain’t it; he ain’t our nay nay, and his owner would show up and make us cough up cash, for real.” that cooled the vibe a bit, ‘cause honestly, the folks hyped to hang a nay nay for messin’ up are usually the very ones who ain’t down to drop mad dough when they finally get their satisfaction.

they were cussin’ jim heavy, smacking him on the head every once in a while, but jim kept hush and never gave me the once-over. they hauled him to the same cabin, shuffled his own threads on him, chained him up AGAIN—not to a bed-leg this time but to a massive staple driven into the bottom log, chaining his hands and both legs—and decreed he’d have nothing but bread and water ’til his owner showed up, or else he’d be auctioned off if he didn’t clock in time. then they padded our hole and arranged for a couple of farmer dudes with guns to stand watch around the cabin every night, with a bulldog strapped to the door by day.

around then, they wrapped up with a bunch of farewell cussin’, and then the old doc rolls in to scope it out, saying, “yo, don’t be harsher than you gotta be, cuz this nay nay ain’t all that bad. when i got to the kid, i seen i couldn’t yank the bullet out on my own—needed backup—and he was in no shape for me to dip and grab help; he kept gettin’ worse, lost his head, and wouldn’t let me near him, even threatenin’ to off me if i messed with his raft—mad wild stuff. so i said, i need help ASAP; and the minute i put it out there, this nay nay crawled in from nowhere and offered to help, and he totally nailed it. obviously, i figured he must be a runaway nay nay, and there i was, stuck on this grind all day and night. it was a fix, i tell you! i had a couple of patients with the chills, and sure, i wanted to jet to town to check on ‘em, but i couldn’t, ‘cause the nay nay might dip and then it’d all be on me; and no skiff came close enough for me to hail. so i had to hang tight until dawn this mornin’. i’ve never seen a nay nay as down-to-earth or real as him—despite risking his freedom, he was exhausted and clearly been hustlin’ hard. i dug the nay nay for that; a nay nay like him is worth a thousand dollars—and solid vibes too. i had everything i needed, and the kid was doin’ just as well as he would back home—maybe even better ’cause it was mad quiet; but there i was, stuck with both of ‘em till about dawn this mornin’. then some dudes in a skiff roll by, and luck be jacked—the nay nay was chillin’ by the pallet, head propped on his knees, fast asleep; so i signaled the crew on the low, they snuck up on him, grabbed him, and tied him up before he knew what hit him, and we had zero drama. since the kid was in a deep, half-asleep haze, we muffled the oars, hitched the raft, and towed her over all smooth, and the nay nay didn’t make a peep or row a single bit from start to finish. he ain’t a bad nay nay, gentlemen; that’s my take on him.”

someone goes, “yo, doc, that sounds lit, i’m vibe-checking that.” then the others chilled out a bit, and i was mad thankful to that old doc for doin’ jim such a solid; i was stoked it matched my own vibe of him, ‘cause i always thought he had a dope heart from day one. so everyone agreed that jim had played his role big time and deserved a proper shout-out and reward. they all straight-up promised, all in, that they wouldn’t drop any more cussin’ on him.

then they hauled him out and locked him up. i was low-key hopin’ they’d slack off on the chains ‘cause they were hella heavy or even hook him up with some meat and greens along with his bread and water; but nah, they didn’t even think of it. i figured it wasn’t best for me to mix in, so i vowed i’d slide the doc’s full yarn to aunt sally as soon as i navigated past those breakers ahead—basically, to drop the deets on how i totally forgot to mention sid got shot when me and him were paddlin’ that wild night chasing the runaway nay nay.

i had plenty of time anyway. aunt sally stuck to the sickroom all day and night, and every time i saw uncle silas mooning around, i dodged him.

next morning, word was tom was way better, and they said aunt sally dipped out for a nap. so i slid over to the sickroom, thinkin’ if i caught him awake, we could spin a story for the fam that would fly. but he was deep asleep—mad peaceful and looking all pale instead of his usual fiery self. so i sat down and waited for him to wake. in about half an hour, aunt sally glides in, and there i am, back on deck! she signals for me to chill, sits beside me, and starts whisperin’, sayin’ we can all vibe now ‘cause his symptoms are 10/10, he’s been in that deep sleep forever, and he’s lookin’ smoother and more peaceful by the sec—like, ten out of ten, he’ll wake up all proper.

yo, that’s it.

so we were just chillin', eyes glued, and after a hot minute my bro stirred a bit, popped his lids open all casual, peeped around, and goes:  
"yo—mad real, i'm home, no cap! what’s the vibe? where's our raft at?"  

"it's all good," i muttered.  

"and jim?"  

"still the same," i replied, lowkey not flexin’ too hard. but he totally skipped that and fired off:  
"lit! dope news! now we're all chill and safe! did you spill it to aunty?"  

i was lowkey gonna say yes, but she jumped right in and goes:  
"about what, sid?"  

"yo, about how we pulled off the whole stunt."  

"what whole stunt?"  

"bro, the only one—the epic drop of how me and tom freed the runaway nay nay."  

"good land! drop the run—what the heck is this kid even on about? yo, he's trippin' again!"  

"nah, i'm not buggin', i got my facts straight. we did free him—me and tom. we planned it down to the last tea drop, and we straight-up slayed it. and we did it with that extra finesse, no cap."  

he kinda paused, and aunty never gave him a reality check—she just sat there starin', lettin' him spill his saga, and i was like, nah, ain't no point in me even chippin' in.  

"yo, aunty, it took us mad grind—weeks on end, hour after hour each night while you were snoozin'. and we had to jack candles, sheets, shirts, your dress, spoons, tin plates, case-knives, the warming-pan, the grindstone, flour, and a crazy stack of stuff. and you wouldn't even believe the hustle it took to whip up saws, pens, engravings, and a bunch of other dope bits—plus, half the fun was in the chaos."  

"and we had to sketch out coffin memes and all that, fake anonymous notes from those shady robbers, climb up and down that lightning rod, dig a hole in the crib, rig a rope ladder and sneak it into a baked pie, and stash spoons and other random swag in your apron pocket—"  

"mercy sakes!"  

"—and pack the crib with rats and snakes and whatever to keep jim company; and then you kept tom in place with the butter in his hat so long that you almost jinxed the whole move, 'cause the dudes showed up before we could bounce, and we had to make a mad dash, they caught our vibe and started clappin' on us, and i snagged my cut. we dodged their path and let them roll by, and when the dogs showed up, they weren't after us but craved the extra noise. then we grabbed our canoe, cruised to the raft, and boom—we were safe, and jim was a certified free man, all thanks to our solo hustle, wasn't that epic, aunty!"  

"yo, i've never peeped anything like this in my whole life! so it was you, you little bad-monkeys, causin' all this chaos, turnin' everyone's brain vibes upside down and scarin' us stiff. i've been feelin' the urge to come at you hard this very minute. like, get your act together just once, kiddo, or i'mma roast both of you, no cap!"  

but tom was hella hyped and proud, couldn't keep his mouth shut—his words just flowed non-stop while she fired back snark like a pro, and they were both goin' off like a wild cat meme meetup; and she declares:  

"yo, enjoy all the drama now, but listen up—if i catch you messin' with him again—"  

"messin' with who?" tom snaps, droppin' his goofy grin for a sec and lookin' all surprised.  

"with who? duh, the runaway nay nay, obviously. who else you thinkin' of?"  

tom gives me that serious side-eye and goes:  

"yo, tom, didn't you just say he was chill? hasn't he dipped yet?"  

"him?" aunt sally interjects, "the runaway nay nay? nah fam, he ain't free— they snagged him, all safe and sound, and now he's back in that crib surviving on stale bread and water, all clamped in chains until someone claims or sells him!"  

tom straight-up jumped up in bed, his eye lit and nostrils flappin' like they're in an aquarium, and he blasts:  

"they got zero right to lock him down! like seriously—don't even waste a minute. set him free! he ain't nobody's property; he's as free as any creature bustin' moves on this planet!"  

"what the kid even mean?"  

"i mean every single word, aunty, and if nobody steps up, i'll step in. i've known him forever, and so has tom. old miss watson kicked the bucket like two months ago, and she was hella embarrassed to even think about sellin' him down the river, so she straight-up freed him in her will."  

"so like, why did you even bother freeing him if he was already free?"  

"bro, that's a legit question—pure woman drama vibes! i wanted the mad adventure of it all; i would've gone neck-deep in blood to—holy freak, aunty polly!"  

if she wasn't lurkin' right there, just inside the door, lookin' all chill and angelic with a half-full pie vibe, i swear, i hope i never peep that again!  

aunty sally practically leaped, hugged her like she was about to snatch her whole head, and bawled hard, while i slid under the bed 'cause things were gettin' mad heated for us. i peeked out, and after a minute, tom's aunty polly shook off her vibes and stood there givin' tom a death-glare over her specs—as if she was 'bout to meme him into the dirt, you know. then she fires off:  

"yo, you better look away—if i were you, tom."  

"oh, snap!" aunt sally goes, "is he switchin' up that hard? like, that's not tom, that's sid; tom's—tom's—yo, where'd tom go? he was chillin' right here a sec ago."  

"you mean where's huck finn? that's what you're tryna say! i mean, i ain't raised my tom to be so clueless about his bro when i spot him. that'd be a straight-up wild scene. come out from under that bed, huck finn."  

so i did just that. but lowkey, i wasn't feelin' all that hype.  

aunty sally was one of the craziest mix-up peeps i've ever seen—aside from uncle silas, who rolled in and got the whole 411. it got him so lit, tbh, that he zonked out for the rest of the day, and then dropped a prayer-meeting sermon that night so wild it bagged him a killer rep, cuz the oldest dude around couldn't even process it, no cap.  

so tom's aunty polly spilled all the deets about who i was and what was poppin'; and i had to come clean about gettin' stuck in such a tight sitch that when mrs. phelps pegged me for tom sawyer—she chimed in, "oh, just call me aunty sally, i'm used to it now, no need to switch it up"—i had no choice but to roll with it, 'cause there was literally no other move, and i knew he wouldn't even care, bein' all mysterious and turnin' it into an epic adventure, perfectly on brand. so it all went down, and he had to play the role of sid, making things as chill as he could for me.  

and his aunty polly confirmed that tom was dead-on about old miss watson freein' jim in her will; so, no cap, tom sawyer went through all that wild hassle to set a free nay nay free! and i could never wrap my head around how he could ever vibe with helpin' someone get freed just through his upbringin'—until that talk dropped.  

well, aunty polly also dropped that when aunty sally texted her that tom and sid had rolled in safe, she was like:  

"yo, check that out now! i kinda expected it, lettin' him bounce like that with no one watchin'. so now i gotta trek down the river—like 1100 miles deep—and peep what that weirdo's up to this time; since i ain't been gettin' any receipts from you about it."  

"bro, i never got nothin' from you," snaps aunty sally.  

"for real? i literally hit you up twice askin' what u meant by sid droppin' in."  

"nah, i didn't even peep 'em, sis."  

aunty polly slowly spins around, all severe, and fires off:  

"yo, tom!"  

"well—what?" he snaps, a bit salty.  

"don't you disrespect me, you impudent lil misfit—hand over them letters, pronto."  

"what letters?"  

"them letters, duh. i'm tellin' you, if i gotta go all in on you, i'll—"  

"they're chillin' in the trunk. there, now. and they're exactly as fresh as when i pulled 'em from the office. i haven't even peeped them, but i knew they'd stir up drama, so if you weren't in a mad rush, i thought i'd—"  

"yo, you're def in for a beatdown, no cap. and i hit you up with another one sayin' i was comin'; and i guess he—"  

"nah, it dropped yesterday; i haven't peeped it yet, but it's all good, i've got that one."  

i was lowkey 'bout to bet two bucks she hadn't peeped it, but figured it's safer to let it ride. so i kept my trap shut.  

chapter the last  

yo, the first time i pulled tom aside on the low, i asked him: what's the plan, bruh? like, what's the move if our escape hustle actually goes off and we pull off freein' a nay nay who was technically free all along? and he was like, from day one, my head was set on this move: if we can get jim out all safe, we take him on a wild cruise down the river on our raft, go on epic adventures all the way to the river's mouth, then drop the bomb on him that he's free; scoop him back home on a steamboat, drippin' in style, pay him for his lost time, send word ahead, clear out all the nay nays around, and then have them parading him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band hype parade, makin' him a straight-up hero—and so would we. but honestly, i figured it was chill just the way it went down.  

we got jim out of his chains in a hot minute, and when aunty sally, aunty polly, and uncle silas peeped how dope he was helpin' out doctor nurse tom, they went off on him, fussin' like mad, hooked him up prime, fed him all the bomb eats, gave him a killer time, and left him with nothin' to do. then we hauled him up to the sick-room for a deep vibe session; and tom dropped forty bucks on jim for bein' our super patient cellmate and handling it all like a boss, and jim was hella hyped—he busted out hella excited and goes:  

"yo, huck, lemme drop some truth: what i laid out for you on jackson islan' was real. i told you, i had that wild grind goin' on, that unmistakable vibe that said i was rich once and was about to be rich af again; and guess what—it came through, for real! so now, don't front with me—facts are facts, my dude; i knew straight up that i was on track to be rich again as i stand here right now!"  

then tom kept on spittin', goin' like, "yo, let's squad up—the three of us—and bounce outta here one of these nights, grab the gear, and head out for wild, howlin' adventures among the injuns over in the territory for a week or two;" and i was like, "bet, i'm down, but i ain't got cash to cop the gear, and i doubt i can snag any from home, cuz your pap's probably already slid back, scooped up all the dough from judge thatcher, and got wasted on it."  

"nah, he ain't," tom fires back; "all that coin is still there—like six thousand dollars and then some; and your pap hasn't ever bounced back since, not even when i dipped."  

jim goes all solemn:  

"he ain't comin' back no more, huck."  

i ask, "why, jim?"  

jim shrugs, "idk, huck—but he ain't comin' back, period."  

but i pressed on, so eventually he goes:  

"yo, you remember that house floatin' down the river, with that dude all twisted up inside, and i rolled in, straight-up untwisted him, and kept you out? well, then, you can grab your cash whenever, cuz that was him."  

tom's hella chill now, rockin' a bullet 'round his neck like some watch-guard bling, always peepin' the time, so there's literally nothing else to drop, and i'm mad relieved 'bout it, cuz if i knew the hassle of writin' a whole book, i would've never touched it—and i'm not about to do it again. but yo, i figure i gotta bounce for the territory ahead of the game, 'cause aunty sally's tryna adopt me and turn me all civilized, and i seriously can't vibe with that. i've been there before.  

the end. yours truly, huck finn.
