chapter v.

i had slammed the door shut, fr. then i spun around and there he was, just vibing in my rearview like a ghost from old memes. i used to be low-key shook every time—dude used to tan me so hard it was like a sunburned screenshot. i figured i was hella scared again at first, but ngl, in like a minute my heart hit a vibe check and i realized i was straight-up mistaken—i mean, after that first jolt when my breath legit skipped a beat because he popped out so unexpected; but then, real quick, i was like, nah, not scared enough to even bother.

he was pushing fifty, and no cap, he looked it. his hair was long, tangled af, and greasy like a busted fryer, just hanging down while his eyes glowed behind that vine-like mess. it was all deep black—zero gray vibes; same with his wild, mixed-up whiskers. his face, where it showed, was bone-white—like not your average dude white but the kind that makes your skin do a revulsion meme, a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white that’s legit cringe. and his outfit? straight-up rags, no drip at all. he had one ankle chillin’ on his other knee, and the boot on that foot was busted so badly two toes were peeking out and doing their own clout chase. his hat was just sprawled on the floor—a worn-out black slouch cap with the top all caved in, like a failed lid drop.

i was just staring at him, and he was also sitting there, sizing me up from his chair that was tilted back ever so slightly. i dropped the candle like it was hot. i peeped that the window was ajar—so he obviously climbed in through the shed. he kept eyeballing me all over. pretty soon, he goes:

“starchy threads—facts. you think you’re a major big-bug, huh?”

“maybe i am, maybe i ain’t,” i shot back, no cap.

“don’t give me any lip, bruh,” he snaps. “you’ve been stacking on those extra frills since i dipped. i’m gonna drag you down a peg before i’m done with you. they say you’re educated now—read and write and all that noise. you think you’re better than your pops ‘cause he can’t even hit the books? i’m gonna wipe that swag off your profile. who even told you it was cool to mess with all that highfalutin foolishness, eh? who gave you permission?”

“the widow. she clued me in.”

“the widow, huh? and who told her she could shove her shovel into business that ain’t even hers?”

“nobody ever said shit to her.”

“alright then, imma school her on meddling. and listen up—you drop that school hustle, you feel me? i’ll teach folks to raise a boy so he can flex airs over his own pops and act like he’s all that. if i catch you clowning around at that school again, imma come at you. your mama couldn’t read or write, period, before she dipped—and none of the fam could even back in the day. i can’t stand this hype, and here you are blowing up like you’re the next gen influencer. i ain’t having it—so spit some words, let me hear you read.”

i grabbed a book and started spitting some lines about general washington and all the war drama. after like, half a minute of me reading, he straight-up smacked the book with his hand, sending it flying across the crib. he goes:

“facts. you got this, i had my doubts when you first flexed. now listen up—drop those extra frills. i won’t have it. i’m gonna smack you down, my smarty pants; and if i catch you hitting that school again, imma tan you proper. first off, you’re gonna get a dose of religion too. i ain’t ever seen a son like you.”

next, he snatches up this tiny blue-and-yellow pic of some cows and a kid and goes:

“what’s this?”

“it’s like a badge they hand me for nailing my lessons.”

he rips it up and goes:

“i’ll hook you up with something better—imma give you a cowhide.”

he then sits there mumbling and growling for a hot minute, and then he goes:

“ain’t you one sweet-scented dandy, though? a bed, fresh sheets, a mirror, and a dope carpet—while your own pops is out there crashing with the hogs in the tanyard. i ain’t ever seen a son like you. i bet i’ll strip away all these extra airs before i’m done with you. no cap, your flex is endless—they say you’re rich. huh? what’s the tea?”

“they lie—that’s facts.”

“listen here—watch your mouth when you talk to me; i’m already maxed out today—so don’t come with that sass. i’ve been in town two days straight and all anyone’s buzzing about is you bein’ rich. i even heard that drip down the river. that’s why i’m here. you slide me that cash by tomorrow—I want it.”

“i ain’t got no money.”

“that’s cap. judge thatcher’s stackin’ it. hand it over. i need it.”

“i told you, i ain’t got no money. ask judge thatcher; he’ll spill it.”

“aight. i’ll hit him up; and i’ll squeeze him for every penny, or find out why his pockets are so deep. so, how much you packin’ in your pocket? i’m talkin’ now.”

“i only got a dollar, and i was gonna keep it—”

“doesn’t matter what you want it for—just cough it up.”

he snatched that dollar and chomped it to check if it was legit, then announced he was bouncing downtown to grab some whisky; said he hadn’t sipped any booze all day. once he bounced out to the shed, he popped his head back in and started cussing me out for flexing those extra airs and trying to be all superior; and when i figured he dipped, he rolled back in to warn me: watch that school hustle, ‘cause if i don’t drop it, imma come at you and smack you hard.

the next day, pap was smashed and stormed over to judge thatcher’s, full-on bully mode, trying to strong-arm him into handing over the cash; but judge thatcher wasn’t having it, so pap swore he’d flex the law’s muscle to make him cave.

then the judge and the widow took it to court, trying to snatch me away and make one of them my guardian; but it was a fresh new judge who didn’t vibe with the old man, and he was like, courts ain’t supposed to mess with family bonds if they can help it—he’d rather not yank a kid from his pops. so judge thatcher and the widow had to bounce on that whole plan.

that totally lit the old man up. he vowed he’d cowhide me so hard i’d be black and blue if i didn’t hustle up some cash for him. i snagged three bucks from judge thatcher, and pap grabbed it, got super smashed, and went on a wild rampage—cursing, rampaging, and whooping folks all around town with a tin pan until nearly midnight—then they locked him up, and the next day he got court-bound again and was jailed for a week. but pap was all satisfied, declaring he was the boss of his son and would make sure i paid for it.

when pap got out, the new judge was like, i’m gonna mold you into a real man. so he hauled you back to his crib, dressed you up all clean and sharp, and had you chow down breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the fam—treating you like old pie, so to speak. and after supper, he got deep about temperance and all that life advice until pap busted out crying, admitting he’d been a fool wasting his life; but now he was ready to flip the script, become a man no one would diss, and prayed the judge would have his back without throwing shade. the judge was like, “hug all the feels for that,” so pap cried, and his wife cried along with him; pap then claimed he’d always been misunderstood, and the judge was like, “i feel you, man.” pap went on to say that what a real man craves is mad sympathy, and the judge agreed—so they both got tearful again. then, at bedtime, pap stood up, stretched out his hand, and proclaimed:

“check it out, my dudes and dudettes; grab my hand and shake it. this used to be a hog’s hand—messy and raw—but not anymore; it’s the hand of a man who’s rebooted his life and would die before sliding back to that old self. remember my words—don’t forget i dropped them. it’s a clean hand now; shake it up—don’t be scared.”

so they shook it around, one by one, crying it up. the judge’s wife even planted a kiss on his hand. then pap signed his pledge—dropped his mark. the judge declared it the holiest moment ever, something epic like that. next, they tucked pap into a gorgeous spare room, and later in the night he got mega thirsty, clambered onto the porch roof, slid down a stanchion like a daredevil, swapped his fresh new coat for a jug of forty-rod, climbed back up, and partied hard; and by daylight, he crawled out again, trashed as a fiddler, tumbled off the porch, busted his left arm in two spots, and ended up frozen to death when someone found him after sunrise. and whenever anyone tried to map out that spare room later, they had to take mad measurements just to navigate it.

the judge was low-key feeling the pain. he mumbled that maybe a shotgun could reform pap, but honestly, he had no other lit ideas.
