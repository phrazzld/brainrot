chapter x.

after breakfast, i was all like, "yo, let’s chat about that dead dude and figure out who offed him," but jim wasn’t having any of it. he claimed it’d bring bad juju; plus, he warned that unburied dudes were way more likely to come back and haunt us than be chillin’ in the grave. that sounded kinda legit, so i kept quiet—though i couldn’t help obsessing over who shot the guy and why.

we rifled through the clothes we’d snagged and found eight bucks in silver sewn into the lining of an old blanket overcoat. jim was like, "i bet the peeps in that house jack-pocked the coat, 'cause if they knew about the cash, they wouldn’t have left it." i was like, "facts, i reckon they offed him too," but jim wasn’t down to chat about that. so i threw down:

"yo, you say it’s bad luck, but remember when i grabbed that snake-skin from the ridge the day before yesterday? you were all like, 'touching a snake-skin is the worst bad luck ever.' well, here’s your jinx! we just raked in all this loot plus eight bucks. i wish we could pull a run of this crazy luck every day, jim."

jim fired back, "nah, babe, chill—don’t get too extra. trust, it’s on its way. i promise, it’s coming."

and it did come, no cap. that talk all went down on a tuesday. then, after dinner on friday, we were just laid out in the grass at the top of the ridge, completely done with tobacco. i bounced over to the cavern to grab some more and bumped into a rattlesnake. i took it out and casually curled its body up at the foot of jim’s blanket, thinking it’d be a hilarious surprise when jim found it. but by nighttime, i totally forgot about the snake—until jim flopped onto the blanket right as i lit a light and the snake’s partner appeared and bit him.

jim jumped up screaming, and the very first thing the light caught was that snake buddy all curled up and ready to strike again. i clapped it down in a sec with a stick, and then jim snatched pap’s whisky-jug and started pouring that liquid gold like some next-level remedy.

jim was barefoot, and the snake bit him right on the heel. all that went down ‘cause i was such a dingus for forgetting that whenever you ditch a dead snake, its partner always shows up to cling. jim ordered me to hack off the snake’s head and toss it, then skin the body and roast a piece of it. i did it, and he scarfed it down while swearing it’d cure him. he even had me pull off the snake’s rattles and tie ‘em around his wrist, saying that would work too. then i dipped out low-key and chucked the snake remains deep into the bushes, ‘cause i sure as heck wasn’t about to let jim know it was all on me.

jim kept guzzling from the jug, tripping and yelling every now and then, but every time he snapped back he was right back at the jug. his foot swelled up huge, and so did his leg; but eventually the booze kicked in, so i figured he’d be aight—even though, honestly, i’d rather get bit by a snake than guzzle pap’s whisky.

jim was out of commission for four whole days and nights. once the swelling cleared and he was back on his feet, i vowed never to handle snake-skins with my bare hands again, now that i’d seen the epic fail they can cause. jim said he knew i’d learn my lesson and warned that handling a snake-skin was jinx-level bad luck—maybe our saga wasn’t over yet. he swore he’d rather catch the new moon over his left shoulder a thousand times than ever touch a snake-skin again. honestly, i was starting to feel that vibe myself, even though i’ve always thought gawking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the dumbest, most reckless moves ever. like old hank bunker did it once, bragged hard about it, then got so smashed within two years he fell off the shot-tower and ended up all sprawled out like a human pancake—and they had to shuffle him sideways between two barn doors for a coffin before burying him (or so pap told me). all that for checking out the moon like a total fool.

so the days rolled on and the river dipped back down between its banks again. one of our very first moves was to bait a huge hook with a skinned rabbit and set it up, landing a catfish as big as a dude—6 foot 2 inches long and over 200 pounds. we couldn’t even handle that beast; he would’ve launched us straight into illinois. we just watched him thrashing around until he drowned. we even found a brass button in his stomach, a round ball, and a bunch of random junk. we split the ball open with our hatchet and found a spool inside. jim said he’d been stashing it there for ages, coating it over to form a ball. no cap, that was probably the biggest fish ever caught in the mississippi. jim swore he’d never seen a bigger one, and in the village, that catch would’ve been worth mad cash. they flog fish like that by the pound at the market—everyone’s all over it, and his meat was as white as snow, perfect for frying up.

the next morning, i was like, "this scene is getting slow and dull; we need to stir things up." so i figured i’d slip across the river to scope out what’s poppin’. jim dug the plan but insisted i had to roll out in the dark and be on point. then he was like, "yo, why not slap on some of that old gear and disguise yourself as a girl?" which was a dope idea too. so we hacked one of the calico gowns into a shorter version, i flipped my trouser legs up to my knees, and suited up. jim hitched it in place with some hooks, and it actually fit pretty well. i rocked the sun-bonnet tied under my chin, and anyone who glanced at my face would see something that looked like staring down a long joint of stove-pipe. jim claimed no one would recognize me, even in broad daylight. i practiced all day to nail the act, and eventually got the hang of it—only jim kept roasting me for not strutting like a proper girl and for constantly tugging up my gown to check my britches-pocket. i took his advice and leveled up.

i set off along the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.

i then paddled across to town from a spot a little below the ferry landing, and the current drift dropped me right at the bottom of town. i tied up and crept along the bank. there was a light burning in a rundown shanty that looked abandoned forever, and i couldn’t help but wonder who was bunking there. i snuck up and peeped in through the window. inside, a woman in her forties was busy knitting by candlelight on a pine table. i didn’t recognize her face at all—she was a total stranger, and in that town, everybody’s face was already known to someone. luckily, i was feeling pretty off—afraid that if i stayed too long, someone might catch my voice and clue me in. but if this woman had been in such a tiny town for two days, she’d know all the tea. so i knocked on the door, firmly deciding to stick to the girl act.
