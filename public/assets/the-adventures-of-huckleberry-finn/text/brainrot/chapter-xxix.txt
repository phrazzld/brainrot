chapter xxix.

so they rolled up a super fly old gentleman and a sharp young buck, rockin' a sling on his right arm. fr, the crowd was going off with yells and laughs non-stop. but i wasn’t catching any meme vibe from it, and i figured it’d stress out the duke and king if they actually peeped the joke. i figured they'd turn ghost-white. but nah, not a soul did. the duke played it cool, actin' all clueless, just vibin' for clout like a jug that's straight spillin' buttermilk; and as for the king, he just kept starin' all sorrowed at the new peeps, like it twisted his insides thinkin' such scammy frauds and rascals could exist. damn, he was on point. mad heads gathered around him, lettin' him know they were his ride-or-die crew. that old gent who just dropped in looked hella confuzzled. pretty soon, he started droppin' lines, and i peeped he was channelin' straight english vibes—not exactly king style, tho the king’s own tryin' was pretty decent for an imitation. i can’t drop his exact words, but he flipped to the crowd and went something like:

"yo, this is a total plot twist i did not expect; gotta be straight-up real here, i'm not fully dialed in to handle this tea right now; me and my bro have been hit with major bad juju—he busted his arm, and our swag got left behind in some mix-up town last night. i'm peter wilks' bro harvey, and this here's his bro william, who basically can't hear or speak—and like, can barely sign, cuz he's rockin' just one hand. we’re legit who we say we are; in like one or two days, when i snag our baggage, i can show the receipts. but til then, imma bounce to the hotel and chill."

so that dude and the new dummy bounced; and the king cracked up, spittin' his crazy banter:

"busted his arm—lowkey, right?—mad convenient for a fraudster who’s gotta whip out signs but never got schooled on it. dropped their baggage! that's hella dope!—and super ingenious on the situ, facts!"

so he bust out laughing again; and honestly, everyone else was laughing too, 'cept like three or four, or maybe half a dozen. one of 'em was that doc; another was this sharp dude rockin' an old-school carpet-bag fresh off the steamboat, low-key whisperin' to him and peepin' the king now and then—yup, it was levi bell, the lawyer who bailed up to louisville; and another was a big, burly dude who rolled in and soaked up every word the old gent dropped, also tunin' in to the king. then, when the king wrapped up, this burly dude stepped up and went:

"yo, listen up; if you are harvey wilks, when’d you roll into this town?"

"the day before the funeral, bro," replies the king.

"but like, what time of day?"

"in the evenin'—like, about an hour or two pre-sunset."

"how'd you even roll in?"

"i came down on the susan powell from cincinnati."

"so then, how'd you end up at the pint in the mornin'—in a canoe?"

"i wasn’t even at the pint in the mornin'."

"that's cap."

a bunch of 'em jumped on him, beggin' him not to talk that smack to an old dude and a preacher.

"preacher, damn, dude's a fraud and a liar. he was legit at the pint that mornin'. i live up there, right? so listen, i was there too, and he was there. i saw him, no doubt. he rocked up in a canoe, with tim collins and some kid."

then the doc piped up:

"yo, hines, would you peep the boy if you saw him again?"

he straight-up pointed at me. then the doc went:

"neighbors, i ain't sure if this new duo is scammin' or not; but if these two ain't frauds, then i'm straight-up an idiot, period. i think we gotta lock 'em down until we get the full tea. come on, hines; all of y'all, roll up. we're gonna haul these dudes to the tavern, confront 'em with the other crew, and i bet we'll uncover some truths before long."

it was total chaos for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s peeps; so we all bounced. it was about sundown. the doc grabbed my hand, all kind and careful, but he never let go.

we all crashed into this massive hotel room, lit some candles, and hauled in the new duo. first, the doc went:

"i don't wanna harsh on these dudes too much, but i lowkey think they're scammin' and might've got sidekicks we ain't clued in on. and yo, if they do, won't those accomplices just dip with that bag of gold peter wilks left behind? for real. and if these guys are legit, they won't mind callin' up for that cash and lettin' us hold onto it until they prove the receipts—facts, right?"

everyone was down with that. so i figured our crew was officially in a tight jam from the jump. but the king just wore a sorrowful face and went:

"yo, gents, i wish the money was there, cuz i ain't feelin' about droppin' any coin for a full-on, transparent investigation on this whack biz; but, dude, the money's ghost; go on, check if you want."

"so, where's that cash at then?"

"well, here's the tea: when my niece handed me the bag to hold for her, i stashed it in the straw tick of my bed, not wantin' to bank it for the few days we were chillin' here, and i figured the bed was a safe zone, since we're not really used to nay nay, and supposin' 'em honest like english servants. but lowkey, the nay nay jacked it the very next mornin' right after i hit the stairs; and when i sold 'em, i hadn't even peeped the money, so they dipped with it clean. my servant here can drop the deets, gents."

the doc and a bunch were like "shucks!" and i could tell no one was dissin' him. one dude asked me if i witnessed the nay nay jack it. i was like, "nah, but i peeped 'em sneakin' out on the low, hustlin' away, and i didn't give it much thought—figured they were scared they woke my boss and were bouncin' before he snapped." that was all they were trippin' about. then the doc spun on me and said:

"you english too, or what?"

i was like, "yes," and he and a few others cracked up, droppin' a "stuff!"

well, then they dove headfirst into this mad investigation, goin' up and down hour after hour, and not a soul even mentioned supper—it was totally off the radar—and so they kept pushin' it, non-stop; it was the wildest, most jumbled mess ever. they made the king drop his yarn, and forced the old gent to spill his too; and honestly, only a bunch of snobby, biased clowns would miss that the old gent was droppin' straight truth while the other was full of cap. before long, they hauled me up to spill what i knew. the king shot me a shady left-handed glance, so i knew it was cool to drop the real tea. i started rapping about sheffield, how we were livin' our best there, and the lowdown on the english wilkses and all that; but i didn't really get goin' until the doc busted out laughing; and then levi bell, that lawyer, said:

"set down, my boy; wouldn't wanna strain myself if i were you. i reckon you ain't used to lying—it's not your jam; what you need is some serious practice. you're doin' it mad awkward."

i wasn't even trippin' about the props, but lowkey, i was stoked to get off that heat.

the doc was about to drop more, then spun and said:

"if you had been in town from the jump, levi bell—"

the king cut in, reachin' out his hand and goin':

"yo, is this my late bro's old homie he used to hype up so much?"

the lawyer and the king shook hands, and the lawyer grinned all smug while they chatted for a bit, then slid aside to whisper; finally, the lawyer spoke up and said:

"that’s gonna settle it. imma take the order and send it, along with your bro's, and then everyone will know it's straight-up legit."

so they grabbed some paper and a pen, and the king leaned his head to one side, chewed his tongue, and scribbled down some deets; then they passed the pen to the duke—and for real, the duke looked hella off—but he grabbed the pen and jotted something. then the lawyer turned to the new old gent and said:

"yo, you and your bro, drop a line or two and sign your names, aight?"

the old gent scribbled his part, but honestly, no one could read his dribble. the lawyer looked mega shook and said:

"well, it beats me"—and he pulled a bunch of old letters from his pocket, eyeballed 'em, then checked the old gent’s scribbles, and back to the letters; then he went on, "these vintage letters are from harvey wilks; and peep these two different handwritings—any sober person can tell these weren't penned by him" (i swear, the king and the duke looked straight sold and clownish seein' how the lawyer had 'em), "and check out this old gent’s scrawl—anyone can tell he didn't even write it proper. now, here's some letters from—"

the new old gent cut in, "if you don't mind, lemme break it down. only my bro can read my scribbles—so he copies for me. what you’re lookin' at is his hand, not mine."

"well!" said the lawyer, "this is wild. i got some of william’s letters too; so if you can get him to drop a line or two so we can com—"

"he can't write with his left hand," the old gent interjected. "if he could rock his right, you'd see he penned his own letters and mine as well. peep both—they're by the same hand, no cap."

the lawyer wrapped it up and said, "i believe that's the move—and if not, there's a hella stronger vibe than i noticed anyway. well, well, well! i thought we were on track for a fix, but it's kinda gone haywire, tbh. but yo, one thing's clear: these two ain't even either of the wilkses," he waved his head toward the king and the duke.

yo, what do y'all think? that muleheaded old fool wasn't gonna cave then! indeed, he wouldn't. he claimed it wasn't a fair test, sayin' his bro william was the ultimate prankster who never even tried writin'—like, william was plannin' one of his jokes the moment he grabbed a pen. so he warmed up and kept ramblin' until he nearly believed his own cap; but then the new gent jumped in and said:

"i've got a thought. is there anybody here who helped set out my bro—helped lay out the late peter wilks for his buryin'?"

"yeah," piped up somebody, "me and ab turner did it. we were both down."

then the old gent flipped toward the king and said:

"yo, maybe this dude can drop what was inked on his chest, aight?"

both of 'em replied, "we ain't peeped any mark at all."

"good!" declared the old gent. "now, what you did peep on his chest was a small, faded p, and a b (like his dropped initial from his younger days), and a w, with dashes between 'em—so: p—b—w"—and he scribbled that on a scrap. "c'mon, ain't that what you saw?"

both of 'em spoke up again, sayin', "no, we didn't. we never peeped any marks whatsoever."

well, now everyone was straight-up flipped, and they started chantin':

"the whole bilin’ of ’m ’s frauds! le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail!"

and the mob was whoopin' at once, a full-on rattlin' powwow. but then the lawyer jumped on a table and yelled:

"gentlemen—gentlemen! hear me out for a sec—just one word—if you please! there's one last move—let's go unearth the corpse and peep it up."

that got 'em hyped.

"hooray!" they all shouted, and started bouncin' off; but the lawyer and the doc quickly hollered:

"hold up, hold up! grab these four dudes and the boy, and round 'em up too!"

"we gotchu!" they all chanted; "and if we don't peep those marks, we're gonna lynch the whole crew!"

i was shook, ngl. but there was zero way out. they grabbed all of us and marched us straight down to the graveyard, like, a mile and a half down the river, with the whole town chasin' us, cuz we were makin' mad noise and it was just nine in the evenin'.

as we passed our crib, i was lowkey wishin' i hadn't sent mary jane outta town; cuz if i could've flicked her a wink, she'd have bounced and saved me, and clapped back at our dead-beats.

so, we swarmed down the river road, like wildcats on the prowl; and to make it even creepier, the sky was darkenin' up hard, lightning flashing in quick strobe, and the wind shiverin' through the leaves. this was the absolute worst, most dangerous jam i ever got into; i was legit stunned—everything was goin' so different from what i planned. instead of chillin' and takin' my time to enjoy the vibes, with mary jane ready to bail me out at a moment's notice, here i was facin' sudden death over some tattoo marks. if they didn't find those—

i couldn't even bear to think about it, but for real, i couldn't peep anything else. it only got darker and darker—a perfect time to ghost the mob—but that big husky had me by the wrist, hines, and i was as screwed as tryin' to ditch goliar. he dragged me along, so hyped and excited, that i had to sprint just to keep up.

when they rolled up, they swarmed into the graveyard like an overflow. when they hit the grave, they found they had, like, a hundred shovels, but nobody even thought to grab a lantern. still, they dived into diggin' by the flicker of lightning, and even sent someone to the nearest crib, half a mile off, to borrow one.

so they dug and dug like non-stop; it got mad dark, the rain kicked in, the wind swished heavy, lightning flashed faster and faster, and the thunder boomed like crazy; but those folks were so deep in the biz, they didn't even care—one minute you could see every face in that massive crowd and shovels of dirt flyin' out of the grave, and the next, the darkness clapped everything off so hard you couldn't peep a thing.

finally, they hauled out the coffin and started unscrewin' the lid, and then there was a wild rush of folks bumpin' and shovin', all tryin' to snag a look—it was straight-up awful in the dark. hines hurt my wrist real bad, pullin' and tuggin' so hard he almost forgot i was there, so hyped and pantin'.

suddenly, lightning dropped a perfect burst of white glare, and somebody shouted out:

by the living jingo, yo, peep that bag of gold chillin’ on his chest!

hines busted out a wild whoop, just like the whole squad, and whipped his wrist to bust his way in for a peek, while i dipped out slick in that pitch-black night – legit, no one was clockin’ my speed.

i had the road all to myself, and i was straight-up flying—like, it was all mine except for the heavy dark vibes, random glare stares, rain buzzin’ like it’s on overdrive, wind slap-happy, and thunder splitin’ the sky; no cap, i was cruisin’ like a total boss!

when i rolled into town, i peeped that nobody was out in the storm, so i didn’t waste time peepin’ any back alleys – i just humped it down the main drag; and as i got close to our crib, i scoped it out. no lights at all; the house was mad dark—which had me feelin’ some type of way, lowkey bummed out though i couldn’t put my finger on it. but then, as i was sailin’ by, bam! a flash lit up mary jane’s window, and my heart legit almost exploded; in that instant the whole house was left in the dark, ghosted for good in this world. she was the dopest babe i’d ever peeped, straight-up loaded with that extra beach vibe.

the minute i was high enough above town to see a spot for the tow-head, i started scannin’ for a boat to jack, and the first time lightning lit up a ride that wasn’t chained, i snatched it and yeeted out. it was a canoe, no cap, barely tethered with just a rope. the tow-head sat hella far out in the middle of the river, but i wasn’t about to waste a sec; and when i finally hit the raft, i was so wrecked i nearly just crashed on the spot if i could’ve taken a nap. but nah, as soon as i sprung aboard, i busted out a shout:

“out with you, jim, and set her loose! glory be to goodness, we’re done with them!”

jim dipped out and came barreling after me with his arms spread wide, super hyped; but when i caught a glimpse of him in that lightning flash, my heart did a mega flip and i flipped overboard backwards – 'cause i totally spaced that he was like a mashup of old king lear and a drowned a-rab rolled into one, and that straight-up freaked the bejesus out of me. still, jim fished me out and was about to give me a giant hug and bless me up, so stoked he was that i was back and we were clear of the king and the duke, but i was like:

“not now; treat it like your breakfast, your morning grub! let her go and slide!”

so in like two seconds, we were slidin’ down the river, and it felt so sick to be free again, just us on the big river with zero clout interference. i couldn’t help but bounce around a bit, jump up and flex my heels a few times—but on the third snap, i caught a sound i knew all too well, so i held my breath and listened; and yup, when the next flash broke over the water, there they were—already settin’ up with their oars and making their skiff hum. yeah, it was the king and the duke.

i ended up slumping hard onto the planks, feelin’ so done, barely holdin’ back the tears.
