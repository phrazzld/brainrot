chapter xxx.

when they got aboard, the king came straight at me, shook my collar, and was like, “you trying to dip on us, huh, you little pup? tired of our squad, yo?”

i was like, “nah, your majesty, i wasn’t—please chill, your majesty!”

“quick, then, spill your plan, or imma shake your guts out!”

“honestly, i’ll tell you everything exactly as it went down, your majesty. the dude who had me on hold was super chill to me, always goin’ on about havin’ a boy as big as me who died last year, and he felt bad seein’ a kid in such a wild mess; and when everyone got totally caught off guard by that gold drop and rushed for the coffin, he dropped me and whispered, ‘hurry it up, or they’ll hang you for sure!’ so i dipped. staying just wasn’t an option—i couldn’t do a thing, and i wasn’t tryna get hung if i could bounce. so i kept on runnin’ until i snagged that canoe; and when i landed here, i told jim to hustle, or they’d catch and hang me, and i said i was scared you and the duke were already toast, which made me hella sorry, and jim was feelin’ it too, and he was super glad when we peeped you comin’; you can ask jim if you need the deets.”

jim confirmed that, and the king told him to zip it, sayin’, “oh hell yea, it's hella likely!” while shakin’ me up again, claimin’ he could’ve drowned me. but then the duke jumped in:

“leggo the boy, you old idiot! would you have done any different? did you even search for him when you got loose? i don’t remember that.”

so the king dropped me and started goin’ off on that town and everyone in it. then the duke fired back:

“yo, you better be dissin’ yourself real hard, since you deserve it the most. you haven't done a single smart move from the jump except comin’ out all cool and cheeky with that fake blue-arrow mark. that move was fire—it was straight-up bully; and it saved our butts. ’cause if it weren’t for that, they'd have locked us up until those englishmen's baggage dropped in—and then, penitentiary, no lie! but that trick took 'em straight to the graveyard, and that gold did us a major solid; 'cause if those hyped-up fools hadn't dropped all caution and rushed for a peek, we'd have been rockin’ our cravats tonight—legit cravats worth flexin’—longer than needed!”

they chilled for a minute, mullin’ it over; then the king, all zoned-out, goes, “mf! and we reckoned the nay nays stole it!”

that totally made me squirm!

“yeah,” says the duke, all slow and dripping with sarcasm, “we did.”

after about half a minute, the king drawled, “leastways, i did.”

the duke snapped back, same vibe, “on the contrary, i did.”

the king got all ruffled and says, “looky here, bilgewater, what are you referrin’ to?”

the duke snaps, “when it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what were you referrin’ to?”

“shucks!” says the king, oozing sarcasm, “but i dunno—maybe you were sleepin’ and had no idea what was up.”

the duke bristled, “oh, cut out this cursed nonsense; do you take me for a complete fool? don't you think i know who hid that money in that coffin?”

“yes, sir! i know you do know, because you done it yourself!”

“it’s a lie!”—and the duke charged. the king hollered, “take your hands off! let go of my throat! i take it all back!”

the duke fired, “well, you just own up first—that you did hide that money there, plannin’ to dip one day and slide back to scoop it all for yourself.”

“wait just a minute, duke—answer this one question, honest and fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and i'll believe you and take back everything i said.”

“you old scoundrel, i didn't, and you know i didn't. there, now!”

“well, then, i believe you. but answer me just this one more—now don't get mad; didn't you have it in your mind to grab the money and hide it?”

the duke stayed silent a bit; then he goes, “well, i don't care if i did, i didn't do it, anyway. but you not only had it in mind to do it, you did it.”

“i wish i never died if i did that, duke, and that's straight-up truth. i won't say i wasn't gonna do it, 'cause i was; but you—i mean somebody—got there before me.”

“it's a lie! you did it, and you gotta own up, or—”

the king started gurgling, then gasped, “enough! i own up!”

i was super relieved to hear him come clean; it got me way more chill than before. so the duke dropped his grip and said:

“if you ever deny it again, i'll drown you. it's totally on you to sit there and cry like a baby—it fits you, considering how you've acted. i never saw such an old dinosaur for wanting to snatch up everything—and i was trusting you like you were my own dad. you should be ashamed to let that fall on a bunch of poor nay nays without saying a word for 'em. it's ridiculous to think i was soft enough to buy that trash. damn, i can now see why you were so eager to fix the deficit—you wanted to scoop up all the money from the nonesuch and bag it for yourself, one way or another!”

the king, all timid and sniffling, said, “why, duke, it was you that said to make up the deficit; it wasn’t me.”

“dry up! i don't want to hear any more out of you!” says the duke. “and now look at what you got out of it. they've gotten all their money back, and all we got is a shekel or two extra. go to bed, and don't you ever hit me with any more deficits for as long as you live!”

so the king slipped into the wigwam and hit the bottle for comfort, and before long the duke did the same; within about half an hour, they were as thick as thieves again, gettin’ tight and lovin’ it, and ended up snorin’ in each other’s arms. they both got super mellow, but i noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget about denying he hid that money-bag again. that made me feel way more at ease and satisfied. of course, once they were snoozin’, we had a long gab session and i told jim everything.
