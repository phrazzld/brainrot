chapter iii.

so, i got straight roasted in the morning by old miss watson ‘cause my gear was a total mess; but the widow wasn’t savage—she just wiped off the grease and clay and looked all pity-mode, making me think, “aight, maybe i should try to behave for a bit.” then miss watson hauled me into the closet for a prayer sesh, but spoiler alert: it was a total flop. she kept preaching that if i prayed every day, i’d get whatever i wished for. but nah, it didn’t work. i tried—once i even scored a fish-line, but no hooks. like, a fish-line without hooks is whack. i gave hooking a go three or four times, and still, nada. eventually, i begged miss watson to pray for me, but she clapped back, calling me a fool. she never dropped the deets on why, and i was left straight-up confused.

one day, i chilled in the woods and went deep on the prayer hype. i was like, if people can score anything by prayin’, why ain’t deacon winn cashed back the money he lost on pork? why can’t the widow snag her silver snuffbox that got jacked? why can’t miss watson level up? nah, i told myself, there ain’t no juice in it. so i bounced over to the widow and spilled my thoughts, and she was like, “the only score you get from prayin’ is in spiritual gifts.” that was too extra for me, but she broke it down: i gotta come through for others, do everything for them, have their backs 24/7, and never flex on myself—even miss watson’s included, if you catch my drift.

i cruised out in the woods, mulling over it for a hot minute, but couldn’t peep any real profit for me—except maybe for the squad, so i decided to just let it slide. sometimes the widow would pull me aside and drop some providence talk that made my mouth water, but next day, miss watson would swoop in and smack it all down. i figured there were two types of providence—one that vibed with the widow, and one that missed big time with miss watson. after long thinkin’, i figured i’d ride with the widow’s vibe if someone wanted me, even if i couldn’t peep how that would upgrade my life, seeing as i was pretty clueless, low-key extra, and ornery as hell.

pap hadn’t been spotted for over a year, and honestly, that was peak coziness for me—i was so over his drama. he used to always wreck me when he was sober and in the mood to beat me down; so i’d bounce to the woods whenever he was around. then, low-key, word got around that he was found drowned in the river about twelve miles upstream, or so they said. everyone figured it was him—this drowned dude was his size, ragged as heck, and had this wild flow of long hair just like pap; but they couldn’t make out his mug ‘cause it was all waterlogged and blurry. they even said he was floatin’ on his back. so they scooped him up and buried him on the bank. but i wasn’t chill for long, ‘cause i had a brainwave: i knew darn well a drowned man floats face-down, not on his back. so i peeped that this wasn’t pap at all, but a woman rockin’ a dude’s fit. and that had me all kinds of uncomfortable. i figured the old man might bounce back eventually, though low-key, i wished he wouldn’t.

we played robber for like a month, then i bailed—and the whole crew dipped too. we never actually offed anyone; it was all just epic pretend play. we’d bolt out the woods, crashing down on hog-drivers and women in carts lugging garden loot to market, but we never actually snagged any cash. tom sawyer had the wildest nicknames—callin’ hogs “ingots” and turnips “julery”—and we’d retreat to our cave to powwow about our fake heists and how many peeps we “killed and marked.” but i just couldn’t peep any real profit in it. one time, tom sent a boy to blitz around town with a blazing stick he dubbed a “slogan” (our gang’s hype sign), then dropped secret intel from his spies that the next day a whole squad of spanish merchants and rich a-rabs was gonna camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded with di’monds, plus a guard of four hundred soldiers—so we’d ambush them, off the hook, and scoop the loot. he said we had to flex our swords and guns and be mad prepped. i mean, tom could never even hit a turnip-cart but insisted on having all the swords and guns polished, even though they were just lame lath and broomsticks—you could whack ‘em till you dropped, and they’d still be garbage. i wasn’t tryna believe we could take on a mob of spaniards and a-rabs, but i low-key was hyped to peep the camels and elephants, so i rolled up the next day, saturday, ready for the ambush; and when the word dropped, we scrambled outta the woods and blitzed down the hill. plot twist: there were no spaniards, no a-rabs, no camels, not even a trace of elephants. it was nothing but a sunday-school picnic—just a primer-class sesh. we went off, chasing the kiddos up the hollow; and all we ended up snagging were some doughnuts and jam, though ben rogers scored a rag doll and jo harper grabbed a hymn-book and a tract; until the teacher stormed in and made us drop everything and cut.

i didn’t peep any di’monds, so i clapped back to tom sawyer. he was like, “nah dude, there’s loads of ’em there, plus a-rabs, elephants, and all sorts of extras.” i asked, “then why can’t we spot ‘em?” and tom said, “if you weren’t so clueless and had read don quixote, you’d know—it’s all done by enchantment.” he went on, “there’s hundreds of soldiers, elephants, treasure, and more—but our enemies, aka magicians, turned the whole setup into an infant sunday-school hangout outta pure spite.” i was like, “aight, so our move is to go after the magicians?” and tom called me a numskull.

“why,” he declared, “can a magician summon a squad of genies that’d wreck you before you can say jack robinson? these genies are as tall as dank oaks and as wide as churches.”

“so,” i replied, “suppose we score some genies to help us—can’t we then demolish that other mob?”

“how you even gonna get them?” tom shot back.

“i dunno, how do they get ‘em?”

“bro, you just rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and boom—the genies tear in with thunder, lightning, smoke rollin’, and they execute whatever you say. they’d even yank a shot-tower right out by its roots and slam a sunday-school superintendent over the noggin, no cap.”

“who makes ‘em go wild like that?”

“it’s whoever rubs the lamp or ring—they’re locked to whoever does, and they gotta do whatever he says. if you tell ‘em to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds and fill it with chewing-gum, or snag an emperor’s daughter from china for you to marry, they gotta pull it off before sunrise. and get this—they even gotta waltz that palace around the country wherever you want, feel me?”

“well,” i mused, “sounds like they’re a bunch of flat-heads for not guarding that palace themselves instead of letting it get hustled away. and honestly, if i were one of them, i’d peep a dude in jericho before i dropped my hustle for a tin lamp rub.”

“how you talk, huck finn. you’d have to show up when the lamp’s rubbed, whether you’re down or not.”

“what, and i’m as tall as a tree and as bulky as a church? aight then; i’d roll in—but yo, i’d make that dude scale the highest tree in the country first.”

“shucks, it’s no use chattin’ with you, huck finn. you come off as a perfect saphead, clueless as ever.”

i mulled all that over for like two or three days, then decided to test it out. i snagged an old tin lamp and an iron ring, then ventured into the woods, rubbin’ like crazy till i sweated buckets, hyping up on buildin’ a palace and sellin’ the drip—but nada, no genies showed up. so i was like, “yo, this is just one of tom sawyer’s bogus tall tales.” he might’ve been all in on a-rabs and elephants, but me? i was on a whole other wavelength. it straight-up reeked of a sunday-school flex.
