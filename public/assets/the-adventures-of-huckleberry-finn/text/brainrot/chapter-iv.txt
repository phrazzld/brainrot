chapter iv.

so, three or four months rolled by and winter was legit in full effect. i'd been hittin’ school most days—i could spell, read, and write a bit, and even drop the multiplication table up to “six times seven is thirty-five” (ngl, i ain’t tryna flex math beyond that even if i lived forever). math just wasn’t my vibe.

at first, school was mad lame, but eventually i got to the point where i could tolerate it. whenever i was hella tired, i’d play hooky and then hide out the next day, which actually recharged my mood. the more i hit school, the easier it got to roll with it. i was also slowly catchin’ on to the widow’s ways, which weren’t as harsh on me no more. livin’ in a crib and crashin’ on a proper bed was a tight squeeze, but before the deep freeze hit, i’d sometimes dip out and sleep rough in the woods—that was a legit break. i still dug the old ways best, but i was low-key feelin’ the new lifestyle too. the widow was like, “you’re comin’ along slow but steady, and i’m super proud of you.”

one morning at breakfast, i accidentally flipped the salt-cellar. i was about to toss some salt over my left shoulder to shake off bad luck, but miss watson swooped in and clapped me down, yellin’, “take your hands away, huckleberry; you’re always makin’ a hot mess!” the widow tried to slide some good vibes my way, but i knew that wasn’t enough to ward off the curse. so after breakfast, i bounced out feelin’ all jittery and anxious, wonderin’ where this bad luck was gonna hit next. there are ways to dodge some jinx, but this one wasn’t in the playbook—so i just trudged along low-spirited and on high alert.

i rolled down to the front garden and clambered over the stile in the high board fence. there was about an inch of fresh snow on the ground, and i spotted someone’s tracks. they came up from the quarry, hung around the stile for a minute, then trailed along the garden fence. it was hella weird they didn’t actually dip in, after chillin’ there so long. i couldn’t figure it out. i was about to follow ‘em, but first i stooped down to inspect the tracks. at first, nothing stood out—but then i noticed a cross carved into the left boot heel with huge nails, like some ritual to keep the devil away.

i bolted in a flash, sprintin’ down the hill while glancing over my shoulder, but saw no one. i made it to judge thatcher’s pad as quick as humanly possible. he was like:

“why, my boy, you’re all outta breath. did you come for your interest?”

“no, sir,” i shot back, “but is there some for me?”

“oh, yes—a half-yearly just dropped last night—over a hundred and fifty dollars. quite a fortune for you. you better let me roll it in with your six thousand, ‘cause if you keep it, you’ll just blow it.”

“no, sir,” i replied, “i don’t wanna spend it. i don’t want it at all—nor the six thousand, for real. i want you to take it; i wanna give it to you—the whole six thousand and everything.”

he looked totally shook, like he couldn’t even compute it, and asked, “why, what can you mean, my boy?”

i snapped, “don’t ask me no questions, please. you’re gonna take it—won’t you?”

he replied, “well, i’m puzzled. is something the matter?”

i clapped back, “just take it, and don’t ask nothin’—so i won’t have to spin any lies.”

after a beat of deep thought, he said, “oho-o! i think i get it. you wanna sell all your property to me—not just gift it. that’s the real deal.”

then he scribbled something on a paper, read it over, and declared, “there; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ that means i bought it off you and paid for it. here’s a dollar for you. now you sign it.”

so i signed, and bounced.

miss watson’s nay nay, jim, had a hairball as big as your fist—straight-up snatched from the fourth stomach of an ox—and he claimed it was magic, sayin’ there was a spirit inside that knew all the tea. so that night, i rolled up to him and dropped that pap was back in action, cuz i peeped his tracks in the snow. i needed the lowdown on what he was gonna do and if he was stickin’ around. jim pulled out his massive hairball, muttered something over it, then held it up and dropped it on the floor. it hit solid and barely rolled an inch. jim tried again a few times, and it acted the same. then he got down on his knees, pressed his ear to it like he was testing a new app, but nada—it wouldn’t spill a word. he said sometimes it don’t chat without some serious moolah. i told him i had this old slick counterfeit quarter that was totally janky—since the brass peeked through the silver, and it wouldn’t pass legit, even if the brass was hidden, ‘cause it was so greasy it always gave it away. (i kept mum about that dollar from the judge, obviously.) i said it was whack money, but maybe the hairball wouldn’t even notice the difference. jim took a good whiff, chomped it, and rubbed it like he was troubleshooting a glitch, then promised he’d tweak things so the hairball would think it was real. he planned to slice open a raw irish potato, shove the quarter in between, and keep it there all night; so by morning, no brass would be showin’, it wouldn’t be greasy, and anyone in town could swipe it in a minute—let alone the hairball. i mean, i remembered a potato pullin’ that trick before, but i’d straight-up forgotten.

jim slid the quarter under the hairball, then knelt and listened again. this time, he said the hairball was all good—that it’d drop my entire fortune if i let it. i was like, “bet, go on.” so the hairball finally dished out its secret through jim, and jim passed the deets along. he said:

“yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do. sometimes he spec he’ll go ’way, en den agin he spec he’ll stay. de bes’ way is to res’ easy en let de ole man take his own way. dey’s two angels hoverin’ roun’ ’bout him. one uv ’em is white en shiny, en t’other one is black. de white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. a body can’t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las’. but you is all right. you gwyne to have considable trouble in yo’ life, en considable joy. sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you’s gwyne to git well agin. dey’s two gals flyin’ ’bout you in yo’ life. one uv ’em’s light en t’other one is dark. one is rich en t’other is po’. you’s gwyne to marry de po’ one fust en de rich one by en by. you wants to keep ’way fum de water as much as you kin, en don’t run no resk, ’kase it’s down in de bills dat you’s gwyne to git hung.”

when i lit my candle and rolled up to my room that night, there sat pap, his own self!
