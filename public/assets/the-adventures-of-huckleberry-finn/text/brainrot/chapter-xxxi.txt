chapter xxxi.

we didn't stop at any town for days and days; we just cruised straight down the river. we were down south in that warm weather, hella far from home. i started spotting trees draped with spanish moss, hangin’ off like long, gray beards. it was the first time i ever peeped that vibe, and it made the woods look super solemn and dismal. so the frauds figured they were outta the danger zone, and they started doin’ their village hustle again.

first, they did a lecture on temperance; but they didn't earn enough coin for either of 'em to get tipsy. then in another village, they kicked off a dance school; but they danced about as well as a kangaroo on ice, so after one lame prance the public yeeted them right outta town. another time they tried to rock some yellocution; but they didn’t get far before the crowd stood up, dropped a heavy barrage of cussing on them, and chased them off. they dabbled in missionary work, mesmerizing, doctoring, fortune-tellin’, and a bunch of oddball hustles; but nothing clicked, fam. so eventually, they went totally broke and just chilled by the raft as it floated along, mulling over their woes half a day at a time in a deep, desperate blue mood.

and eventually they switched it up and started layin’ their heads together in the wigwam, chattin’ low and on the down-low for two or three hours straight.

jim and i got real uneasy—we weren't feelin' the vibe. we figured they were plotting some seriously shady deviltry, like breakin’ into somebody’s house or store, or even divin’ into the counterfeit cash game—something wild. so we got pretty scared and made a pact that we’d never mess with that, and if we even got the slightest hint of it, we’d ghost them hard and dip out, no cap.

so, early one morning, we stashed the raft in a solid, safe spot about two miles downstream from a run-down village called pikesville, and the king hit shore and told us to stay low while he peeped around town to see if anyone had caught wind of the royal nonesuch yet. in my head, i was thinkin’, “house to rob, you mean? and when you finish robbin’ it, you’re gonna come back wonderin’ what happened to me, jim, and the raft—and you'll be left totally puzzled.”

and he said if he wasn’t back by midday, then the duke and i would know everything was cool, and we were to come along.

so we chilled where we were. the duke was freaking out and sweatin’ all over, mad sour—callin’ us out for every little mishap, and nothing we did was right; he nitpicked every move. something shady was definitely brewin’. i was hyped when midday came and the king hadn’t shown up; maybe we had a chance to flip the script—and maybe even level up our situation.

so me and the duke went up to the village, scopin’ out the king, and eventually found him in the back room of a low-key dive, all cramped up, with a bunch of loafers raggin’ on him for kicks, and he was cussin’ and threatenin’ with all his might—so messed up he couldn’t even walk or fight back.

the duke started goin’ off on him like he was an old fool, and the king fired back full-on sass; and the second they got into it, i dipped quick, shakin’ the reefs out of my legs, and tore down the river road like a deer on the run, 'cause i knew this was our chance; i decided it’d be a long day before they saw me or jim again. i got there totally winded but mad joyful, and then i shouted:

“set her loose, jim! we’re all right now!”

but there wasn’t any answer, and nobody came out of the wigwam. jim was gone! i kept hollerin’—one shout, then another—while runnin’ through the woods, whoopin’ and screechin’; but it was no good—old jim was straight-up gone. then i sat down and broke into tears; i just couldn’t help it. but i didn’t stay down too long. soon i got back on the road, tryna figure out what to do next, and i ran into a boy walkin’, so i asked him if he’d seen a strange nay nay dressed all kinds of quirky, and he goes:

“yes.”

“whereabouts?” i asked.

“down at silas phelps’ place, two miles down from here. he’s a runaway nay nay, and they got him. you lookin’ for him?”

“you bet i ain’t! i ran into him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said that if i hollered he’d cut out my livers, and told me to lay low—so i did. i've been stuck there ever since, afraid to come out.”

“well,” he says, “you don't need to be scared no more, 'cause they've got him. he ran off down south, sometimes.”

“it's a good job they got him.”

“well, i reckon! there's a two hundred dollar reward on him. it's like snaggin’ cash off the street.”

“yes, it is—and i coulda had it if i were big enough; i saw him first. who caught him?”

“it was some old dude—a stranger—and he sold his chance with him for forty dollars, 'cause he had to hit the river and couldn’t wait. think about that, man! you’d be waitin’ even if it took seven years.”

“that’s me, always,” i say. “but maybe his chance isn’t worth more if he's sellin’ it so cheap. maybe there's something shady about it.”

“but it is—straight as a string. i peeped the handbill myself. it spells out everything about him, dot for dot—paints him like a legit picture, and even tells you which plantation he's from, right below new orleans. no sirree, there ain't any fuss about that speculation, trust me. say, gimme a chaw tobacker, will ya?”

i had none, so he bounced. i returned to the raft and sat in the wigwam to think, but couldn’t figure any plan out. i racked my brain until it hurt, but i just couldn’t spot a way out of the mess. after this epic journey, and all the crazy stuff we did for those scoundrels, it all came to nothing—everything got busted and ruined—'cause they had the guts to serve jim such a trick and enslave him for life, among strangers too, all for a lame forty dollars.

once i thought to myself, it’d be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home with his family—even if he stayed a slave—than to be stuck among strangers. so i figured i'd write a letter to tom sawyer and let him know to tell miss watson where jim was. but i quickly scrapped that plan for two reasons: she'd be pissed off and grossed out by his shady, ungrateful bounce, and she'd probably just sell him down the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nay nay, and they'd make jim feel that every single day, leaving him all ornery and humiliated. and then, think of me! word would spread that huck finn helped a nay nay get his freedom; and if i ever crossed paths with anyone from that town again, i’d be ready to crawl around lickin’ their boots in shame. that's just how it goes—a person does something low-down, then he don’t wanna face the fallout, thinkin’ that as long as he can keep it hidden, it ain’t a disgrace.

that was my fix exactly. the more i dug into it, the more my conscience started grindin’ on me, and i got increasingly wicked, low-down, and ornery. and then, outta nowhere, it hit me that the plain ol’ hand of providence was smacking me in the face—letting me know that my wickedness was under constant watch from up there in heaven—while i was out here stealin’ a poor old woman’s nay nay who’d never done me no harm, and now it was showin’ me that there’s always some big presence keepin’ tabs, not gonna let this miserable business slide any further. i straight-up froze, terrified.

i did my best to ease my mind by sayin’ i was brought up wicked, so it wasn’t all on me; but deep inside, something kept whisperin’, “there’s sunday school—you coulda gone to it; and if you had, they’d have schooled you that anyone actin’ like you with that nay nay is headed straight for everlasting fire.”

that made me shiver. i almost made up my mind to pray, to try and stop bein’ that messed-up kid and do better. so i knelt down, but the words just wouldn’t come. why wouldn’t they? it wasn’t like i could hide this from him or from myself. i knew exactly why—they were blocked ‘cause my heart wasn’t in the right place; i wasn’t square; i was straight-up double-dealin’. i was pretendin’ to give up sin, but deep down, i was clingin’ to the biggest sin of them all. i was tryna force my mouth to say i’d do the right, clean thing, and go write to that nay nay’s owner to report his whereabouts; but deep down, i knew it was a lie, and he knew it, too. you can’t pray a lie—I learned that the hard way.

so i was drowning in trouble, all kinds of stressed, not knowin’ what to do. finally, i had an idea; i said, i’ll go write that letter—and then see if i can pray. man, it was wild how light i felt immediately, like a feather, with all my problems disappearin’. so i grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil, totally stoked, and sat down to write:

“miss watson, your runaway nay nay jim is down here two miles below pikesville, and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.

huck finn.”

i felt amazing, totally washed clean of sin for the first time in my life, and i knew i could pray now. but i didn’t jump right in; i put the paper down and sat there, deep in thought—thinkin’ about how dope it was that everything went down like this, and how close i came to bein’ lost and doomed. i kept reminiscin’ about our river trip; i kept picturin’ jim all the time – in the day, at night, sometimes under moonlight, sometimes amid crazy storms, and we were just floatin’, chattin’, singin’, and laughin’. somehow, i couldn’t find any reason to harden my heart against him—instead, i only felt the warmest vibes. i remembered him standin’ on his own watch instead of callin’ me over so i could catch more z’s; i remembered how stoked he was when i emerged from the fog; and when i met him again in the swamp near that old beef zone; and every single time he’d call me honey, pat me, and do everything to show he cared—always bein’ so solid. then i remembered the time i saved him by fibbin’ that we had smallpox onboard, and he was so grateful he said i was the best friend old jim ever had, the only one he got now; then, outta nowhere, i glanced at that paper.



it was mad savage thoughts and even mad savage words, but they got dropped anyway. and i let 'em ride, no edits—i was like, "cool, let that sit," and never even peeped reforming again. i totally yeeted that whole idea from my brain and was like, "time to flex my wicked side once more," cuz that’s how i was bred, and the other path just wasn’t my vibe. and real talk, for a starter i was all about jacking jim out of slavery again; and if i could cook up something even more extra, i’d go for it too—since i was in it for life, i might as well go all in, no cap.

then i got my mind in gear, brainstorming like a total meme lord on how to pull it off, flipping through ideas like a netflix binge; and finally, i landed on a plan that totally suited my drip. so i scoped out a woody island vibe down the river, and as soon as it got hella dark, i snuck out on my raft, slid for it, stashed it there, and then bounced. i crashed hard all night, woke up pre-dawn, grabbed some brekkie, threw on my store threads, bundled up some extra gear, hopped in my canoe, and paddled towards shore. i landed right under what i pegged as phelps’s spot, hid my bundle in the woods, then rigged the canoe by flooding it and loading it up with rocks so it’d be sunk in a secret spot—about a quarter-mile below a chill little steam sawmill on the bank.

so, i hit the road, and as i cruised past the mill, i peeped a sign that read “phelps’s sawmill,” and when i rolled up to the farm-houses a couple hundred yards further, i had my eyes on full alert but didn’t spot anyone—even though the daylight was on point. but i was cool with it, cuz i wasn’t tryna see anyone just yet—I only had to get the lay of the land. according to my master plan, i was gonna slide up from the village, not from below. so i scoped it out quick and dipped straight for town. and yo, the very first dude i bumped into was the duke. he was flexing a billy for the “royal nonesuch”—a three-night performance—like that other time. the nerve of these clout chasers was wild! i was all up in his grill before he could even dip. he looked hella shook, and goes:

  “hel-lo! where’d you pop off from?”

then, all hyped and eager, he adds, “where’s the raft?—it chillin’ in a solid spot?”

i was like, “ngl, that’s exactly what i was about to ask, your grace.”

then his vibe flipped and he goes, “what was your plan for asking me?”

“well,” i say, “when i peeped the king in that dump yesterday, i was like, ‘we ain’t getting him home for hours until he’s less lit,’ so i started loitering around town to kill time. then some dude slid up offering me ten cents to help him haul a skiff over the river for a sheep, so i jumped on that hustle; but when we were tryna drag the sheep to the boat, and the dude left me clutching half the rope while he pushed it along, the sheep was too beefy and broke free, and we chased it all over the hood until we finally caught up at dusk. then we carted it over, and i bounced for the raft. when i rolled in and saw the raft was straight-up ghost, i was like, “they got into deep drama and had to dip; and they jacked my nay nay—the only nay nay i got in the world—and now i’m stuck in this wild-ass place with no property, no clout, and zero means to hustle;” so i parked and bawled my eyes out. i ended up crashing in the woods all night. but yo, what became of the raft then?—and jim—poor jim!

“blamed if i know—that is, what’s become of the raft. that old fool scored a trade for forty bucks, and when we found him in that dump, the loafers swapped half-dollars with him and snagged every cent except what he spent on whisky; and when i hauled him home late last night and peeped the raft was a no-show, we were all like, ‘that little rascal jacked our raft, shook us up, and dipped down the river.’”

“i would never ghost my nay nay, would i?—the only nay nay i had in the world, and the only real asset.”

“we never even peeped that. facts are, i reckon we started vibing with him as if he were our nay nay; yep, we legit considered him that—no cap, we had mad drama for him. so when we found the raft gone and our pockets were totally dry, our only move was to give the royal nonesuch one more spin. and i’ve been pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. where’s that ten cents? hand it over.”

i had some decent cash, so i slid him ten cents, but begged, “spend it on some munchies and hook me up a bit,” cuz that was all i had, and i hadn’t grubbed since yesterday. he kept it on mute. next minute, he spins on me and goes:

“do you reckon that nay nay would snitch on us? we’d peel him if he did that!”

“how would he snitch? didn’t he bounce?”

“no! that old fool sold him, and never even split the cash with me, and now the money’s ghost.”

“sold him?” i say, starting to tear up; “bro, he was my nay nay, and that was my cash. where is he?—i want my nay nay back.”

“well, you can’t get your nay nay, that’s just how it is—so zip your yap. listen up—do you really think you’d dare snitch on us? blamed if i’d ever trust you. like, if you tried to snitch on us—”

he paused, and i’ve never seen the duke look that extra ugly before. i started whimpering, and said:

“i don’t wanna snitch on nobody; and i ain’t got time for that, no cap. i gotta bounce and find my nay nay.”

he looked seriously shook, with his bills fluttering on his arm, deep in thought, wrinkling his forehead like he was processing a cringe meme. finally, he goes:

“i’ll drop some deets. we gotta chill here for three days. if you promise not to snitch, and not let the nay nay snitch, i’ll spill exactly where to find him.”

so i promised, and he goes:

“a farmer by the name of silas ph—” then he trailed off. see, he started droppin’ truth, but then paused and overthought it, and i figured he was just switching his vibe. and he was. he didn’t trust me fully; he needed me out of the picture for the whole three days. so pretty soon he says:

“the dude who bought him is called abram foster—abram g. foster—and he lives like forty miles back in the sticks, on the road to lafayette.”

“all right,” i say, “i can trek that in three days. i’ll bounce this very afternoon.”

“no you won’t, you’re bouncin’ now; and don’t waste any time or start chattin’ up a storm. just keep your tongue zipped and roll out, alright? then you won’t catch any beef with us, got it?”

that was the order i was vibing with, and that’s what i played for. i needed to be free to work my hustle.

“so scram,” he says, “and you can tell mr. foster whatever you wanna drop. maybe you can spin it so he believes that jim is your nay nay—some idiots don’t even need receipts—leastways i heard that’s a thing down south. and when you tell him that the flyer and the reward are bogus, maybe he’ll buy it when you break down the master plan for bustin’ ‘em out. bounce now, and spill whatever, but keep your trap shut from here to there.”

so i dipped and bounced for the back country. i didn’t keep looking back, but lowkey i felt like he was stalking my vibe. still, i knew i could wear him out eventually. i rolled straight out into the wild for about a mile before i doubled back through the woods toward phelps’s. i figured i had to lock in my plan without messin’ around, cuz i needed to zip jim’s lip until these fools could ghost. i wasn’t tryna spark beef with their type. i’d peeped enough of them, and just wanted to be rid of that drama.
