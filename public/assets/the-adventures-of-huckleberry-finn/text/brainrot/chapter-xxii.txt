chapter xxii.

they swarmed up to sherburn’s crib, going off like a pack of savage tribes, yellin’ and rampagin’, makin’ way or gettin’ flattened to mush—it was a brutal sight. even the kids were leadin’ the charge, screamin’ and dodgin’ outta harm’s way; every window along the road was jammed with women peepin’ out, and there were nay nay boys chillin’ in every tree, with dudes and ladies leanin’ over every fence; and just when the mob got close, those on watch would scatter right back before gettin’ caught.

a ton of the women and girls were bawlin’ and trippin’, scared out of their minds.

they piled up in front of sherburn’s palings as densely as possible, the noise so crazy you couldn’t even hear your own thoughts. the whole space was like a tight twenty-foot yard. someone started hollerin’, “tear down the fence! tear down the fence!” and then chaos erupted—ripping, tearin’, smashing—and the front wall of the crowd began rollin’ in like one massive wave.

just then, sherburn steps onto the roof of his little front porch, clutchin’ a double-barrel piece, and stands there all chill and deliberate, not sayin’ a word. instantly, the racket died down, and the wave of people sucked back like they just failed a vibe check.

sherburn stayed iced out, just starin’ down at the mob. the silence was hella creepy and uncomfortable. he slowly scanned the crowd, and every time his gaze hit someone, they tried to stare him down—but couldn’t, so they dropped their eyes like they were caught slippin’. then, outta nowhere, sherburn let out this laugh—not the chill, feel-good kind, but one that felt like biting into bread loaded with sand.

then he goes, slow and scornful:

“yo, the idea of you mobbin’ and lynchin’ someone is straight-up hilarious, no cap. the notion that you think you got enough guts to off a dude is peak cringe. like, you’re wild enough to tar and feather those lonely, outcast chicks that wander by—did that puff you up enough to think you could take down a real man? bruh, a man’s safe as long as there’s like ten thousand of your type around him—as long as it’s day and you ain’t lurkin’ in his shadow.

“do i know you? i know you full-on, fam. i grew up in the south and chilled in the north too, so i got the full tea on the average dude. truth is, most men are total cowards. up north, they let anyone walk all over ‘em and go home prayin’ for a humble spirit; while down south, one dude alone can stop a whole stagecoach crew in daylight and rob ‘em all. your papers call you brave so much that you think you’re the real deal—when really, you’re just as basic as everyone else.

“why don’t your juries hang murderers? ‘cause they’re shook, scared that the victim’s crew will come and blast ‘em in the dark—and that’s exactly what they’d do.

“so they always let these guys slide; then at night, a man sneaks out with a hundred masked wimps and lynches the villain. your epic fail is that you rolled up without a true man; that’s one major mistake—and on top of that, you didn’t come in the dark with your masks. you only brought half a man—buck harkness, over there—and if you hadn’t started with him, you’d have blown the guy away, period.

“look, you never really wanted this mess. the average dude don’t like trouble or danger—and neither do you. but if even half a man—like buck harkness—yells ‘lynch him! lynch him!’ you get so scared you can’t back down, afraid you’ll be exposed as the coward you are, so you cling to that half-man’s vibe, comin’ up here and swearin’ big promises. a mob is the most pathetic thing out there; it’s just a rag-tag army that borrows its courage from the mass hype and its leaders. but a mob without a real man at the helm? that’s the epitome of pitiful. so here’s what you do: drop your tail, bounce back home, and crawl into a hole. if any real lynching is ever gonna go down, it’ll be done in the dark, southern style—when they roll in with their masks and bring a true man. now bounce—and take your half-man with you.”

– he chucks his piece across his left arm and cocks it while droppin’ that truth bomb.

the mob split like, whoa, and then scattered in every direction—and buck harkness trailed after them, lookin’ lowkey pathetic. i could’ve stayed to peep more, but nah, i wasn’t feelin’ it.

i bounced over to the circus and chilled out back until the watchman rolled by, then dipped under the tent. i had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some extra cash, but i figured better save it ‘cause you never know when you’ll need that dough when you’re far from home and among random peeps. gotta stay woke. i’m down to drop cash on circuses if the vibe calls, but there’s zero point in wastin’ it.

this circus was straight-up next level. the sight was epic when they rolled in, in pairs—a gentleman and a lady side by side—with the dudes rockin’ just their drawers and undershirts, no shoes or stirrups, chillin’ with their hands on their thighs like it was no biggie—probably about twenty of ‘em—and every lady was a total vibe: flawless, drop-dead gorgeous, legit queens decked out in gear that looked like it cost a fortune and dripped in diamonds. it was a boss-level aesthetic; i ain’t never seen anything so lit. then, one by one, they stood up and strutted around the ring, weavin’ in a smooth, wavy, graceful motion—the dudes lookin’ all tall and airy as they bobbed their heads under the tent roof, and every lady’s rose-patterned dress flutterin’ soft and silky around her hips, makin’ her look like the prettiest parasol ever.

then they kicked it into high gear, dancin’ faster and faster—one foot in the air then the other—with the horses leanin’ more and more, and the ringmaster circlin’ the center pole, whippin’ it out and shoutin’ “hi! hi!” while the clown dropped savage one-liners behind him; soon enough, everyone dropped the reins—ladies poppin’ their knuckles on their hips and gentlemen foldin’ their arms—and then the horses leaned over and did their wild hump dance! one by one, they skipped into the ring and served the sweetest bow i’ve ever seen, then dashed off, and the crowd went absolutely wild, clappin’ and cheerin’.

all through the circus, they pulled off the wildest, most mind-blowing stunts; and the clown’s antics were straight killin’ it—making everyone lose it. the ringmaster couldn’t even throw a word at him ‘cause the clown was always comin’ back with the sickest, quickest comebacks, so on-point it was unreal. i still can’t figure out how he dropped so many zingers all at once; i couldn’t rack that up in a whole year. then, outta nowhere, a drunk dude tried to crash the ring—yellin’ he wanted to ride, claimin’ he could ride as hard as any pro. they argued and tried to kick him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show stalled. then the crowd started hollerin’ and mockin’ him, which ticked him off so bad he started wreckin’ stuff; that got the people hyped, and a bunch of dudes piled off the benches and swarmed the ring, yellin’, “knock him down! toss him out!” while a couple of women screamed. so the ringmaster stepped in and made a quick speech, sayin’ he hoped there wouldn’t be any drama, and that if the guy promised no more trouble, he’d let him ride if he could hang on. everyone cracked up and agreed, and the dude hopped on. the moment he bounced on, the horse went wild—buckin’ and jumpin’ like crazy—with two circus bros clutchin’ its bridle tryna calm it, the drunk dude hangin’ on for dear life around its neck, heels flyin’ with every jump, and the whole crowd standin’ up yellin’ and laughin’ ‘til tears rolled down. and sure enough, after all the circus men did their best, the horse broke loose, blastin’ around the ring like a wild nation, with that drunk dude hangin’ on, first one leg swingin’ low on one side, then the other, and the people went absolutely bonkers. not gonna lie, i was shakin’ from the danger. but soon enough, he managed to mount the horse properly, grabbed the bridle, swayin’ this way and that; and the next minute, he sprang up, dropped the bridle, and stood tall—while the horse kept blastin’ around like it was on fire. he just stood there, cruisin’ like he’d never been wasted in his life—and then he started droppin’ his clothes, slingin’ ‘em all over. he shed so many outfits they practically clogged the air—seventeen suits in total. and then, boom, he transformed into this slim, handsome dude, decked out in the most fly, gaudy, and pretty threads ever, whipped that horse into a frenzy with his whip, and finally skipped off after a crisp bow and wild dance straight to the dressing room, while everyone lost it with amazement.

then the ringmaster peeped that he’d been totally played, and he was the wildest, sickest ringmaster you’d ever see, i swear. like, it was one of his own crew! he cooked up that whole prank out of his own brain, not tellin’ a soul. i felt pretty sheepish for gettin’ duped, but there’s no way i’d wanna be in his shoes—not for a thousand bucks. i dunno, maybe there are tougher circuses out there, but i haven’t seen ‘em yet. anyway, that show was more than enough for me; wherever i come across that vibe again, you know i’m all in.

that night’s show went down, but only about a dozen peeps showed up—just enough to cover the bills. they were crackin’ up non-stop, which ticked off the duke; and everyone bailed before the show ended, except for one boy who was out cold. so the duke goes, “these arkansas lunkheads can’t handle shakespeare—they only get low comedy, or maybe even something even more trash, i swear. i can totally size their style.” so next morning, he grabs huge sheets of wrapping paper, slaps on some black paint, prints out flyers, and sticks ‘em all over the village. the flyer read:

at the courthouse! for 3 nights only! the world-renowned tragedians david garrick the younger! and edmund keen the elder! from the london and continental theatres, in their epic tragedy of the king’s camelopard or the royal nonesuch!!! admission: 50 cents.

then in giant letters: ladies and children not admitted.

“there,” he declares, “if that line doesn’t hook ’em, then i don’t even know arkansas!”
