chapter xxvii.

i crept up to their doors, all stealth mode, ears on deck—they were snorin’ hardcore. so i tiptoed like a boss, sliding downstairs smooth. not a peep was comin’ from anywhere. i peeped through a slim crack in the dinin’-room door and spotted the dudes watchin’ the corpse, asleep in their chairs. the door into the parlor—where the corpse was chillin’—was open and lit by a candle in both rooms. i strolled through, noticed that in the parlor it was just peter’s leftover crew, so i slid on by; but the front door was locked, and the key was nowhere to be found. just then, i heard footsteps comin’ down behind me. i bolted back into the parlor, did a quick scan, and the only legit spot to hide the bag was in the coffin. the lid was propped up about a foot, exposin’ the dead man’s face with a wet cloth draped over it and his shroud on. i carefully tucked the money-bag under the lid, just below where his hands were crossed—so cold it gave me the creeps—and then i dashed back across the room, slid behind the door for cover.

turns out the one comin’ was mary jane. she approached the coffin all gentle-like, knelt down to peek inside; then she lifted her handkerchief, and i peeped that she started cryin’, even though i couldn’t hear her over the silence, with her back turned to me. i slipped out, and as i passed the dinin’-room, i peeped through the crack to make sure the watchers hadn’t clocked me; everything was chill—they hadn’t stirred a bit.

i slinked back to bed, feelin’ ruther blue ‘cause after all that effort and mad risk, the whole thing played out like a dumpster fire. i thought, if it stays where it is, it’s all gravy; ‘cause when we dip down the river a hundred miles or so, i can drop mary jane a letter, and she can come through and snag it; but that ain’t the move that’s gonna go down—the real deal is, the cash will eventually be found when they come to screw down that coffin lid. then the king’s gonna grab it back, and it’ll be a long day before he gives anyone another shot to swipe it. of course, i wanted to slide down and grab it outta there, but i didn’t even try—‘cause every minute it was gettin’ lighter, and soon enough one of those watchers might stir, and i’d get busted—with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hired me to handle. i ain’t tryna get mixed up in that shady biz, i told myself.

when i came downstairs in the mornin’, the parlor was locked up and the watchers had dipped. it was just the fam, widow bartley, and our crew. i peeped their faces, tryin’ to suss if any drama had gone down, but i couldn’t really tell.

around midday, the undertaker rolled in with his man, and they placed the coffin smack in the middle of the room on a couple chairs; then they lined up all our chairs in rows, borrowin’ extra from the neighbors till the hall, parlor, and dinin’-room were packed. i peeped that the coffin lid was the same as before, but i didn’t dare check underneath with people all around.

then peeps started to flock in, and the boys and girls snagged front-row seats at the head of the coffin; for like half an hour, everyone shuffled in single file, takin’ a minute to stare at the dead man’s face, with some droppin’ a tear—it was mad still and solemn, with only the girls and boys clutchin’ hankies to their eyes, heads bowed, and low-key sobbin’. nothin’ but the scrape of feet on the floor and some nose-blowin’—‘cause people blow their noses more at a funeral than anywhere else except church.

once the spot was packed, the undertaker glided around in his black gloves with his soft, smooth moves, addin’ final touches, arrangin’ the peeps and stuff all ship-shape and comfy, makin’ not a peep—like a stealthy cat. he never opened his trap; he just maneuvered people around, squeezed in the latecomers, opened up passageways—all done with nods and hand signs. then he parked himself against the wall. seriously, he was the softest, glidiest, stealthiest dude i’ve ever seen; and his smile was rarer than a ham’s grin.

they’d borrowed this dope melodeum—and when everything was set, a young woman sat down and busted it out. it was all screeky and colicky, and everyone jumped in to sing, with peter bein’ the only one really on point, in my humble opinion. then the reverend hobson kicked off his sermon, slow and solemn, startin’ to speak; and straight away, out in the cellar, the wildest commotion ever erupted—a dog, no cap, but this dog made a crazy racket non-stop; the parson had to stand over the coffin and wait—it was so loud you couldn’t even think straight. total awkwardness, and nobody knew what to do. but real quick, that long-legged undertaker flashed a sign at the preacher like, “don’t sweat it—i got you.” then he stooped down and glided along the wall, with only his shoulders peekin’ above the crowd. so he kept glidin’, while the noise and madness escalated; and finally, after circlin’ two sides of the room, he dipped down into the cellar. then in like two seconds, we heard a whack, and the dog finished with a couple insane howls, and then everything went dead silent, and the parson picked up his solemn talk right where he left off. a minute or two later, the undertaker’s back and shoulders were slidin’ along the wall again; he glided around three sides of the room, then straightened up, covered his mouth with his hands, stretched his neck out past the preacher over everyone’s heads, and in a low, raw whisper said, “he had a rat!” then he drooped and slid back to his spot along the wall. you could tell the crowd was hyped and satisfied, ‘cause naturally, they were dyin’ to know. a little tidbit like that don’t cost a dime, and it’s the small moves that make a guy respected and loved. there wasn’t a more popular dude in town than that undertaker.

so, the funeral sermon was on point but damn long and straight-up tiresome; then the king cut in with his usual trash talk, and finally the show wrapped up, with the undertaker sneakin’ up on the coffin with his screwdriver. i was stressin’ and sweatin’ stiff, watchin’ him close as he slid the lid down soft like mush, screwed it shut tight and fast. so there i was! i had no clue if the cash was still in there or not. i thought, “yo, maybe somebody swiped that bag on the low—now how am i supposed to know if i should hit up mary jane or not? suppose she digs it up and finds nada, what would she think of me?” damn, i figured, i might get hunted down and locked up; better to play it low-key, stay dark, and not hit her up at all. this whole mess is a total clusterfuck now; every move to fix it just made it worse a hundred times, and i seriously wish i’d let it be and just dipped out of the whole biz.

they buried him, then we rolled back home, and i started readin’ faces again—I just couldn’t help it, and i couldn’t get no rest. but nothing went down; the faces didn’t spill any tea.

that evenin’, the king swung by and schmoozed everyone, gettin’ all friendly and sweet. he dropped a hint that his congregation back in england would go off if they caught wind of him, so he had to hustle, settle up the estate real quick, and dip out for home. he was mad sorry about bein’ rushed, and everyone felt the same—they wished he could hang longer, but it just wasn’t in the cards. and he said he and william would scoop up the girls and take ‘em home; that got everyone hyped too, ‘cause then the girls would be set with their fam; and the girls themselves were all in—it tickled them so much they forgot they’d ever had any drama—and they told him to sell out as fast as he wanted, they’d be ready. those poor souls were so happy it hurt my heart to see ‘em get played and lied to, but i saw no safe move to step in and flip the script.

and yo, if it wasn’t for the king, he went ahead and tagged the house, the nay nay, and all the property for auction on the spot—sale went down two days after the funeral; though anyone could drop a private bid before if they wanted.

so the next day after the funeral, around noon, the girls’ vibe got hit with the first major shock. a couple of nay nay traders rolled up, and the king flipped them the nay nays on a chill three-day draft deal, and off they bounced – the two bros cruisin’ up the river to memphis, and their mama takin’ the low ride down to orleans. i was like, bro, those girls were straight heartbroken, and i knew the nay nays would have them all emo over grief; they were bawlin’ all over each other, and it had me feelin’ hella sick just peepin’ that mess. the girls were shook – they never in a million years thought they’d see their fam split or sold outta town. i still can’t shake that image of those poor, miserable girls and nay nays clingin’ to each other and cryin’ like lost sims; i swear, i wouldn’t have lasted a minute if i hadn’t known the whole sale was total cap and the nay nays would slide back home in a week or two.

that whole chaos set off a massive stir in town, and a bunch of folks, all basic and flatfooted, started hollerin’ about how scandalous it was to split a mama and her kids like that. it ruffled some of the scammer crew’s feathers; but the old dummy just kept on truckin’, no matter what the duke could throw at him—and i tell ya, the duke was straight-up uneasy, no cap.

next day was auction day, for real. bright and early in the morning, the king and the duke rolled up into the garret and yanked me awake, and i could tell by their mad serious looks that trouble was brewin’. the king kicked it off:

“was you in my room night before last?”

i shot back, “no, your majesty,” – that’s always how i talked to him when just our gang was around.

“was you in there yisterday er last night?”

“no, your majesty.”

“honor bright, now—no lies.”

“honor bright, your majesty, i’m tellin’ you the truth. i ain’t been anywhere near your room since miss mary jane rolled through with you and the duke and gave you the grand tour.”

the duke jumped in, “have you seen anybody else go in there?”

“no, your grace, as far as i can peep, i don’t recall anyone else poppin’ in.”

“stop and think.”

i paused, scoped the sitch, and then said, “yo, i peeped the nay nays roll in there several times.”

both of them practically jumped, lookin’ like they never saw that coming – or maybe they did, lowkey.

then the duke fired off, “what, all of them?”

“na, not all at once – i never clock the whole squad comin’ out at the same time, just one by one.”

“hello! when was that?”

“it was on funeral day, bruh. in the morning – not super early ‘cause i overslept. i was just slidin’ down the ladder when i caught 'em.”

“go on, go on! what did they even do? how’d they act?”

“they didn’t really do any drama. they were quiet AF, tiptoeing out. i clocked that they probably snuck in to do a quick glow-up on your majesty’s room, thinkin’ you were awake; then they peeped that you were still knocked out, and they tried slidin’ out without causin’ a major vibe check – if they hadn’t already accidentally woke you up.”

“damn, this is lit!” the king exclaimed, and both of ‘em looked hella shook and kinda goofy. they just stood there, deep in thought and scratchin’ their heads for a minute, and then the duke let out a raspy chuckle and said:

“yo, it does beat all how neat the nay nays played their hand. they fronted like they were mad sorry to be bouncin’ outta this region! i legit believed they were, and so did you, and so did everybody. don’t ever tell me again that a nay nay ain’t got any theatrical flair. the way they pulled that act, it could fool anybody. in my opinion, there’s pure gold in ‘em. if i had the stacks and a theater, i wouldn’t want a slicker layout than that – and here we are, flippin’ ‘em away for pocket change. and yo, they ain’t even dropped the performance yet. so, where’s that “song” – i mean, that draft?”

“it’s in the bank, just waitin’ to be cashed,” the king replied. “where else would it be?”

“well, that’s cool then, thank goodness.”

i ventured, “yo, is something majorly off?”

the king snapped, “none of your business! keep your head in the game and mind your own affairs – if you got any. while you’re in this town, don’t you ever forget that, you hear?” then he leaned over to the duke, “we just gotta keep it on the down-low and say nothing: mum’s the word.”

as they started slidin’ down the ladder, the duke snickered again and said, “fast flips and micro-profits – it’s a killer hustle, yes.”

the king snapped back at him, “i was tryna secure the bag by sellin’ ’em out so quick. if the profits turn out to be zilch, lacking big time, is it on me any more than it’s on you?”

“well, they’d still be chillin’ in this crib, and we wouldn’t be dealin’ with all this mess if y’all had peeped my advice.”

the king clapped back as safe as he could muster, then pivoted and came after me hard. he tore into me for not comin’ in and spillin’ that i saw the nay nays sneak out of his room all sus-like – like any fool would’ve clocked that somethin’ was off. then he marched off, cussin’ up his own vibe and blamin’ himself for not sleepin’ in and catchin’ his natural chill that morning, swearin’ he’d never let it happen again.

they bounced off jawin’ at each other, and i was mad relieved i had unloaded all that drama on the nay nays without actually hurtin’ them.
