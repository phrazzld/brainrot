chapter xxv.

ngl, the news was blowin’ up town in like two minutes, and you could literally see peeps dashing mad from every angle, throwin’ on their coats on the fly. before long, we found ourselves smack in the middle of a massive mob, and the stompin’ sound was like some serious soldier march. every window and yard was packed, and every minute someone would holler over a fence:

“yo, is that them?”

and some hustlin’ homie with the crew would fire back:

“facts, bet it is.”

when we rolled up to the crib, the street in front was packed tight, with three girls posted at the door. mary jane—rockin’ that redhead drip, which didn’t even matter ‘cause she was straight up stunning, with her face and eyes lit up like pure glory—was hella hyped that her uncles had rolled in. the king threw his arms wide, and mary jane jumped right into ‘em, while the hare-lip bounced over to the duke—and boom! everyone, especially the ladies, was losing it over this epic reunion.

then the king pulled the duke aside—i swear, i totally peeped that move—and glanced around to spot a coffin chillin’ in the corner on two chairs. so, with one hand draped over each other’s shoulder and the other shading their eyes like they were checkin’ out some scandal, the king and the duke strolled all slow and solemn over there. the whole crowd backed off, and the noise died down to a hush, with folks whispering “shh” and the dudes offin’ their hats and droppin’ their heads so hard you could literally hear a pin drop.

when they got there, they leaned in over that coffin, took one savage look, and then burst into tears loud enough to be heard all the way to orleans. they clung together, draping their arms around each other’s necks and leanin’ their chins on one another’s shoulders, and for like three or four minutes, i’ve never seen two dudes cry as hard as that. and, real talk, everyone else got in on it too; the joint got so damp with tears, i’ve never seen anything like it.

then one of ‘em slid to one side of the coffin, the other to the opposite, dropped to his knees, and rested his forehead on the cold wood like he was prayin’ solo. when that went down, the whole mob was hit with next-level feels—everyone broke down and started sobbin’ out loud (even the poor girls got caught up in it). nearly every lady marched over in silent solidarity, planted a solemn kiss on the forehead of one of the girls, rested a hand there, looked up at the sky with tears streamin’ down, and then, boom—they all broke into a fresh round of bawlin’ and wailing so hard it was a straight-up show. i’ve never seen anything so extra, so damn over-the-top.

soon after, the king got back on his feet, shuffled forward a bit, and got all worked up, droppin’ a tear-soaked, flapdoodle speech about how brutal it was for him and his poor bro to lose the dude, and how it hurt that they’d never see him alive again after a grueling four-thousand-mile trek. but yo, that pain got kinda blessed by all the mad today-sympathy and holy tears, so he thanked everyone from the bottom of his heart—and his bro’s heart too—‘cause words were just too weak and cold to express the feels. by the time he was done, he was bawlin’ out a pious, goody-goody amen before totally losing it in another crying fit.

the minute those words dropped, someone in the crowd busted out a doxolojer, and before you knew it, everyone joined in with full send, and it warmed you up like that glow you get when church lets out. music is straight fire; after all that soul-melt and hogwash, i’ve never seen anything refresh the vibe like that, soundin’ so raw and real.

then the king started flexin’ his jaw again, announcin’ that he and his nieces would be hella glad if a few of the family’s main homies rolled in for supper that evening to help sort out the ashes of the departed. he went off sayin’ that if his poor bro chillin’ yonder could talk, he’d have named a crew of folks dear to him—names he dropped left and right in his letters. so here’s who he’d honor: rev. mr. hobson, deacon lot hovey, mr. ben rucker, abner shackleford, levi bell, dr. robinson, plus their wives, and the widow bartley.

rev. hobson and dr. robinson were out on the edge of town on some huntin’ vibes—that is, like, the doc was busy shippin’ a seriously sick dude to the next world while the preacher was, i dunno, pintin’ him right. lawyer bell was off up in louisville on biz, but the rest of the squad was present; they all rolled up, shook hands with the king, dropped a bunch of thank-yous, and had a good chinwag with him. then they did the same with the duke—no words, just constant smilin’ and noddin’ like a bunch of clueless sapheads, while the duke flailed his hands around, goin’ “goo-goo—goo-goo-goo” like some babbling baby who couldn’t form a proper word.

so the king kept on blabberin’, askin’ about basically every single person—and even every dog—in town by name, and droppin’ a load of random tea about stuff that went down in town, with george’s fam, or even peter. he always acted like peter himself sent him the deets—but that was pure cap: he scooped up every little bit from that young flathead we canoed up to the steamboat.

then mary jane scooped up the letter her dad left behind, and the king read it out loud while bawlin’. the letter dished out that the crib and three grand in gold were all for the girls; it also gifted the tanyard (which was totally killin’ it), along with some extra houses and land worth ‘bout seven grand, and three grand in gold to harvey and william, plus spillin’ where six grand in cash was stashed down in the cellar.

so these two scammin’ frauds were like, “we got this, we’ll go fetch it up and keep everything square and above-board,” and then they told me to roll up with a candle. we shut the cellar door behind us, and when they popped the bag open, the cash spilled all over the floor in a mad display of yaller-boys. damn, the way the king’s eyes lit up was unreal! he smacked the duke on the shoulder and goes:

“oh, this ain’t bully or nothing! no cap, i reckon it’s straight up better than the nonesuch, don’t it?”

the duke was totally down with that. they grabbed hold of the yaller-boys, letting ‘em slide through their fingers and clatter onto the floor, and the king went off:

“ain’t no use babblin’ about it; bein’ bros to a rich dead man and standin’ in for leftover furrin heirs is our lane, bilge. this is basically providence on lock. long story short, i’ve tried every hack out there, and there’s literally no better way.”

most folks woulda been chill with that pile on trust, but nah—they had to count it. so they did, and it came out four hundred and fifteen bucks short. the king grumbled:

“dang it, i wonder what the sneaky dude did with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?”

they stressed about it for a minute and tore through the stash huntin’ for the missing cash. then the duke chimed in:

“yo, he was pretty messed up and probably just goofed—i reckon that’s just how he rolls. best move is to let it slide and keep low-key about it. we can totally spare that loss.”

“oh, shucks, yeah, we can spare it. i ain’t fussin’ about that—it’s all about the count, ya feel? we gotta be hella square, open, and above-board. we’re gonna haul this cash upstairs and count it in front of everybody—then nothing’s sus. but when the dead dude claimed there’s six grand, you know, we ain’t tryna—”

“hold up,” the duke interjects, “let’s just fake the deficit,” and he starts pullin’ out some yaller-boys from his pocket.

“that’s an amazin’ idea, duke—you got one rattlin’ clever head on you,” the king goes. “blessed if the old nonesuch ain’t savin’ us again,” as he begins haulin’ out yaller-jackets and stackin’ ‘em up.

it pretty much wrecked ‘em, but yo, they managed to patch up the six grand, clean and clear.

“yo,” says the duke, “i got another idea. let’s haul the cash upstairs, count it, and then hand it over to the girls.”

“oh, duke, lemme hug you right now! that’s the most dazzling idea i’ve ever peeped. you seriously got the most astonishin’ brain i know. this is the ultimate boss move, no cap. let ‘em bring all their sus vibes if they want—this is gonna smack ‘em down.”

when we rolled upstairs, everyone clustered round the table as the king counted out and stacked the cash—three hundred dollars in one stack, broken into twenty sleek little piles. peeps were practically starvin’ for it, lickin’ their chops. then they raked it all back into a bag, and i peeped the king swell up for another epic speech. he goes:

“friends all, my poor bro chillin’ yonder has been mega generous to those left behind in the valley of sorrow. he’s blessed these poor lil lambs he loved and sheltered—now left without a dad or mom. and we who knew him know he’d have gone even harder for ‘em if he wasn’t scared of hurtin’ dear william and me. now, wouldn’t he? i got zero doubt in my mind. so tell me, what kinda brothers would even step in his way at a time like this? and what kinda uncles would dare—yeah, dare—steal such sweet, poor lambs that he loved so damn much? if i know william—and i think i do—well, i’ll just ask him.”

then he spins around, blastin’ a slew of wild hand signals at the duke, who just stares dumb like he’s got a leaky brain; next thing, the duke totally catches the drift, jumps on the king, goin’ all “goo-goo” with pure joy, hugging him like fifteen times before finally chillin’. then the king goes:

“i knew it; i reckon that’ll convince anyone how he really feels. here, mary jane, susan, joanner—take the cash, all of it. it’s the gift from our bro yonder, cold yet joyful.”

mary jane leaped for the king, while susan and the hare-lip did the same for the duke. everyone pressed in, teary-eyed, and nearly every woman patted these two fraudsters on the back, constantly sayin’:

“you beautiful souls!—so lovely!—how could you?”

after that, pretty soon all eyes got back to talkin’ about the deceased—how awesome he was and what a huge loss he’d been—until a big-ass, iron-jawed dude strutted in from outside, just standin’ there listenin’ and starin’, not sayin’ a word. nobody even addressed him ‘cause the king was on a roll and everyone was busy listenin’. the king, mid-speech, goes:

“—they’re the extra tight friends of the dearly departed. that’s why they’re invited tonight; but tomorrow, i want everyone to roll through—every single person; ‘cause he respected and liked everyone, and it only makes sense that his funeral orgies be public.”

and so he kept on rantin’, lovin’ the sound of his own voice, droppin’ bits about his funeral orgies every now and then, just like old times, until the duke couldn’t stand it anymore; so he scribbled on a scrap of paper, “obsequies, you old fool,” folded it up, and started flingin’ it over everyone’s heads like some wild party trick. the king read it, popped it into his pocket, and goes:

“poor william, all messed up as he is, with a heart that’s still lit. he asked me to invite everyone to the funeral—to make ‘em all feel welcome. but don’t sweat it, that was just what i was already planning.”

then he kept on cruisin’, totally calm, droppin’ hints of his funeral orgies every so often like he’d done before. and when he hit the third drop, he goes:

“i say ‘orgies’ not ‘obsequies’—obsequies done got old in england; it’s totally out. now we say orgies ‘cause it nails exactly what you’re after. it’s built from the greek ‘orgo’ meanin’ outside, open, abroad; and the hebrew ‘jeesum’ meanin’ to plant or cover up—hence inter. so, peep it: funeral orgies is just an open, public funeral.”

man, he was the worst i ever struck. then that iron-jawed dude straight-up laughed in his face. everyone was shook—folks were like, “yo, doctor!” and then abner shackleford goes:

“yo, robinson, you ain’t heard? this is harvey wilks.”

the king grinned all hyped, stickin’ his tongue out a bit, and goes:

“is that my poor bro’s legit best friend and doctor? i—”

“keep your hands off me!” snaps the doctor. “you sound like an english dude, don’t you? that’s the worst mimicry i’ve ever heard. you’re peter wilks’s brother! you’re a straight-up fraud, no cap!”

and oh man, how they all went off! they crowded around the doctor, tryna quiet him down and explain that harvey had shown in like forty ways that he was the real deal—knowing everyone’s name (even the dogs’)—beggin’ him not to hurt harvey’s feels or the girls’, and all that extra noise. but it was straight-up useless; the doc stormed off, yellin’ that any dude who pretends to be an englishman and can’t drop the lingo any better than he does is nothing but a fraud and a liar. the poor girls clung to the king, cryin’ their eyes out, when suddenly the doctor spun around and flipped on them. he goes:

“i was your father’s buddy, and i’m still your friend; so listen up as an honest homie who only wants to keep you safe from trouble—ditch that scumbag and have nothing to do with him, that clueless tramp with his bogus greek and hebrew mumbo jumbo. he’s the flimsiest, most basic impostor ever—rolled in here with a bunch of empty names and random facts he picked up somewhere, and you all actually take ‘em as proof, getting played by these dumb pals who should know better. mary jane wilks, you know me as your friend and your selfless homie, too. now listen—kick this pathetic poser out, i beg you. will you?”

mary jane snapped to attention—and damn, she was lookin’ fine—then she declares:

“here’s my answer.”

she hoisted up the bag of cash and shoved it into the king’s hands, sayin’, “take this six grand and invest it however you want for me and my sisters—no receipt, aight?”

then she wrapped her arm around the king on one side, while susan and the hare-lip did the same for the duke. the whole crowd started clappin’ and stompin’ like a wild rave, and the king held his head high, smilin’ like he just won the lotto. the doctor then goes:

“alright; i’m out—i wash my hands of all this. but yo, i warn you, there’ll be a day when just thinkin’ about this moment makes you feel downright sick.”

“alright, doctor,” the king shoots back in a playful roast, “we’ll try to get ‘em to send for you,” which had everyone crackin’ up, callin’ it a prime solid hit.
