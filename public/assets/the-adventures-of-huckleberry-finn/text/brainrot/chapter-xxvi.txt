chapter xxvi.

once everyone bounced, the king asked mary jane how their spare room sitch was lookin’, and she was like, “i got one extra room that’ll work for uncle william, and i can even give my own room to uncle harvey—which is a bit bigger—and i’ll crash with my sisters on a cot; plus, up in the garret there’s a tiny cubby with a pallet in it.” the king then dropped, “that cubby works for my valley,” meanin’ me.

so mary jane took us upstairs and gave us the tour of the digs, which were plain but nice. she mentioned she’d clear out her frocks and other gear from her room if they got in uncle harvey’s way, but he was like, “nah, that’s chill.” the frocks were hung along the wall, with a calico curtain hangin’ down to the floor. there was an old hair trunk in one corner, a guitar-box in another, and a bunch of random knickknacks and trinkets scattered around like how girls deck out a room. the king said it all made the place extra homey and chill, so don’t even mess with it. the duke’s room was kinda small but more than enough, and my cubby was solid too.

that night, they threw down for a big supper with all the men and women there. i ended up standin’ behind the king and duke’s chairs, servin’ them, while the nay nay handled the rest.

mary jane sat at the head of the table with susan right beside her, and went off complainin’ about how harsh the biscuits were, how the preserves were mean, and how the fried chickens were ridiculously tough—all that extra chatter women drop to force out compliments. but everyone already knew everything was tiptop, and they kept throwin’ out stuff like, “how do you get biscuits to brown so perfectly?” and “yo, where’d you snag these amazin’ pickles?” and all that extra humbug, just the usual supper vibe.

when all that was done, the hare-lip and i grabbed the leftover grub in the kitchen, while the rest of the crew—yeah, the nay nay—helped clean up the mess.

the hare-lip started jabberin’ about england, and swear down, i almost believed that the ice was gettin’ mad thin sometimes. she goes:

“did you ever peep the king?”

“who, william fourth? i bet i have—he rolls to our church.”

i knew he was ghost years ago, but kept it on the down-low. so when i said he rolls to our church, she goes:

“what—regular?”

“yeah—regular. his pew’s sittin’ right opposite ours, on the other side of the pulpit.”

“i thought he was livin’ in london?”

“well, he is. where else would he be?”

“but i thought you were in sheffield?”

i was totally stumped. i had to act like i got choked on a chicken bone just to buy some time to figure my exit. then i goes:

“i mean he rolls to our church regularly when he’s in sheffield—only in the summer, when he pops over for his sea baths.”

“yo, but how you gonna take sea baths when sheffield ain’t even on the sea?”

“well, who even said it was?”

“yo, you did!”

“i didn’t say anythin’ else.”

“you did!”

“i didn’t.”

“you did.”

“i never said nothin’ of the kind.”

“so, what did you even say then?”

“i said he comes to take the sea baths—that’s literally what i said.”

“so then, how’s he gonna take sea baths if there’s no sea?”

“check it,” i says, “did you ever peep any congress-water?”

“yeah.”

“so did you have to go to congress to get it?”

“nah, not at all.”

“well, then, neither does william fourth need to hit the sea for a sea bath. so, how does he even cop it, then?”

yo, check it: down here they be gettin’ that congress-water in barrels. all the way in the palace at sheffield, they got lit furnaces, and dude wants his water scaldin’. they can’t boil up that much water way out at sea—no cap, they ain’t got the hookups for it.

oh, i getchu now. you coulda dropped that deets earlier and saved mad time.

when she drops that “i see,” i’m like, boom—outta the woods again, feelin’ comfy and stoked. then she goes:

“yo, you hit up church too?”

“yeah—on the reg.”

“and where you chill?”

“obviously in our pew.”

“whose pew though?”

“hella ours—your uncle harvey’s be it.”

“his? like, what vibe he got with a pew?”

“he needs that pew to be set up proper. what did you figure he was about?”

“man, i thought he’d be flexin’ up in the pulpit.”

dang, snapped—i totally spaced that he was a preacher. i was stuck, so i racked my brain like a game of chicken bones and came through with another take. then i go:

“seriously though, you think a church ain’t got like only one preacher?”

“what, are they tryna drop a sermon rap battle or somethin’?”

“what!—preach for a king? dude, i ain’t never peeped a chick like you. they be stackin’ up, no cap, seventeen preachers.”

seventeen?! damn, no cap, i wouldn’t roll out a line that long even if i hit legendary status. that squad would def take like a whole week, fr.

ikr, they ain’t all droppin’ sermons the same day—only one actually gets to spit.

so, like, what do the rest do then?

oh, they be straight chillin’, lollin’ around, passin’ the plate—and doing one thing or another. but mostly, they just don’t do much.

so yo, what’s their vibe for then?

they’re all about style, bruh. you seriously don’t know nothin’?

aight, i ain’t tryna vibe with that dumb talk. how are servants treated in england, bro? do they treat ‘em better than we treat our nay nay?

nah, dude! a servant ain’t nothin’ over there. they treat ‘em even worse than dogs, facts.

ain’t they hooked up with holidays like we do—christmas, new year’s week, and fourth of july vibes?

bro, listen up! you could tell if you ain’t been to england by that. like, hare-l—i mean joanna, they don’t even see a holiday from one year’s end to the next; never hit up the circus, theater, nay nay shows, or random spots.

and church?

nah—church ain’t poppin’.

but yo, you always caught those church vibes.

man, i totally spaced that i was on duty as the old man’s servant. then, in the next sec, i got hit with some whack explanation about how a valley (whatever that is) ain't like a regular servant and has to hit church whether he wants to or not, sittin’ with the fam ‘cause that’s the law. i laid it down pretty lame, and when i was done, i could tell she wasn’t vibin’. so she goes:

“honest injun, fr, you been spinnin’ mad lies, haven’t ya?”

“honest injun,” i say.

“none of it at all?”

“none of it, promise. not a cap in it.”

“put your hand on that book and state it.”

i peeped that it was just a dictionary, so i slapped my hand on it and recited. she seemed a bit more chill, then goes:

“aight, i might buy some of that, but i hope to believe the rest if it’s on the low.”

“yo, what parts you not feelin’, joe?” chimes mary jane, steppin’ in with susan right behind her. “it ain’t cool or kind for you to spit that at him—he’s a stranger, mad far from his crew. how would you feel if someone dissed you like that?”

“man, that’s just your jam, maim—always jumpin’ in to help someone before they get hurt. i didn’t do nothin’ bad to him. he might’ve been flexin’ some stretchers, i guess, but i straight up said i wasn’t gonna bite the whole bait; i kept it 100, every bit. bet he can handle a little shade, right?”

“look, i don’t care if it was a minor drip or a heavy downpour; he’s here in our crib and a stranger, and it was straight-up uncool for you to drop that. if you were in his kicks, you’d be shook and ashamed—so don’t go sayin’ things that make someone feel that way.”

“but, mam, he was like—”

“nah, it don’t matter what he said—that ain’t the point. the real flex is treatin’ him right and not draggin’ up how he ain’t on home turf with his own crew.”

i whispered to myself, yo, this girl is gettin’ jacked by that crusty old snake snatchin’ her cash!

next, susan sashays in; and no cap, she totally gave hare-lip some major vibes straight outta the tomb!

i think to myself again, another chick gettin’ cruised off her money!

then mary jane takes her turn, all sweet and adorbs like always—that’s her signature move; but by the time she wrapped it, there wasn’t nearly a dime left for poor hare-lip. so she starts hollerin’.

“aight, then,” the other girls chirp, “just go snag his pardon.”

she pulled it off too; and damn, she nailed it. so beautiful it made the vibe pure, and i was low-key wishin’ i could drop a thousand caped fables on her, so she could do it again.

i was thinkin’, yo, another chick gettin’ jacked by his scam, and when she was done, they all cozied up to make me feel at home, like i was deep in the friend crew. i was hella bitter—so low-key mean—that i decided: i’m gonna give them that money, or i’m straight-up bustin’.

so then, i bounced off—to my bed, i mean, eventually. once i was solo, i started overthinkin’ the sitch. should i roll up to that private doc and spill the tea on these fraudsters? nah, that ain’t in the cards. he might snitch on who spilled the tea; then the king and the duke would come down on me hardcore. should i go and clue mary jane in? nah—I’m not about that life. her face would totally give it away, and they already got the loot, they'd scoot out and dip. if she called in backup, i'd be tangled up in the biz before it was even done, fr. no; there ain’t no safe move but one. i gotta swipe that cash somehow, in a way that don’t tip ‘em off. they got a dope setup here, and they won’t bail till they milk this fam and town for every last buck, so i’ll find a chance eventually. i’ll ghost with the cash and stash it; and later, when i’m cruisin’ down the river, i’ll drop mary jane a letter with the deets. but i better secure it tonight if i can—‘cause the doc might not be as chill as he acts; he could scare ‘em off for real.

so then, i think to myself, i’ll go scope out the rooms. upstairs, the hall was mad dark, but i scoped the duke’s room and started rummagin’ with my hands; then it hit me—it ain’t the king’s style to let anyone handle his money except himself—so i bounced over to his room and started riflin’ through there. but real talk, i couldn’t do squat without a candle, and striking one is a no-go, obviously. so i figured the alternative was to play spy and eavesdrop. right about then, i heard their footfalls comin’, and i was fixin’ to dive under the bed; i reached for it, but it wasn’t where i expected. i ended up clutchin’ the curtain hidin’ mary jane’s frocks, so i dove behind it, nestled among the gowns, and froze like a straight-up statue.

they roll in and slam the door; and the duke, no cap, is the first to check under the bed. then i was super relieved i didn’t have to jump in there. though, i mean, it’s natural to hide under a bed when you’re plotin’ shady biz. they sat down, and the king goes:

“alright, what’s the move? and keep it snappy, ‘cause it’s way better to be down there whoppin’ up the mourning than givin’ ‘em a chance to come at us.”

“yo, here’s the sitch, capet. i ain’t feelin’ chill; i’m hella uneasy. that doc’s been heavy on my mind. i wanna know yo’ plans. i got a notion, and trust me—it’s sound.”

“spill it, duke—what’s the move?”

“i say we bounce outta here before like three in the morning, and dip down the river with what we’ve got. especially since it’s coming back to us—basically tossed at our door when we had to swipe it back. i’m all about ghostin’ and bouncin’ out.”

that hit me in the feels, bruh. like, an hour or two ago, i might’ve been on board, but now i was just bummed and disappointed. then the king snaps and goes:

“what! and we ain’t flippin’ the rest of the property? march off like a bunch of fools and leave eight or nine grand worth of property just chillin’, ready to be scooped up?—and it’s all primo, sale-ready swag too.”

the duke grumbles low-key; he reckons that bag of gold is enough, and he ain’t tryna dive deeper—ain’t about robbin’ a whole lot from orphans of their entire stash.

“damn, look how you talk!” the king fires back. “we ain’t robbin’ ‘em of anything but this cash. the buyers for that property are the suckers; ‘cause once it’s discovered we didn’t even own it—which won’t be long after we dip—the sale goes bust and it all goes back to the estate. these orphans will get their crib back, and that’s plenty; they’re young, agile, and can hustle up a livin’. they ain’t gonna suffer. just think—there’re thousands who ain’t rollin’ in dough. seriously, they got nothing to complain about.”

yo, the king went on a nonstop rant; so finally he caved, sayin’ alright, but mentioned it was straight-up foolishness to stick around with that doc hangin’ over us. then the king goes:

“to hell with the doc! why do we even need him? ain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? that’s more than enough majorities anywhere, trust.”

so they got ready to bounce downstairs again, and the duke says:

“yo, i don’t think we stashed that cash in the best spot.”

that lit me up, real talk. i was trippin’, thinkin’ i wasn’t gonna catch a single clue to help me out. then the king asks:

“why?”

“‘cause mary jane’s gonna be in full mourning mode over this; and sooner or later, the nay nay who handles the rooms will get hit with an order to box up these losers and stash ‘em away; and you think a nay nay can spot cash and not swipe a bit of it?”

“your head’s back on track, duke,” says the king, fumbling in under the curtain a couple feet from where i was. i stuck tight to the wall, super still even though i was shakin’, wonderin’ what these dudes would say if they caught me—and thinkin’ hard about what i’d do if that happened. but the king grabbed the bag before i could even think a half-thought, with zero suspicion that i was lurkin’. they stuffed the bag through a rip in the straw tick under the feather-bed, jammin’ it in about a foot or two of straw, and declared it all set—‘cause a nay nay only handles the feather-bed and only flips the straw tick like twice a year, so it wasn’t in any real danger of gettin’ jacked.

but yo, i knew better. i jetted that bag out before they even hit halfway downstairs. i fumbled my way to my cubby and stashed it until i could score a better hide. figured i’d even move it outside the crib somewhere, ‘cause if they missed it, they’d tear the place up for sure—and i knew that from way back. then i crashed for the night, still cladded up; but sleep was not an option, i was sweatin’ bullets to wrap this biz up. before long, i heard the king and duke roll back up; so i slid off my pallet, leaned my chin on top of my ladder, and waited on action. but nada went down.

so i stuck it out until all the late-night noise died and the early mornin’ vibes hadn’t kicked in; then i slipped down the ladder.
