chapter the last

yo, the first time i pulled tom aside on the low, i asked him: what's the plan, bruh? like, what's the move if our escape hustle actually goes off and we pull off freein' a nay nay who was technically free all along? and he was like, from day one, my head was set on this move: if we can get jim out all safe, we take him on a wild cruise down the river on our raft, go on epic adventures all the way to the river's mouth, then drop the bomb on him that he's free; scoop him back home on a steamboat, drippin' in style, pay him for his lost time, send word ahead, clear out all the nay nays around, and then have them parading him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band hype parade, makin' him a straight-up hero—and so would we. but honestly, i figured it was chill just the way it went down.

we got jim out of his chains in a hot minute, and when aunty sally, aunty polly, and uncle silas peeped how dope he was helpin' out doctor nurse tom, they went off on him, fussin' like mad, hooked him up prime, fed him all the bomb eats, gave him a killer time, and left him with nothin' to do. then we hauled him up to the sick-room for a deep vibe session; and tom dropped forty bucks on jim for bein' our super patient cellmate and handling it all like a boss, and jim was hella hyped—he busted out hella excited and goes:

"yo, huck, lemme drop some truth: what i laid out for you on jackson islan' was real. i told you, i had that wild grind goin' on, that unmistakable vibe that said i was rich once and was about to be rich af again; and guess what—it came through, for real! so now, don't front with me—facts are facts, my dude; i knew straight up that i was on track to be rich again as i stand here right now!"

then tom kept on spittin', goin' like, "yo, let's squad up—the three of us—and bounce outta here one of these nights, grab the gear, and head out for wild, howlin' adventures among the injuns over in the territory for a week or two;" and i was like, "bet, i'm down, but i ain't got cash to cop the gear, and i doubt i can snag any from home, cuz your pap's probably already slid back, scooped up all the dough from judge thatcher, and got wasted on it."

"nah, he ain't," tom fires back; "all that coin is still there—like six thousand dollars and then some; and your pap hasn't ever bounced back since, not even when i dipped."

jim goes all solemn:

"he ain't comin' back no more, huck."

i ask, "why, jim?"

jim shrugs, "idk, huck—but he ain't comin' back, period."

but i pressed on, so eventually he goes:

"yo, you remember that house floatin' down the river, with that dude all twisted up inside, and i rolled in, straight-up untwisted him, and kept you out? well, then, you can grab your cash whenever, cuz that was him."

tom's hella chill now, rockin' a bullet 'round his neck like some watch-guard bling, always peepin' the time, so there's literally nothing else to drop, and i'm mad relieved 'bout it, cuz if i knew the hassle of writin' a whole book, i would've never touched it—and i'm not about to do it again. but yo, i figure i gotta bounce for the territory ahead of the game, 'cause aunty sally's tryna adopt me and turn me all civilized, and i seriously can't vibe with that. i've been there before.

the end. yours truly, huck finn.
