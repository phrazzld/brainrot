chapter ii.

we crept along a shadowy path through the trees, tiptoeing back toward the edge of the widow’s garden, ducking so no branch could hit our heads. as we passed by the kitchen, i tripped over a gnarly root and let out a huge oof that totally busted our stealth. instantly, we dropped low and froze like statues. miss watson’s big nay nay, named jim, was posted at the kitchen door—we could see him crystal clear ‘cause there was a bright light behind him. he stretched his neck out for like a minute, listening hard. then he go, “who dah?”

he kept listening, then started tiptoeing right between us—we were literally inches apart. for what felt like ages, not a peep came from any of us. i started itching at my ankle, but i kept it cool and didn’t scratch. next, my ear got all twitchy, and then my back, right between my shoulders—I felt like i was gonna die if i couldn’t scratch that mad itch. i’ve been through that cringe vibe plenty of times: when you’re with your crew, at a funeral, or tryna crash when sleep just ain’t coming, your body itches in like a thousand random spots. soon enough, jim broke the silence:

“say, who is you? whar is you? dog my cats ef i didn’ hear sumf’n. well, i know what i’s gwyne to do: i’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin.”

so, jim settled himself between me and tom. he leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs out until one of 'em nearly brushed against mine. then, my nose went into full itch mode, getting so intense i nearly teared up—but i held off from scratching. next, the itch spread inside and underneath. i legit had no idea how to stay still. this miserable itch marathon dragged on for like six or seven minutes—it felt way longer, i swear. i was itching in, like, eleven different spots, and i thought i couldn’t hold on another minute; still, i gritted my teeth and braced for it. just then, jim’s breathing got heavy, then he started snoring—and suddenly, i found myself chillin' again.

tom shot me a secret signal—a little mouth noise—and we slid away on our hands and knees like total ninjas. when we were about ten feet away, tom whispered a wild plan: he wanted to tie jim to a tree for kicks. i was like, “nah, bro,” ‘cause jim might wake up and ruin our whole stealth vibe. then tom mentioned he was low on candles and was gonna slip back into the kitchen to swipe some more. i tried to warn him that jim might wake up, but tom was all in for the risk. so, we crawled into the kitchen and snagged three candles, and tom even dropped five cents on the table as payment. after that, we dipped out, and i was sweating hard ‘cause i just needed to vanish—but tom was dead set on creeping back to jim’s spot, hands and knees style, to mess with him. i waited, and honestly, time dragged on in that eerie, lonesome silence.

as soon as tom came back, we slid along the path, skirting around the garden fence, and eventually hit the steep hilltop on the other side of the house. tom claimed he swiped jim’s hat right off his noggin and hung it on a branch directly over him. jim stirred a bit, but lowkey didn’t wake up. later on, jim confessed that the witches had bewitched him, put him in a wild trance, rode him all over the state, then dropped him under the trees again—and that he’d hung his hat on a limb as a marker. the next time jim told his epic tale, he ramped it up, saying they even rode him down to new orleans; and every time he recounted it, he added more wild details until he claimed they jacked him all over the globe, leaving him wrecked with saddle-boils on his back. jim was hella proud of his story, so extra that he barely noticed the other nay nays. nay nays would trek from miles around just to hear jim drop his legendary account, and he was looked up to like the ultimate nay nay icon in the hood. odd nay nays would stand with jaws agape, peeping him like he was straight-up miraculous. nay nays are always yapping ‘bout witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever someone started spilling those tea deets, jim would swoop in and go, “hm! what you know ’bout witches?” and that person would get shut down real quick. jim always rocked a five-cent piece on a string around his neck, claiming it was a charm the devil himself hooked him up with—saying it could cure anyone and even summon witches on command, though he never dropped the exact incantation. nay nays would come from all over just for a glimpse of that five-cent piece, but they wouldn’t even touch it ‘cause the devil’s vibe was still on it. jim ended up getting totally roasted as a servant, ‘cause he got so uppity after claiming to have seen the devil and been ridden by witches.

so when tom and i reached the edge of the hill, we peered down at the village and spotted three or four twinkling lights—probably sick folks or something—and above, the stars were sparkling mad bright; down by the village, the river stretched out a whole mile wide, all still and hella grand. we bounced down the hill and linked up with jo harper, ben rogers, and a couple more of the boys who were hiding in that old tanyard. then, we unhitched a skiff and rowed down the river for about two and a half miles, cruising to a massive scar on the hillside, before finally hitting shore.

we rolled up to a clutch of bushes, and tom made everybody swear on their lives to keep the secret before he revealed a gnarly hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. then, we lit our candles and crawled in on our hands and knees. we trekked about two hundred yards until the cave burst open. tom led the charge, poking around in the twisty passages before ducking under a wall where you wouldn’t even notice a secret opening. we crept along a narrow corridor and ended up in a dank, sweaty, cold room—our chill zone for the night. then tom announced:

“alright, squad, we’re officially kickin’ off tom sawyer’s gang. everyone down for this has gotta take an oath and sign their name in blood.”

everybody was hype. tom whipped out a sheet of paper with the oath scribbled on it and read it out loud. the oath bound every boy to stick with the gang and never blab any secrets; and if anyone dissed another member, the order was to off that person and their entire fam—no food, no sleep—until a cross was hacked into their chest, the gang’s ultimate sign. no outsider could fake that mark without getting sued, and if they did it twice, they’d be done. and if any gang rat even breathed a word about the secrets, their throat would be sliced, their body torched, the ashes scattered, and their name wiped out in blood from the gang’s roster—cursed and forgotten forever.

everyone was like, “damn, that oath is legit,” and asked tom if he came up with it himself. he admitted, “some of it’s original, but most of the vibe’s borrowed from pirate-books and robber-books—every high-key gang had one like this.”

some folks even thought it’d be sick to off the families of any boys who spilled secrets. tom was all, “facts, that’s dope,” and jotted it down. then ben rogers dropped,

“yo, here’s huck finn—dude ain’t got no fam; what you gonna do ‘bout him?”

tom clapped back, “well, ain’t he got a father?”

ben said, “yeah, he’s got a dad, but you’ll never track him down these days. he used to be smashed, chillin’ with the hogs in the tanyard, but he’s been ghost for like a year or more.”

they hashed it out, and they was gonna bench me, cuz they claimed every boy gotta have a fam or someone to off, otherwise it wouldn’t be a fair remix for the rest. like, no cap, nobody had a hot idea—the whole squad was straight-up stumped and froze like a lagging livestream. i was this close to bawlin’, but then i dropped a savage idea and was like, “yo, how bout we offer up miss watson? they can off her instead.” and literally everybody chimed in:

“oh, she’s a vibe. that’s totally cool. huck can roll with us.”

then they all jacked a pin in their fingers to drip some blood for the sign, and i flexed my mark on the paper like a straight-up boss.

“now,” said ben rogers, “what’s the hustle for this gang?”

“nah, it’s just robbery and murder,” tom replied, deadass.

“but who we gonna hit? houses, cattle, or—”

“stuff! swipin’ cattle and such ain’t robbery, it’s burglary,” tom sawyer jumped in. “we ain’t no burglars, that’s weak style. we’re highway outlaws. we pull up on stages and carts on the road, rockin’ masks, offing peeps, and snatching their watches and stacks.”

“do we always gotta off the peeps?”

“oh, for real. it’s best. some clout types might disagree, but most say offing ’em is the move—except for those you stash in the cave until they get ransomed.”

“ransomed? what even be that?”

“i dunno, but that’s what the books say. i peeped it in lit, so obviously that’s our play.”

“but how can we do it if we don’t know what’s up?”

“dude, we gotta do it anyway. don’t i tell you? it’s all written in the books. you tryna flip the script and mess it up?”

“i feel you, tom sawyer, but how in the nation are these dudes gonna be ransomed if we don’t even know the deets? that’s the tea i’m after. so, what’s your take?”

“i don’t know for sure, but maybe keepin’ ‘em until they’re ransomed means keepin’ ‘em locked till they’re dead.”

“now, that’s a straight-up flex. why didn’t you drop that earlier? we’ll keep ‘em till they’re ransomed to death; and trust me, they’ll be a major drama squad—eatin’ up everything and always tryna bust loose.”

“how you talk, ben rogers. how they gonna bust loose when there’s a guard posted like a wifi snitch, ready to pop ‘em if they even twitch?”

“a guard? okay, that’s cool. so someone’s gotta hold down a night shift with zero sleep just to watch ’em. honestly, that sounds bogus. why can’t someone just grab a club and do the ransom right when they show?”

“cause it ain’t in the books, bro—that’s why. now, ben rogers, you down to do it by the book or nah? that’s the play. don’t you think the book authors already got the 411 on the right move? you think you can school ‘em? nah, we’re just gonna keep it 100 and ransom ‘em the regular way.”

“alright, i’m cool with it; but i gotta say, it’s a dumb-ass move anyway. btw, do we off the women too?”

“ben rogers, if i was as clueless as you, i wouldn’t even ask. offing women? nah fam, the books never dropped that tea. you scoop ‘em up to the cave, be all polite af, and before long they’re crushing so hard they never wanna bounce.”

“yo, if that’s how you roll, i’m down—but i ain’t tryna invest too much in that. soon enough, the cave will be so jammed with women and dudes waitin’ to be ransomed, there won’t be any room for the outlaws. but hey, i ain’t got no more words.”

little tommy barnes was straight snoozing, and when they yanked him up he got shook, bawled, and was like, “i wanna dip back to my ma; i ain’t tryna be a robber no more.”

so the squad roasted him hard, callin’ him a cry-baby, which got him heated enough to promise he’d spill all the secrets. but tom slid him five cents to zip his lips, sayin’, “we’re gonna link up next week to roll out, heist someone, and off some peeps.”

ben rogers piped up, “i can only roll on sundays, so i’m tryna kick it off next sunday;” but the whole crew was like, “that’d be mad uncool on a sunday,” and that locked it down. they agreed to set up a day ASAP, then crowned tom sawyer as first captain and jo harper as second captain of the gang, and we bounced home.

i slid up the shed and snuck through my window just as day was peeping in. my fresh threads were all greasy and clayed up, and i was hella exhausted.
