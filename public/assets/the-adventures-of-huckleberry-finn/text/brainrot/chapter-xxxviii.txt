chapter xxxviii.

making them pens was a hella rough grind, and the saw was no picnic either; and jim was all, the inscription was gonna be the hardest part of all. that’s the one a prisoner has gotta tag on the wall. but he had to flex it—tom was like, “bro, you gotta do it,” ‘cause there’s never been a state prisoner who didn’t leave behind his own epic inscription and coat of arms.

“check lady jane grey,” tom spits, “peep gilford dudley; scope out old northumberland! yo, huck, you think this is a major hassle? what you gonna do? how you gonna work around it? jim’s gotta tag his inscription and rock his coat of arms—every single one does, facts.”

jim goes, “yo, mars tom, i ain’t got no coat o’ arms; i ain’t got nothin’ but this crusty old shirt, and you know i gotta keep my journal on deck.”

“yo, you don’t get it, jim; a coat o’ arms is a whole different vibe.”

“well,” i reply, “jim’s facts, fr—he ain’t got a coat o’ arms ‘cause he legit doesn’t.”

“i lowkey knew that,” tom adds, “but bet he’ll snag one before he bounces from here—’cause he’s hustlin’ right, and there’ll be zero flops in his record.”

so while jim and i were grinding away on our pens—jim crafting his outta brass and i from a spoon—tom got busy plotting the coat o’ arms. after a minute he was like, “yo, i got so many dope designs, i can’t even pick one, but i’m feelin’ this one vibe.” and he goes:

“on the scutcheon, we gonna rock a bend in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, as the common charge, and under his foot a chain all embattled for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nay nay, sable, with his bundle slung over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which represent you and me; motto, maggiore fretta, minore atto—snagged straight from a book, meaning ‘the more haste, the less speed.’”

“geewhillikins,” i burst, “but like, what the heck do the rest even mean?”

“we ain’t got time to break that down,” tom snaps; “we gotta dive in full send, no cap.”

“anyways,” i go, “what even is a fess?”

“a fess—a fess is, like, not even important for you to know. i’ll school you on how to craft one when you hit that part.”

“damn, tom, you gotta spill the tea sometimes—what even is a bar sinister?”

“oh, i dunno, but it’s a must-have. all the big ballers in nobility rock it.”

that was just tom being tom. if he wasn’t feelin’ it to break it all down for you, he’d just ghost on the explanation—even if you pestered him for a week, he’d keep it 100.

tom had his coat o’ arms game locked down, so he hopped to finish the rest of the job: planning a sad af inscription—’cause jim had gotta have one just like everyone else. he whipped up a bunch, jotted ‘em on a scrap of paper, and rapped 'em out, like so:

1. here, a captive heart got totally wrecked.
2. here, a broke prisoner, ghosted by the world and his crew, steamed his sorrowed life.
3. here, a lonely heart got shattered, and a worn vibe dipped for good after thirty-seven years of solo captivity.
4. here, stranded and without squad, after thirty-seven years of bitter lockdown, perished a noble stranger—the natural offspring of louis xiv.

tom’s voice shook all over while spitting those lines, and he straight up lost it. when he finished, he couldn’t even pick which one jim should tag on the wall—they were all pure fire; but eventually, he was like, “yo, go ahead and tag ‘em all.” jim was like, “bro, it’d take me a year to nail all that crazy stuff into these logs with a nail, and i legit don’t even know how to craft letters,” but tom was like, “i gotchu—I’ll block it out for you so you just gotta trace the lines, easy peasy.”

then after a minute, tom goes, “yo, thinking it over, logs ain’t cutting it; there ain’t any log walls in a dungeon, bruh—we gotta carve these inscriptions into rock. let’s go snag a rock.”

jim was like, “dude, rock is even more brutal than logs; gonna take me, like, forever to chip these into stone so i never get out.” but tom was like, “chill, i’ll let you help.” then he peeped how jim and i were vibin’ with the pens. gotta say, it was hella annoying, tedious af, and super slow, leaving our hands all sore, and we barely made any progress—so tom goes:

“i got a hack, y’all. we need a rock for the coat o’ arms and for the sad inscriptions, so why not kill two birds with one stone? there’s this extra flashy grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smash it up, carve our dope designs on it, and even file our pens and the saw into it too.”

that idea was not a total flop, and that grindstone was no joke either; so we decided to roll with it. it wasn’t even midnight yet, so we dipped out to the mill, leaving jim on the grind. we smashed the grindstone up, then set out to roll it back home—but dang, it was a mega tough mission. sometimes, even with our best, we couldn’t keep it from toppling over, and it nearly mashed us every time. tom was like, “yo, one of y’all is gonna get wrecked before we finish,” for real. we got it halfway, then we were totally wiped, drenched in sweat. it was clear we had to go fetch jim. so he hoisted his bed, slid the chain off the bed-leg, looped it around his neck, and we crawled out through our escape hole down there, while jim and i took over that grindstone like bosses—with tom superintending like a straight-up legend who knew how to do everything, no cap.

our escape hole was pretty lit, but it wasn’t big enough to roll the grindstone through; so jim grabbed a pick and soon expanded it enough. then tom marked out the design on it with a nail and set jim to work carving, using the nail as a chisel and an iron bolt from the scrap in the lean-to as his hammer, and told him to grind it out till his candle totally dripped away, then he could bounce to bed, stash the grindstone under his straw tick, and crash. afterwards, we helped him fix the chain back on the bed-leg, and we were set for the night. then tom drops, “yo, you got any spiders in here, jim?”

“nah, sah, thank god i ain’t got none,” jim shot back.

“alright, we’ll grab you some.”

“but seriously, bro, i don’t want any. i’m straight-up scared of 'em; i swear, they'd have rattlesnakes lurking around soon enough.”

tom paused for a hot sec, then goes, “yo, that's a solid idea. and i bet it's been done before—it makes total sense. yeah, it's a prime move. where would you even stash it?”

“stash what, mars tom?”

“dude, a rattlesnake.”

“omg, mars tom! like, if a rattlesnake crawled in here, i’d smack it right out that log wall with my head, no cap.”

“yo, jim, trust me, you wouldn’t be shook for long—you could totally tame that beast.”

“tame it!”

“yeah—real simple. every creature vibes with kindness and petting, so they wouldn’t burn someone who’s givin’ them love. any book out there says that. just try—it’s all i ask; try for two or three days. soon enough, you'll have it so chill it’ll be your bae; it’ll sleep with you, never ghost you, and even let you wrap it around your neck and, i dunno, put its head in your mouth.”

“plz, mars tom—don’t go like that! i can’t even deal! if it ended up letting me shove its head in my mouth, wouldn’t that be hella weird? i bet it’d wait forever before i even ask. plus, i seriously don’t want it crashing with me.”

“jim, don’t be trippin'. a prisoner gotta have some whack pet, and if no one’s ever tried a rattlesnake, you’d be pioneering major glory—way more lit than any other trick to boost your survival game.”

“yo, mars tom, i’m not about that glory. if that snake bites my chin clean off, where’s the flex then? i ain’t down for that drama.”

“come on, why not give it a shot? i just want you to try—it doesn’t have to be forever if it flops.”

“but dude, if that snake bites me while i’m trying, man, that’s a whole other level of trouble. mars tom, i’m down for almost anything, but if you and huck bring a rattlesnake in here for me to tame, i’m straight bailing, no cap.”

“alright, then, if you’re that stubborn, let it slide. we can hook you up with some garter snakes instead—tie some buttons on their tails, pretend they’re rattlesnakes—and that’ll just have to do.”

“i don’t even stan those, mars tom, but if i can’t roll without ‘em, then i’m screwed. i never knew being a prisoner would be such a hassle and a whole lot of drama.”

“yo, it’s always wild when it’s done proper. you got any rats around here?”

“nah, sah, i haven’t peeped any.”

“alright, we’ll hook you up with some rats.”

“yo, mars tom, i ain’t about rats. they’re the most cringe creatures—always tryna mess with you, bump around, and chomp your feet when you’re just tryin’ to sleep, no cap. nah, if i gotta have one, give me garter snakes, but don’t hit me with rats; i got zero use for 'em, seriously.”

“but jim, you gotta have ‘em—they’re a staple. so quit the side-eye. every prisoner’s got rats; like, there isn’t a single case otherwise. they even train 'em, pet 'em, and teach 'em tricks—they get as chill as flies. but you gotta set the mood with music. you got anything to jam on?”

“i ain’t got much besides a coarse comb, a scrap of paper, and a juice-harp; but i doubt anyone would vibe with a juice-harp, tbh.”

“nah, they would. they don’t care what music is playin’. a jews-harp’s plenty fire for a rat. all animals, even locked up ones, straight up love music—they’re all about it, especially raw, pained vibes; and you can’t even bust any other tune from a jews-harp. it always pulls ‘em in—they’ll come out to see what’s up with you. trust, you’re on point; set up your bed sessions a few nights before sleep and first thing in the mornin’, and jam out on that jews-harp; play “the last link is broken”—that track will scoop rats faster than anything else; and after like two minutes, you’ll see all the rats, snakes, spiders, and whatever get all jittery ‘bout you and swarm over like nobody’s business.”

“facts, they will, i guess, mars tom, but what time is jim even on? damn, i can’t peep the clock. but i’ll do it if i gotta—i better keep these critters hyped so there’s no drama in the crib.”

tom chilled for a minute to think it over, then goes, “oh, btw, i forgot one thing. you reckon you could grow a flower here?”

“i dunno, maybe i could, mars tom; but it’s mad dark in here, and i got zero use for a flower, plus it’d be a total hassle.”

“aight, just try it anyway. some other prisoners have pulled that off.”

“one of those big cat-tail lookin’ mullen stalks would probably pop up here, mars tom, but it wouldn’t be nearly the drama it’d cause, no cap.”

“believe it. we’ll snag you a lil one, have you plant it in the corner over there, and watch it grow. and don’t call it mullen—call it pitchiola, that’s its legit prison name. and yo, you gotta water it with your tears.”

“yo, i got tons of spring water, mars tom.”

“nah, you don’t want spring water; you gotta water it with your tears—that’s just how it’s always done.”

“man, mars tom, i swear i could raise one of those mullen stalks just fine with spring water while somebody else is busy starting one with tears.”

“that ain’t the move. you gotta do it with tears, period.”

“she’ll straight up die on my account, mars tom, no cap; 'cause i literally never cry, fr.”

so tom was totally stumped. he mulled it over and then said jim would just have to deal with an onion instead. he promised he’d hit up the nay nay cabins and drop one lowkey in jim’s coffee-pot in the morning. jim was like, “i’ll just have my coffee all mixed up,” and ended up finding tons of issues with it—and with the whole hassle of raising the mullen, playing jews-harp for the rats, petting and hyping up the snakes and spiders, on top of all the other grind with pens, inscriptions, journals, and whatnot, making being a prisoner the ultimate mega grind of worry and responsibility—so tom straight lost his chill, saying jim was loaded down with more flashy chances to flex his name than any prisoner ever gets, yet he couldn’t even appreciate 'em. jim felt bad and promised not to act that way again, and then tom and i peaced out for bed.
