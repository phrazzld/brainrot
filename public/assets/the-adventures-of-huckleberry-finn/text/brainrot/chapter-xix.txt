chapter xix.

two or three days and nights flipped by; i swear they glided past, all smooth and chill. here’s how we kicked it: de river down there was beast-mode big—sometimes a mile and a half wide. we’d run at night and bunk up, layin’ low during de day; as soon as de night hit its lowest, we’d stop cruisin’ and tie up—almost always in de dead water under a tow-head—and then hack up some young cottonwoods and willows to cloak our raft. once de lines were set, we’d slide back into de river for a quick swim to freshen up and cool off; then we’d settle on de sandy bottom where de water was knee-deep and watch de sunrise. not a single peep anywhere—just dead silence, like de whole world was catchin’ zzz’s, except for the random clamor of bullfrogs. lookin’ out over de water, the first thing you’d peep is a dull line—that’s de woods on de other side; you couldn’t suss much else; then a pale patch in de sky, then more paleness spreadin’ out; de river softened too, switchin’ from black to gray; you’d spot tiny dark specks driftin’ on de horizon—trading scows and whatnot—and long black streaks that were rafts; sometimes you’d catch a sweep screeching, or hear jumbled voices echo from far off; and then, eventually, you’d see a streak on de water that tells you there’s a snag in a swift current breakin’ on it, creatin’ that look; then de mist would curl off de water, de east would redden up, and you’d make out a log cabin at de edge of de woods on de far bank—probably a woodyard piled high by some shady cheats so you could toss a dog through it anywhere; then a sweet breeze would pop up, fanning you over from de other side, so cool, fresh, and mad sweet ‘cause of de woods and flowers—though sometimes it stank ‘cause dead fish and gars were left layin’ around, gettin’ pretty rank; and then de full day hit, with everything lit up, smilin’ in de sun while the songbirds kept their jams goin’.

there wasn’t even a wisp of smoke, so we’d snag some fish off our lines and whip up a hot breakfast. afterwards, we’d just vibe and watch de lonely river, chillin’ until we eventually crashed. wakin’ up later, we’d scope out de scene—maybe catch a steamboat coughin’ its way upstream, so far on de other side you couldn’t really tell if it was stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour, it was just pure solitude. next, you’d spot a raft glidin’ by far off, maybe with a dude on it hackin’ away—’cause that’s de usual raft life; you’d see an axe flash and drop—you wouldn’t even hear it—and then, as that axe swung back up, you’d finally hear a big ol’ k’chunk! that sound took all de time to travel over de water. so we coasted through de day, maxin’ out and listenin’ to de stillness. one time, de fog got so thick, and de rafts and whatever slid by bangin’ tin pans so steamboats wouldn’t run into ‘em. one scow or raft passed so close we could hear them talk, curse, and laugh—plain as day—even though we couldn’t spot 'em; it gave you major creeps, like spirits were floatin’ in de air. jim was like, "i reckon it’s spirits," but i was like, "nah; spirits wouldn’t be sayin’, 'dern the dern fog.'"

as soon as night hit, we bounced; once we got de raft out to roughly de middle, we chilled, lettin’ it drift wherever de current took it. then we fired up our pipes, dangled our legs in de water, and jammed on about all sorts of wild topics—we were always streakin’ day and night if de mosquitoes didn’t be wreckin’ our vibe. the fresh threads buck’s fam made for me were too lit to be comfy anyway, and i’ve never been much about clothes.

sometimes, we had de entire river all to ourselves for what felt like forever. out yonder were de banks and islands on de far side, and sometimes you’d catch a little spark—a candle glow in a cabin window; and sometimes, on de water, you could spot a spark or two—on a raft or a scow—and maybe even hear a fiddle or a tune driftin’ from one of de crafts. livin’ on a raft is straight-up bliss. we had de whole sky above, speckled with stars, and we’d just lie back and debate whether they were handcrafted or just happened. jim was all, "they were made," but i was like, "nah, they just happened"—‘cause, seriously, it’d take forever to make that many. jim even said de moon coulda laid ‘em; that sounded kinda on point, ‘cause i’ve seen a frog lay nearly as many, so why not? we even watched de fallin’ stars streak down—jim swore they got wrecked and bailed outta de nest.

once or twice a night, we’d peep a steamboat glidin’ through de dark, and every now and then, it’d belch a shower of sparks from its smokestacks, rainin’ down on de river like pure art; then it’d round a corner, its lights winking out and its whole vibe droppin’, leavin’ de river dead silent again; and later, its waves would hit us long after it was gone, givin’ our raft a little jiggle, then silence would reign for who knows how long—maybe only interrupted by some croakin’ frogs.

after midnight, de folks on shore crashed, and for a solid two or three hours, de banks were pitch black—no more cabin-window sparks. those sparks were our clock; when de first one popped back up, it meant dawn was close, so we scouted a spot to hide and tie up ASAP.

one morning ‘round daybreak, i spotted a canoe and crossed over a chute to de main shore—only like two hundred yards—and paddled about a mile up a crick through cypress woods to snag some berries. as i cruised past a spot where a cowpath crossed de crick, outta nowhere a couple of dudes came tearin’ up de path, full send. i thought i was done for—‘cause whenever someone was chasin’ someone, i figured it was me or maybe jim. i was about to dip real quick, but they got so close they started yellin’ and beggin’ me to save their lives—swearin’ they hadn’t done nothin’ and were bein’ chased by dudes and dogs. they were ready to jump in, but i was like, "don’t do it. i ain’t hearin’ no dogs or hooves yet; you got time to hustle through de brush, get up de crick a bit, then hit de water, wade on over to me, and jump in—that’ll totally throw de dogs off de scent."

they did as i said, and as soon as they were aboard, i high-tailed it for our tow-head. in about five or ten minutes, we could hear de dogs and dudes hollerin’ off in de distance. we heard ‘em creepin’ toward de crick, but couldn’t see a damn thing; they messed around for a while, and as we got further away, we barely heard ‘em at all. by the time we left a mile of woods behind and hit de river proper, it was dead silent, so we paddled over to de tow-head, bunked in de cottonwoods, and were safe.

one of these dudes was like seventy or more, rockin’ a bald dome with mad gray whiskers. he had on a beat-up slouch hat, a greasy blue wool shirt, and ragged blue jean britches tucked into his boot-tops, plus a homemade gallus—nah, just one—and an old long-tailed blue jean coat with slick brass buttons draped over his arm. both he and his partner lugged around huge, fat, ratty carpet-bags. the other dude was about thirty, dressed all ornery. after breakfast, we all chilled and started chattin’, and the first thing that came up was that these guys didn’t even know each other.

"what got you into this mess?" the baldhead asks de other chap.

yo, so here’s the tea: i was hustlin’ this miracle gadget that scrapes off that nasty tartar from your chompers—and yeah, it even yeets the enamel too, no cap—but i ended up crashing for an extra night than i should’ve and was just about to dip when i bumped into you on the trail on this side of town. you dropped the bomb that they were coming in hot and straight-up begged for my help to bounce. so i was like, “ngl, i was already expecting mad drama, so imma split with you.” that’s the full deets—what’s your story?

so check it: i was running this hype temperance revival gig for about a week, and i was literally the fave among all the ladies—big and small—‘cause i was turning up the heat for the rummies, raking in like five or six bucks a night (ten cents a head, kiddos and nay nays free), and biz was boomin’ nonstop. then, outta nowhere, word got around last night that i had this sneaky habit of clocking in some private jug time on the low. a nay nay straight-up woke me this morning and said the squad was lowkey gathering with their dogs and horses, and they’d roll through in about half an hour to run me down—and if they caught me they’d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, for real. so i bailed on breakfast—i wasn’t even hungry, no cap.

“yo, old man,” the youngin piped up, “imma bet we could squad up on this hustle together; what’s your take?”

i ain’t shut down on that, my guy. so, what’s your main hustle?

“i’m a jour printer by trade, dippin’ into patent meds on the side; a theater actor, rockin’ those tragic vibes, ya know; i also dabble in mesmerism and phrenology whenever the chance pops off; i even school kids in singing-geography sometimes; and i might drop a lecture every now and then—i do a million things, so none of it feels like work. what’s your gig?”

“man, i’ve done a solid amount of doctoring in my day. laying on o’ hands is my signature move—i can smack down cancer and freeze paralysis like it’s nothing—and i can read a fortune pretty slick when i’ve got someone to spill the tea for me. i’m big on preachin’ too, doin’ camp meet-ups and goin’ on full missionary mode.”

there was dead silence for a minute; then the young buck let out a long, dramatic sigh and goes:

“alas!”

“what are you even whining about?” says the baldhead.

“i can’t even with it—i mean, who’d have thought i’d end up livin’ this cray life and get dragged down to roll with this squad?” he grumbled, wiping the corner of his eye with a rag.

“seriously, bro, your vibe—ain’t this crew lit enough for you?” snaps the baldhead, all pert and uppish.

“yeah, it’s as lit as i deserve; i dragged myself down from those high heights. i ain’t throwing no shade at you dudes—nah, i ain’t blaming anyone. i earned every bit of this mess. let the cold, hard world do its worst; one thing’s for sure—there’s a grave waitin’ for my sorry self. the world may snatch away all the good stuff—friends, cash, everything—but it can’t steal that one thing. someday, i’ll just lie down in it, forget it all, and my shattered heart can finally catch a break.” he kept on wiping.

“bro, ease up on that busted heart,” says the baldhead, “why you spillin’ your raw feels all over us? we didn’t do nothin’, ya feel?”

“nah, i know you’re clean. i only dragged myself down—i did it all on my own. i deserve every bit of the pain, and i ain’t even moanin’ about it.”

“but yo, brought yourself down from where, exactly?”

“ah, you wouldn’t believe it; the world never vibes with the truth anyway—let it slide, it ain’t no biggie. the secret of my birth—”

“your birth secret? are you actually sayin’—”

“yo, gentlemen,” says the youngin, all solemn and intense, “i’m droppin’ this secret on y’all ‘cause i trust you. ngl, by legit right, i’m a duke!”

jim’s eyeballs went full glitch mode when he caught that—and i swear mine did too. then the baldhead goes, “no way! you can’t be serious?”

“facts. my great-grandpops—the eldest son of the duke of bridgewater—dipped out to this land near the end of the last century to breathe in that pure freedom vibe; he got hitched here and then passed, leavin’ behind a son (with his own dad dying around the same time). but then the second son of the late duke snatched up all the titles and estates, totally ghostin’ the legit infant duke. i’m the straight-up descendant of that baby duke—i’m the rightful duke of bridgewater; and here i am, abandoned, torn from that high-roller life, hunted by every lowlife, dissed by a cold, heartless world, lookin’ like a total wreck, and forced to kick it with a bunch of shady outlaws on a damn raft!”

jim was hella feelin’ him, and so was i. we tried to hype him up, but he was like, “nah, nothing will fix this mess except if i just peace out for good;” though he did admit it vibes him up a bit if folks treat him like royalty—gettin’ down on one knee, droppin’ a “your grace” or “my lord” when they speak, servin’ him first at meals, and never sittin’ down until he gives the nod. so jim and i got busy majestying him, runnin’ around doin’ this and that and stayin’ up until he said we could sit. that totally lifted his spirit, and he got way more upbeat and chill. but the duke started gettin’ salty at him and wasn’t feelin’ how things were goin’, while the king kept it super friendly, sayin’ that the duke’s great-grandpops and all the other dukes of bilgewater were mad respected by his dad and got major palace props; still, the duke remained in a huffy mood for a hot minute, until eventually the king said:

“like, for real, we gotta stick together for a long haul on this hella cramped raft, bilgewater, so why you trippin’ with all that sour energy? it’ll just make the vibes extra awkward. it ain’t on me that i wasn’t born a duke, and it ain’t on you that you weren’t born a king—so why sweat it? just roll with what you got, that’s my motto. we hit a pretty chill spot here—plenty of grub and an easy life—so c’mon, hook us up, duke, and let’s squad up as fam.”

the duke came through, and jim and i were mega stoked to see that. it killed all the awkward vibes and we felt hella good, ‘cause on a raft, any bad energy is a total disaster—the only thing you need is everyone chillin’ and vibin’ together.

i didn’t take long to peep that these clowns weren’t real kings or dukes at all—they were just low-down frauds and humbugs. but i kept it all on the down low and never threw shade; that’s the best way to avoid beef and drama. if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, cool with me, as long as it kept the peace; and there was zero point in spilling it to jim, so i zipped my lip. if i learned anything from pap, it was that the slickest way to roll with these types is to let them do their own thing.
