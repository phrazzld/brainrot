chapter vi.

ngl, it didn’t take long for pap to be up and hustling again, and then he went for judge thatcher in court to snatch that cash, and he even came after me for not showing up at school. he caught me a couple times and thrashed me, but i still hit school like a rebel, dodging or outrunning him most of the time. i wasn’t really about school before, but now i did it just to spite pap. that whole trial was mad slow—like they were never gonna start it—so every now and then, i’d borrow two or three bucks from the judge on pap’s behalf, just so i wouldn’t get a savage cowhide session. every time pap got money, he got smashed; every time he got smashed, he raised absolute hell in town; and every time he raised hell, he ended up getting locked up. this was totally his jam.

pap started hanging around the widow’s spot way too much, so she finally snapped and warned him that if he didn’t bounce, she’d stir up serious trouble. of course, he flipped out and declared he’d show everyone who was really in charge of huck finn. one spring day, he scoped me out, caught me, and dragged me up the river in a rickety skiff for about three miles, crossing over to the illinois shore where it was mad woody and there were zero proper houses—just some old log hut in a spot where the trees were so thick you’d be lost without a gps.

he kept me chained up with him 24/7, never giving me a chance to dip. we crashed in that ancient cabin where he always locked the door and stashed the key under his head every night. he had this janky stolen gun, i swear, and we lived off fish and game—real survival flex. every once in a while, he locked me in and bounced to the store three miles away for the ferry, trading our catch for whisky, then came back, got hella smashed, partied hard, and beat me up. before long, the widow caught on to where i was, sent some dude to scoop me up; but pap, armed with his gun, straight-up drove him off. eventually, i got so used to it i actually started digging the woods—well, every bit except the constant cowhiding.

it was mad chill and lazy—just laying low all day, smoking and fishing, with zero homework or reading. after a couple months, my clothes turned into straight-up rags and grime, and i couldn’t even process how much i loved this life compared to the widow’s proper routine—wash up, eat off plates, comb your hair, stick to a strict sleep schedule, and grind on books while old miss watson pecked at you nonstop. i never wanted to go back to that crampy, civilized scene. i even stopped cussing 'cause the widow was on that, but then pap didn’t give a damn so my swear game was back on. honestly, life in the woods was pretty lit overall.

but then, pap got way too trigger-happy with his hick’ry, and i ended up covered in welts. he started locking me in more and started disappearing for long stretches—one time, he locked me in and dipped for three whole days. it was mad lonely; i even thought he’d drowned and that i’d be stuck there forever. i got scared, so i decided i had to hatch an escape plan. i had tried busting out of that cabin a hundred times, but there was zero exit. the windows were so tiny even a dog couldn’t squeeze through, the ladder (that chimbly) was way too narrow, and the door was built like fortress-level oak slabs. pap was smart about not leaving any knives or tools behind, so i scoured the whole dump daily. but this time, i finally spotted an old rusty wood-saw missing its handle, tucked between a rafter and the roof clapboards. i greased that bad boy up and got to work. there was also an ancient horse-blanket nailed against the logs behind the table to block the wind from snuffing out the candle. i slid under the table, hoisted the blanket up, and started sawing a chunk out of the big bottom log—big enough for me to squeeze through. it was a brutal grind, but i was nearly done when i heard pap’s gun echo in the woods. i scrapped any sign of my work, dropped the blanket, hid the saw, and pretty soon, pap crashed back in.

pap wasn’t in a good mood—so true to his savage self. he ranted that downtown was a total mess and everything was falling apart. his lawyer was all, “i’ll win that lawsuit and snag the cash if we ever start the trial,” but judge thatcher had all the moves to drag it out forever. pap kept going, saying they were planning another trial to yank me away and hand me over to the widow as guardian, and that it’d definitely go his way this round. that shook me, ‘cause i seriously didn’t want to go back to that cramped, proper life. then pap went into full cuss mode, dropping every swear word he could think of, then re-dropping them to be extra sure he didn’t miss anyone—even calling a bunch of random peeps “what’s-his-name” as he ranted on.

he declared he’d love to see the widow scoop me up. he warned that if anyone tried to mess with him, he knew a spot six or seven miles out where he could hide me so tight that they’d hunt me down until they were totally beat and still couldn’t find me. that got my heart racing for a sec, but i figured i wouldn’t hang around long enough for him to pull that stunt.

pap then made me haul his stash from the skiff. there was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, a slab of bacon, some ammo, a four-gallon jug of whisky, an old book, two newspapers to use as wadding, and even some tow. i lugged it all up and crashed on the bow of the skiff to catch my breath. i mulled it over and decided i’d bounce—with the gun and some fishing lines—into the woods when it was time to dip. my plan was to never stick around one spot, just to roam cross-country mostly at night, hunting and fishing to survive, and get so far away that neither pap nor the widow could ever track me down. i figured i’d saw my way out and escape that very night if pap got dumb enough to get smashed—and i was sure he would. i got so lost in planning my exit that i didn’t notice the time until pap hollered, asking if i was asleep or, like, drowned.

i hauled everything up to the cabin, and soon it got dark. while i was cooking supper, pap took a swig or two, got all warmed up, and started ripping into another rant. he had been smashed in town and was lying in the gutter all night—looked like a total wreck, covered in mud, almost like he was adam himself—but all muddy. whenever his liquor kicked in, he always went off on the govment, and this time he roared:

“call this a govment! just peep at it and see what’s up. here’s the law, all set to snatch a man’s own son away—a son he busted his butt raising with all the stress and cash and anxiety. like, just as that dude finally raised his kid so he was ready to grind and make something of him, the law pops up and grabs him. and they call that govment! that ain’t all, either. the law cozies up to that old judge thatcher to help keep me from what’s mine. here’s the tea: the law takes a dude worth six grand or more and shoves him into a dump of a cabin like this, making him wander around in threads unfit for even a hog. they call that govment! a man can’t even claim his rights in a setup like this. sometimes, i seriously think about bouncing from the country for good. yeah, and i told that straight to old thatcher—right to his face. a bunch of folks heard me, and they know exactly what i said: for two cents, i’d peace out and never come near this cursed land again. i mean, check my hat—if you can even call it a hat—its lid pops up while the rest hangs below my chin, making it look like my head got jammed through a busted stove-pipe. peep it—i said, that’s one wicked hat for me to rock, enough to make me one of the richest dudes in town if i could just claim my rights.”

“oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. look here—there was a free nay nay from ohio, a mulatter, as white as a white man could be. he rocked the whitest shirt you ever did see and the shiniest hat; not a single dude in that town had clothes as fly as his. plus, he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the dopest old gray-headed nabob in the state. and get this, they said he was a p’fessor at a college, could spit in a million languages, and knew everything. and that ain’t even the worst part. they said he could vote from his crib. that got me hyped—i was like, what’s this country even become? it was election day, and i was about to roll up to vote, if i wasn’t too smashed; but when they told me there was a state where they’d let that nay nay vote, i bailed. i said, i’ll never vote again—those are the exact words i dropped, and everyone heard. and let me tell you, the country can rot—i’m never voting as long as i’m breathing. and check the slick-ass way that nay nay carried himself—he wouldn’t even give way if i hadn’t shoved him aside. i asked the people, why ain’t this nay nay put up at auction and sold? that’s what i wanna know. and what do you think they replied? they were like, “dude, he can’t be sold till he’s been in the state six months,” and he hadn’t even been there that long. boom—that’s a whole vibe. they call that a govment that can’t sell a free nay nay till he’s been in the state six months. here’s a govment that calls itself a govment, acts like one, thinks it is one, but still has to pause for six whole months before it can snatch a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nay nay, and—”

pap kept going on so hard in his drunk rant that he didn’t even notice his old wobbly legs taking him places. he tripped head over heels on a tub of salt pork and smashed his shins, and the rest of his speech was just a barrage of savage burns—mostly aimed at the nay nay and the govment, though he dissed the tub a bit here and there too. he hopped around the cabin like a busted pogo, first on one leg then the other, clutching one shin and then the other, and finally, outta nowhere, slammed his left foot for a rattling kick on the tub. but low-key, that wasn’t smart, ‘cause that boot was already leaking a couple of his toes out the front; so he let out a howl that made everyone’s hair stand on end, then tumbled down in the dirt, rolled around while clutching his hurt toes, and his avalanche of cussing that followed totally topped every rant he’d dropped before. he later said that was on par with what old sowberry hagan used to do in his prime—but ngl, i think he was just piling it on extra hard.

after supper, pap grabbed the jug like a boss and was all, “yo, i got mad whisky in here – enough to sauce two full-on drunks and one wild delirium tremens, no cap.” that was his forever flex. i was lowkey bettin’ he’d be so lit in like an hour that he’d be blind drunk, and then i’d swipe the key or peaced out, whichever was easiest. he kept guzzlin’ and guzzlin’, and eventually bonked out on his blankets; but luck wasn’t on my side, fr. pap didn’t hit that deep sleep mode – he was twitchy and anxious, moanin’ and floppin’ around like a glitchy livestream for a hot minute. eventually, i got so sleep-deprived i couldn’t even vibe with open eyes, and next thing i know, i’m straight up crashed and the candle was still burnin’.

i dunno how long i was out like that, but then – bam – an insane scream shattered the silence and i jolt up. pap was straight-up trippin’, hyper and hoppin’ around like he’d been hit with too many lag spikes, yellin’ about snakes, no cap. he kept sayin’ they were creepin’ up his legs; then outta nowhere he’d lurch and shriek like someone had just bit his cheek – but i couldn’t peep any snakes anywhere. he went off, sprintin’ circles around the cabin hollerin’, “yo, get him off! get him off! he’s gnawin’ on my neck!” i’ve never peeped a dude look so cray in his eyes. before long, he was totally wiped, collapsed, pantin’ his life away; then he started rolly-rolling on the floor, kickin’ stuff and flailin’ his arms at thin air, screamin’ that demons were on his tail. eventually, he burned out and chilled for a minute, moanin’ low-key. then he chilled even harder, not makin’ a peep. i could hear owls and wolves howlin’ in the woods – the vibe was straight-up spooky. he was sprawled out by the corner. after a bit, he jerked up a bit and tilted his head to one side like he was tryna catch a secret drop in the wind. he whispered, super low:

“tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re comin’ for me; but i ain’t goin’. oh, they’re here! don’t even touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re ice-cold; let go. oh, let a poor devil be, aight?”

then, get this, he dropped to all fours and started crawlin’ off, beggin’ like mad for them to leave him alone, then curled himself up in his blanket and went full drama under the old pine table, still beggin’ non-stop; eventually, he broke down and cried – i could even hear him cryin’ through the blanket.

not long after, he rolled out and sprang to his feet all cray, spotted me, and went full hunter mode. he chased me around like i was his next raid target, clutchin’ a clasp-knife and callin’ me the angel of death, swearin’ he was gonna off me so i couldn’t come after him no more. i pleaded, told him i was just huck, nothing more; but he let out this super screechy laugh, roared and dropped a bunch of salty curses, and kept sprintin’ after me. at one point, when i ducked and slid under his arm, he lunged and clutched my jacket between my shoulders – i legit thought it was game over; but i busted out of that jacket faster than a glitch in a speedrun, savin’ my skin. soon enough, pap was so tuckered out he slumped against the door, sayin’ he’d chill for a minute then off me. he jammed his knife under himself, declared he’d sleep to reload his strength, and then see who was boss.

so, he dozed off in a snap. meanwhile, i snagged that cracked-ass old chair and crept up as quiet as an offline stream, grabbed the gun, and slid the ramrod down to check – yup, it was loaded. i laid it across the turnip barrel, pointin’ it at pap, and chilled behind it waitin’ for him to stir. damn, time was draggin’ like a laggy server.
