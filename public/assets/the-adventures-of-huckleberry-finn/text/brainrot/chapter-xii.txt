chapter xii.

it was almost one o'clock when we finally cruised below the island, and the raft was moving mad slo-mo. if any boat popped up, we were ready to jump in the canoe and jet for the illinois shore; but for real, no boat came, 'cause we never even stocked the canoe with a gun, or a fishing line, or any grub. we were sweating so hard we barely had time to think. it just wasn't smart to put everything on the raft.

if those dudes went to the island, i figure they peeped the campfire i set up and waited all night for jim to roll up. anyway, they left us alone, and if my fire tactic didn't fool 'em, that's not on me. i kept it hella lowkey on 'em.

when the first glimmers of day showed, we tied up to a tow-head at a big bend on the illinois side, hacked off some cottonwood branches with our hatchet, and draped the raft with them so it looked like a cave-in had hit the bank. (a tow-head is basically a sandbar with cottonwoods packed as thick as harrow-teeth.)

we had mountains on the missouri shore and mad timber on the illinois side, and the channel was on the missouri shore at that spot, so we weren't stressing about anyone running into us. we chilled there all day, watching rafts and steamboats cruise down the missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fighting the big river in the middle. i spilled all the tea to jim about my convo with that woman; and jim was like, she’s smart—if she decided to come after us herself, she wouldn't just sit and watch a campfire. nah, she'd go snag a dog. then i was like, why doesn't she just tell her man to fetch a dog? jim guessed she probably had that on deck by the time the dudes were ready to roll, and he figured they must've dipped uptown to grab a dog, which lost them all that time—'cause otherwise, we'd be chillin' on that tow-head sixteen or seventeen miles below the village; no cap, we'd already be back in that same old town. so i was like, i don't care what excuse they come up with—as long as they don't catch us.

as dusk rolled in, we peeped out from the cottonwood thicket and scoped around—nothing in sight. so jim grabbed some of the top planks from the raft and whipped up a snug little wigwam to crash in when the weather got blazing or rainy, keeping our gear dry. jim even rigged up a floor for the wigwam, raising it a foot or more above the raft so that the blankets and traps stayed well out of reach from steamboat waves. dead center in the wigwam, we layered about five or six inches of dirt inside a frame to hold it in place; this was our secret fire pit for when the weather got sloppy or chilly, and the wigwam kept it hidden. we even rigged an extra steering-oar, just in case one of the others broke on a snag or somethin’. plus, we fixed up a short, forked stick to hang the old lantern on, 'cause we gotta light that lantern every time we spot a steamboat comin' downstream to avoid getting wrecked; but we wouldn’t have to light it for upstream boats unless we found ourselves in a so-called "crossing"—'cause the river was still pretty high and the low banks even a bit underwater, so upstream boats didn't always stick to the channel—they were on the hunt for the smooth water.

that second night, we cruised between seven and eight hours, with a current pushin' over four miles per hour. we copped some fish, shot some rusty banter, and even took a quick swim now and then to shake off the sleepiness. it was kinda solemn, driftin' down that big, chill river, laid back on our backs star-gazin', and we never felt like yappin' loud; we barely cracked a laugh—just a low, soft chuckle here and there. the weather was mad solid overall, and nothing crazy went down—not that night, nor the next, nor the one after.

every night, we rolled past towns—some chillin' way up on dark hillsides, lookin' like a shiny bed of lights with not a single house in sight. on the fifth night, we cruised by st. louis, and damn, it was like the whole world lit up. in st. petersburg, they used to say st. louis had like twenty or thirty thousand people, but i never bought it 'til i peeped that epic spread of lights at two o'clock that same night. it was dead quiet; everybody was straight up asleep.

every night after that, i used to slide ashore around ten o'clock at some little village and cop ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal, bacon, or whatever munchies—sometimes even snagging a chicken that wasn't roosting right, and taking it with me. pap always said, "grab a chicken when you get the chance, 'cause if you don't want it, you'll find someone else who does—and a good deed's never forgotten." i never saw pap pass on a chicken for himself, but that's just how he rolled.

mornings pre-dawn, i'd sneak into cornfields and jack a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some fresh corn—anything like that. pap always said it ain't harm in borrowing stuff if you intend to pay it back later; but the widow was like, nah, that's just a soft word for stealing, and no one decent would do that. jim was like, "yo, the widow's partly right and pap's partly right," so the best move was for us to cross off two or three items from the list and swear we won't borrow 'em anymore—then, borrowing the rest ain't no big deal. so we hashed it out one night, driftin' down the river, tryin' to decide whether to drop the watermelons, the cantaloupes, the mushmelons, or what. but by dawn, we settled and decided to drop the crabapples and p'simmons. we weren't feelin' 100% before that, but everything was chill after. i was mad glad with how it turned out, 'cause crabapples never hit different, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for like two or three months yet.

we even snapped a water-fowl every now and then—the ones that woke up way too early in the morning or crashed too late at night. all in all, we were livin' pretty high.

the fifth night below st. louis, after midnight, a savage storm hit—thunder, lightning, and rain pouring down like a solid sheet. we hunkered down in the wigwam and let the raft handle itself. when the lightning flashed, we could see a huge straight river ahead with massive, rocky bluffs on both sides. before long, i go, "hel-lo, jim, looky yonder!" and there it was—a steamboat that had totally wrecked itself on a rock. we were driftin' straight for it. the lightning made it super clear: the boat was hunching over, with part of its upper deck floatin' above the water, and every last detail was visible—the tiniest bits all clean and clear, plus a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hangin' off it when the flashes hit.

yo, with it bein' deep in the night, stormy and mad mysterious-like, i was feelin' all the feels—just like any other boy would when seein' that wreck laid out all sad and lonesome in the middle of the river. i was hyped to get aboard, sneak around a bit, and peep what was really goin' down. so i said,
"le's land on her, jim."

but jim was totally against it at first. he goes,
"i doan' want to go fool'n 'longer with no wreck. we's doin' fine, and we best leave wrecks alone, as the good book says. like, there’s probably a watchman on that wreck."

i snapped back,
"watchman your grandmother; there ain't nothing worth watchin' but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you really think anybody's gonna risk his life over a texas and a pilot-house on a night like this, when it's likely to break up and wash away down the river any minute?"

jim had nothing to say to that, so he kept quiet. "and besides," i go, "we might snag something valuable out of the captain's stateroom. seegars, i bet—cost five cents a pop, straight cash. steamboat captains are always stacked, pulling like sixty dollars a month, and they don't give a damn about the price, as long as they get what they want. stash a candle in your pocket; i can't chill, jim, until we rummage through her completely. you think tom sawyer would ever pass on this? not for pie, no way. he'd call it an adventure—that's his vibe; and he'd hop on that wreck if it was his last play. and wouldn't he go all out, throwin' mad style into it? like, you'd think christopher c'lumbus was discoverin' kingdom-come. damn, i wish tom sawyer was here."

jim grumbled a bit but eventually caved. he warned, "we ain't gonna jaw more than we gotta, and keep our voices super low." just then, the lightning lit the wreck again right on time, and we grabbed the stabboard derrick and secured it in place.

the deck out there was mad high. we snuck down its slope to the labboard in the dark, headed toward the texas, feelin' our way slow with our feet and spreadin' our hands to ward off any peeps, 'cause it was so dark we couldn't see a damn soul. soon enough, we hit the forward end of the skylight and clambered up; the very next step dropped us right in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by jimminy, down through the texas-hall we spotted a light! and in that same sec, we heard some low-key voices off in the distance!

jim whispered that he was feelin' mega sick and told me to stick close. i was like, "aight," and was 'bout to head back for the raft; but just then, i heard a voice wail out,
"oh, please don't, boys; i swear i won't ever spill the tea!"

another voice came in, loud as hell:
"it's a lie, jim turner. you've done this before. you always want more than your fair share of the goods, and you always get it, 'cause you swear that if you don't, you'll snitch. but this time, you've pushed it one time too many. you're the meanest, most treacherous hound in this country."

by then, jim had bounced for the raft. i was mad curious, thinkin' tom sawyer wouldn't bail now, so why should i? i was gonna see what the deal was. so i dropped down on all fours in that tiny passage and crept aft in the dark until there was only one stateroom between me and the texas cross-hall. then, i peeped a dude sprawled on the floor, all tied up hand and foot, with two other dudes standing over him—one clutching a dim lantern, and the other rockin' a pistol. the pistol dude kept pointin' it at the man's head and goin',
"i'd like to! and i orter, too—a mean skunk!"

the tied-up guy shriveled up and begged,
"oh, please don't, bill; i ain't ever gonna snitch."

each time he said that, the lantern dude cracked up and said,
"'deed you ain't! you never said a truer thing than that, no cap." and once he added, "hear him beg! and yet, if we hadn't tied him up, he'da straight killed us both. and for what? just for nothin'. just 'cause we stood our ground—that's the score. but i lay, you ain't gonna be threatenin' nobody no more, jim turner. drop that pistol, bill."

bill shot back,
"i don't wanna, jake packard. i'm all for snuffin' him—and didn't he off old hatfield just the same way—and ain't he earned it?"

"but i ain't tryna have him dead, and i got my reasons, yo."

"bless yo' heart for that, jake packard! i’ll never forget you as long as i'm breathin'!" the tied-up man slurred, kinda bawlin'.

packard didn’t even lose a vibe over that, he straight-up hung his lantern on a nail and set off toward my dark spot while signaling bill to dip in. i scrambled as fast as i could for like two yards, but the boat was all tilt-mode so my pace was sus; to avoid getting clapped and snatched, i slid into a stateroom on the upper side.

the dude crept through the dark like a stealthy prowler, and when packard rolled up to my stateroom he was like, "here—come in here." so off he bounced, with bill trailing close behind. but before they could slide in, i was already stuck up in the top bunk, cornered and lowkey regretting it. they then chilled there with their hands on the bunk’s ledge, deep in convo. i couldn’t peep them, but i totally knew the vibe from the whisky buzz they were on. ngl, i was stoked i skipped the whisky; though honestly, it wouldn’t have flipped the script much ‘cause most times they couldn’t even clock me since i wasn’t even vibing a proper breath. i was straight-up shook. besides, you just can’t breathe and catch all that tea.

they were whispering low and serious. bill was on a murder mission against turner. he goes, "he’s been promising to snitch, and no cap, he will. if we handed over all our shares to him right now, it wouldn’t change a damn thing after the drama and how we played him. tbh, from the jump he was gonna flip and be state evidence; now listen up, i’m all about cutting his troubles off for good."

"same here," packard muttered, deadpan.

"bruh, i kinda figured you weren’t down—but all good. let's yeet into action."

"hold up a sec; i ain’t dropped my two cents yet. listen, shooting’s cool and all, but there are way stealthier moves if the job’s gotta be done. here’s my two cents: it ain’t smart to go all in chasing a dude with a hangman’s noose when you can quietly handle your biz without extra heat. facts, right?"

"you bet. but how you gonna pull it off this time?"

"alright, so here’s the vibe: we’re gonna scope out and snag any extra loot left behind in the staterooms, then yeet ourselves to shore and stash the cash. after that, we chill and wait. i’m telling you, it won’t be more than two hours before this wreck just breaks apart and washes away down the river. see? he’s gonna get drowned, and he can only blame himself. that’s hella better than actually offing him. i’m not about murdering a dude when you can dodge that mess; it’s straight-up dumb and uncool. facts, right?"

"yeah, i feel that. but what if it don’t just break up and float off?"

"we just chill for two hours and see what goes down, yeah?"

"cool, then; roll out."

so they bounced, and i peaced out in a cold sweat, scrambling forward. it was pitch dark af, but in a lowkey rough whisper, i go, "jim!" and he hit back right at my elbow with a moan, so i be like:

"quick, jim, no time for clownin' or moanin' around; there’s a squad of murderer creeps out yonder, and if we don’t track down their boat and set it drifting so these fools can’t dip from the wreck, one of ’em is gonna be in deep trouble. but if we snag their boat, we can put the whole crew in a hot mess—since the sheriff’s gonna clamp down. quick—hustle up! i’ll cover the labboard (port) side, you hit the stabboard (starboard). you start at the raft, and—"

"omg, lordy, lordy! raft? there’s no raft left, fam; she just broke loose and dipped—and here we are!"
