chapter i.

yo, so peep this: if you ain’t already lowkey read that adventures of tom sawyer joint, then you prolly know the vibe—but don’t even trip, ‘cause that book was dropped by mr. mark twain, and honestly, he kept it mostly 100. sure, he flexed a few extras here and there, but overall, the truth was on point. like, everyone’s been sus and told a fib every now and then—except for aunt polly, the widow, or maybe mary. aunt polly—yeah, tom’s aunt polly—and mary, plus the widow douglas, all star in that tale, which was almost all fact with just a bit of extra sauce.

now here’s where things go savage: tom and i stumbled on a massive cash drop—the robbers’ secret loot stashed in a dank cave—and boom, we were made. we snagged six thousand dollars each, all gold, no cap. the mound of coin was an epic flex. but then judge thatcher swooped in, flipped that paper into interest, and started dropping a dollar a day for each of us, all year round—enough green to leave anyone shook.

the widow douglas took me in like i was her own, promising to “civilize” me and all that, but living under her strict, proper regimen was a total vibe kill. so when i couldn’t handle the basic cringe any longer, i dipped out. i grabbed my ratty old rags and hopped back on my sugar-hogshead, feeling free and hella satisfied. then, outta nowhere, tom sawyer tracked me down, all hyped up about starting his own band of robbers—and he was like, “yo, join the squad if you’re willing to act all respectable back at the widow’s pad.” so, i slid right back in.

the widow went off, bawling over me like i was some lost little lamb, dropping a load of names on me, but never with true malice. she even copped me new clothes, and man, i was sweating buckets, feeling all cramped in that fancy setup. then, the same old routine kicked off: the widow rang a bell for supper and you had to show up, pronto. once you hit the dinner table, you weren’t allowed to just chomp down immediately; you had to wait for her to lower her head and grumble a bit about the food—even though, no lie, everything was cooked to perfection on its own. i guess when you mix a barrel of random odds and ends, the whole vibe magically levels up.

after supper, she busted out her book and started lecturing me about moses and the bulrushers, and i was amped to hear all about it—until, plot twist, she dropped that moses had been dead for ages. so, i was like, “k bye,” ‘cause dead peeps aren’t even on my radar.

not long after, i got this sudden urge to smoke and asked the widow if i could spark one up. she shut it down real quick, claiming it was a sketchy, dirty habit and that i needed to cut it out. classic, right? some folks get so extra about stuff they literally know zilch about. here she was, yammering on about moses—totally irrelevant now ‘cause he was done—and yet she had the nerve to diss my smoke sesh, even though she took snuff herself like it was cool.

then her sis, miss watson—a skinny, no-nonsense old maid rockin’ some goggles—rolled in to crash at her place. straight up, she started drilling me with a spelling-book lesson for about an hour until the widow finally let up. i was losing my mind. for the next hour, everything turned into a major snooze fest and i got all fidgety. miss watson kept chirping, “don’t put your feet up there, huckleberry;” then, “don’t scrunch up like that, huckleberry—sit up straight;” and soon enough, “don’t go all gap and stretch like that, huckleberry—act like you got some manners!” then she went on about this so-called bad place, and i half-joked that i’d be down to check it out. she flipped out, but i wasn’t trying to spark trouble—i just craved a change of scenery, no biggie. she clowned me for my words, swearing she’d never say them for the whole world because she was dead set on living strictly to earn her spot in the good place. i couldn’t see any perks in that lame plan, so i lowkey decided i wasn’t feeling it—but kept that on the DL ‘cause stirring the pot never helps.

while all that was going down, she kept on about the good place, saying that all you gotta do there is roam around with a harp and belt out tunes forever. i wasn’t vibing with that at all, but i said nothing. i even asked if she thought tom sawyer would be down for it, and she clapped back that there was zero chance. that was totally a win for me, ‘cause i was all about keeping tom in my crew.

miss watson kept pecking at me nonstop and it got old real quick. eventually, they hauled in the nay nays for prayers, and then everyone bounced to bed. i shuffled up to my room with a half-ass candle and set it on the table. i parked myself by the window, trying to cook up some cheerful thoughts, but nada—it was all dead vibes. i felt so mad lonesome, i legit wished i was already toast. the stars were blingin’, and the leaves out in the woods were whisperin’ in a super mournful jam; i could hear an owl off in the distance go “whoo-whoo” like it was mourning someone who checked out, plus a whippowill and a dog crying like they knew someone was about to dip for good. the wind was lowkey trying to drop secrets, but i couldn’t decode its drip, sending shivers all over. then, deep in the woods, i heard the kind of sound a ghost makes when it’s tryna spill its heart but can’t, so it’s doomed to roam every night in eternal grief. i got so down and shook with fear, i seriously wished for some company. next thing, a spider started creeping up my shoulder, and without thinking, i flicked it off—only for it to land in the candle flame and shrivel up like it got roasted. i didn’t need anyone tellin’ me that was a mega bad sign foreshadowing bad luck, so i got super scared and ended up shaking off all my clothes. i spun around three times, crossing my chest each round, and even tied a tiny lock of my hair with a thread to fend off witches. not gonna lie, i wasn’t feeling too confident about any of that—i’d heard it’s what you do when you lose a lucky horseshoe you found, instead of slapping it over your door, though no one ever confirmed it actually wards off bad juju after offing a spider.

i sat back down, still shakin’, and pulled out my pipe to snag a smoke—since the house was dead silent like a morgue, so the widow wouldn’t peep my move. after what felt like ages, i caught the town clock boom—boom—boom, dropping twelve solid licks; then everything went even quieter. soon, i heard a twig snap in the dark among the trees—something was stirring. i froze and tuned my ears in. i could barely catch a soft “me-yow! me-yow!” echoing from down below. that was dope, so i whispered back a tiny “me-yow! me-yow!” as softly as possible, then doused the light and scrambled out the window onto the shed. i slithered down to the ground and crawled among the trees, and sure enough, there was tom sawyer waiting for me.
