chapter viii.

when i woke, the sun was high – i figured it was past eight. i was loungin’ in the grass and cool shade, deep in thought, feelin’ mega comfortable and satisfied. i could peep the sun through a couple of holes, but mostly it was just thick trees everywhere – dark and moody vibes. spots of sunlight danced on the ground through the leaves, swayin’ here and there like a chill breeze was in play. a couple of squirrels kicked back on a limb, jabberin’ at me like they were my homies.

i was straight-up lazy and cozy – zero motivation to bounce up and whip up breakfast. then, i was dozin’ off when suddenly i caught this deep “boom!” echoing from up the river. i perked up, rested my elbow, and listened; before long, that boom hit again. i hopped up and peeked through a gap in the leaves, and saw a huge plume of smoke driftin’ on the water way up near the ferry. and there was the ferry-boat, jam-packed with peeps, floatin’ down. i immediately peeped what was goin’ down. “boom!” i watched as white smoke shot out from the side of the ferry-boat. check it – they were blastin’ cannon over the water, tryna force my dead body to surface.

i was mad hungry, but i wasn’t about to spark a fire – fearin’ they might clock the smoke. so, i sat there, watchin’ the cannon-smoke and listenin’ to the continuous boom. the river was a mile wide there, and it always looked pretty dope on a summer morn – so i was secretly enjoyin’ the show of them huntin’ for my remains while i just hung out. then it hit me – they always mix quicksilver in their bread loaves and set ‘em afloat, ‘cause they zero in on a drowned carcass and chill there. so, i thought, “bet, i’ll keep an eye out – if any of those floaters show up for my remainders, i’ll put on a show they won’t forget.” i hopped over to the illinois edge of the island to see what vibes were poppin’, and man, i wasn’t disappointed. a massive double loaf drifted by, and i almost snagged it with a long stick – but yo, my foot slipped and it floated even further. of course, i was right where the current was strongest near shore – i knew the drill. but soon, another one rolled in, and this time i bagged it. i yanked out the plug, shook off that dab of quicksilver, and chomped down hard. this was “baker’s bread” – quality eats, not your basic low-down corn-pone.

i parked myself among the leaves on a log, munching on the bread and peeping the ferry-boat, feeling super satisfied. then, something clicked. i was like, “yo, i bet the widow or the parson or someone prayed that this bread would find me – and look, it totally did. so, bet there’s some magic in it. not the kind that works for me though – i guess it only vibes with the right crew.”

i lit up my pipe, sucked on a long, thought-out smoke, and kept watchin’. the ferry-boat floated with the current, and i figured i’d get a good read on who was onboard when it came close to where the bread dropped. when it cruised real near, i stubbed out my pipe and peeped where i’d tossed the bread, then laid down behind a log on the bank in a chill open spot. at the fork of the log, i could peep through, scoped in on the whole scene.

by-and-by she rolled up, drifting super close so the crew could just dip off a plank and hit the shore. most of the squad was chillin’ on the boat—pap, judge thatcher, bessie thatcher, jo harper, tom sawyer, his old aunt polly, sid and mary, and a whole bunch more. everyone was spilling tea about the murder, but then the captain cut in and was like, “yo, keep it 100; the current’s takin’ over real close now, and maybe our guy washed ashore and got tangled up in the brush by the water’s edge. gotta hope, anyway.”

i wasn’t really feelin’ that vibe. they all crammed up, leanin’ over the rails so close it was almost in my face, and stood so still like it was a final boss vibe. i could peep every detail about them, but no cap they couldn’t peep me. then the captain went off and shouted, “stand away!” and the cannon blew a blast so wild right in front of me that it totally deef-ed my ears with the noise and nearly blinded me with smoke—i legit thought i was done for. ngl, if they’d been packing bullets, i bet they’d have snagged that corpse, fr. but mad props—I soon realized i wasn’t hurt, all thanks to some major luck. the boat floated on and dipped out of sight around the island’s shoulder. i could catch the boom pop now and then, fading into the distance, and after about an hour the noise just dipped out. the island spanned like three miles, and i figured they’d hit the bottom and be bailing, but nah—they weren’t done yet. they turned around the base and cruised up the channel on the missouri side, steaming along and droppin’ beats from the cannon every so often. i dipped over to that side and peeped them; when they lined up at the island’s head, they stopped the cannon fire, dropped down to the missouri shore, and bounced back to town.

i was like, yo, i’m straight now—nobody’s gonna come hunting for me. i grabbed my traps from the canoe and set up a lit camp deep in the woods. i rigged a makeshift tent out of my blankets to stash my gear so the rain couldn’t crash my vibe. i snagged a fat catfish and hacked it open with my saw, and as sundown hit, i lit my campfire and grubbed down. then i threw out a line to flex some fish for breakfast.

when it got dark, i chilled by the campfire, puffin’ smoke and feeling mad content; but real talk, loneliness started creeping in. so i bounced over to the bank, vibed with the current swashing by, counted stars, driftwood logs, and rafts floatin’ past, and then crashed—there’s literally no better way to kill time when you’re solo; eventually, you just grow out of that lonesome mood.

and that vibe went on for like three full days and nights—no cap, same old loop every time. but the next day, i went on an exploration sesh around the island. i was the boss of that spot—it was totally my playground, and i just had to scope every inch; mostly, i was just tryna pass the time. i scored mad strawberries, ripe and on point; plus, some fresh green summer grapes, green razberries, and even barely-there green blackberries just starting to pop. i figured those would be clutch later on.

so i wandered deep in the woods till i figured i wasn’t far from the island’s base. i kept my piece on me, though no cap i hadn’t shot a thing—it was all for protection, in case i needed to flex on some game for dinner. at one point, bruh almost stepped on a chunky snake, and it slid off like it was on a mission through the grass and blooms, so i chased after it hopin’ for a shot. i kept clippin’ along until, outta nowhere, i bounced right onto the ashes of a still-smokin’ campfire.

my heart legit jumped in my chest. i didn’t even pause to scope it out—I just uncocked my gun and dipped in full stealth-mode on my tiptoes, moving as fast as i could. every few seconds, i pried myself from the thick leaves to listen, but my heavy breath was drowning out everything else. i tiptoed further, then paused again, over and over. if i spotted a stump, i swore it was a dude; if a twig snapped beneath me, it felt like someone just split my breath in half—and i only got the short half, no cap.

when i finally hit camp, i was hella shook, but i was like, “this ain’t the time for clownin’ around.” so i hustled my traps back into the canoe to keep ‘em on the down-low, put out the fire, and scattered the ashes to look like an old, abandoned camp from last year—then i flexed and climbed a tree.

i spent, like, two hours up there; but no cap, i didn’t see or hear anything clear—I only felt like i caught a thousand vibes at once. eventually, i couldn’t stay up there forever, so i climbed down and hunkered in the thick woods, constantly staying on high alert. all the grub i could manage was berries and leftover bits from breakfast.

by nighttime, my stomach was on emergency mode. so when it got super dark, i dipped from shore pre-moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bank—like, a quarter mile away. i bounced into the woods, whipped up some supper, and was lowkey planning to crash there all night when suddenly i heard a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and thought, “yo, horses incoming,” and then caught voices. i grabbed all my gear and stashed it in the canoe fast as possible, then snuck through the woods to spy on what was up. i hadn’t gone far when i caught a dude saying, “yo, we should drop camp here if we can find a chill spot; the horses are beat, so let’s scope the area.”

i didn’t waste a sec—i bounced and paddled away easy, tied up at the old spot, and figured i’d crash in the canoe.

i didn’t sleep much, not gonna lie—the brain was on full hype. every time i woke up, i swore someone had grabbed my neck. so sleep was literally useless. eventually, i was like, “bruh, i can’t live like this; imma figure out who else is on this island with me—find it out or bust.” and just like that, i felt way better.

so i grabbed my paddle, dipped out from shore just a couple steps, and let the canoe drift through the shadows. the moon was straight up boppin’, and outside the darkness it was legit like daylight. i cruised for an hour while everything stayed rock-still and snoozin’. by then, i was near the island’s base—a fresh, cool breeze blowing confirmed that night was winding down. i steered the canoe closer to shore, then grabbed my piece and slid into the woods. i parked on a log and peeped out through the leaves, watching the moon dip out and darkness blanket the river like a boss. but after a minute, i peeped a pale streak over the treetops and was like, “bet, sunrise’s coming.” so i gripped my gun and slipped off toward where i’d bumped into that campfire, stopping every minute or two to listen. no cap, luck wasn’t on my side—I couldn’t locate the spot. eventually, for real, i caught a glimpse of fire through the trees. i slid over, cautious and slow-mo, and soon was close enough to see a dude laid out on the ground. man, that totally gave me the ultimate fan-tods. the dude had a blanket swagged around his head, and his dome was nearly in the flames. i parked behind a clump of bushes, about six feet away, keeping my eyes locked on him. as gray daylight started seeping in, he yawned, stretched, and tossed off that blanket—revealing miss watson’s jim! ngl, i was hella glad to see him. i bounced over and was like, “hello, jim!”

jim bounced up, eyeballing me wild, then dropped to his knees, folding his hands and saying, “doan’ hurt me—don’t! i ain’t ever done no harm to no ghost. i always been down with dead peeps and did all i could for ‘em. you just bounce back into your own river spot, whah you belong, and don’t mess with ole jim, ’cause he’s always been your ride or die.”

i didn’t take long to let him know i wasn’t toast—i was stoked to see jim, and suddenly, i wasn’t lonely anymore. i told him i wasn’t scared of him draggin’ me to the masses. we chatted for a bit, but he just chilled and stared, silent af. then i went, “hey, it’s legit daylight. let’s whip up some brekkie—fix up your campfire right.”

jim shot back, “yo, what’s the point of setting up the campfire to cook strawbries and such junk? you got a gun, ain’t you? then we could snag somethin’ way better than strawbries.”

i was like, “strawberries and junk—is that what you survive on?”

he replied, “i can’t score any other grub.”

i hit him with, “so how long you been posted on this island, jim?”

he went, “i rolled in here the night after you got clapped.”

i was like, “what, like all that time?”

“yep—indeedy,” he answered.

“and you ain’t had nothin’ but that kind of trash to chow down on?”

“nah, bro—nuffin’ else.”

i threw, “dang, you must be mad starved.”

he straight up said, “i reckon i could demolish a whole horse. i think so. so how long you been on this island?”

“since the night i got clapped.”

“no! then, how you been surviving? but yo, you got a gun. oh, for real, you got a gun—that’s good. now kill somethin’ and i’ll relight the fire.”

so we bounced over to the canoe, and while jim built a fire in a chill grassy clearing among the trees, i grabbed some meal, bacon, coffee, a coffee-pot, a frying-pan, sugar, and tin cups—and the nay nay got majorly set back, ‘cause he figured it was all witchcraft. ngl, i snagged a massive catfish too, and jim cleaned it up with his knife and fried it like a boss.

when breakfast was ready, we stretched out on the grass and devoured our chow, piping hot. jim attacked it with maximum force—he was straight-up starving. then, once we were hella stuffed, we chilled out. after a minute, jim goes, “but looky here, huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty if it wasn’t you?”

so i spilled the tea on the whole sitch, and he was like, “that’s smart. tom sawyer couldn’t even cook up a better plan than yours.” then i went, “how did you end up here, jim, and how’d you get here?”

jim looked mad shook and stayed quiet for a minute, then finally went, “maybe i better not tell.”

i pressed, “why, jim?”

he mumbled, “well, there’s reasons. but you won’t rat me out if i do tell you, right, huck?”

i was like, “blamed if i would, jim.”

he then said, “well, i believe you, huck. i—I bounced.”

“jim!” i called.

“but mind, you said you wouldn’t tell—you know you said you wouldn’t, huck.”

“yeah, i did. i said i wouldn’t, and i’m sticking to that, no cap. honest injun, i will. people might call me a low-down abolitionist and hate me for keeping quiet—but that don’t even matter. i’m not gonna tell, and i ain’t going back there anyway. so now, let’s spill the real tea.”

yo, so check it: it went like this. old missus—yup, miss watson—was always on my case, treating me rough af, but she always swore never to hand me over to orleans. but i peeped a nay nay trader lurkin’ around, hella active lately, and i got all jittery. so one night, i sneaked over, pooty late, the door wasn’t even fully locked, and i overheard old missus telling the widder she was fixin’ to sell me to orleans—she didn’t wanna, but she could get eight hundred bucks for me, no cap, and it was such a fat stack she couldn’t resist. the widder tried to talk her out of it, but i didn’t even stick around for the details. i dipped out mad quick, i tell you.

i bolted and slid down the hill, planning to swipe a skift along the sho’ above town, but people were stirring up mad noise, so i crashed in the old tumble-down cooper-shop on the bank to wait until everyone bounced. i was there all night; someone was always poppin’ up. around six in the mornin’, skifts began rollin’ by, and by like eight or nine, every skift was buzzin’ about how your pap rolled into town sayin’ you got clapped. those last skifts were loaded with ladies and gents peepin’ over to scope the scene. sometimes they’d chill at the sho’ for a bit before headin’ out, so from all the chatter, i got the full rundown on the killin’. i was hella sorry you got clapped, huck, but i ain’t feelin’ that vibe anymore.

i crashed under the shavin’s all day. i was hungry, but not scared, ‘cause i knew old missus and the widder were fixin’ to kick off a camp meetin’ right after breakfast and bounce for the whole day, and they knew i was off with the cattle by daylight—so they wouldn’t even bother lookin’ for me, and the other servants would dip as soon as the old folks were gone.

when it got dark, i bounced up the river road and rolled about two more miles until i hit a spot with zero houses. i had already planned out what i was ‘bout to do. see, if i kept trying to bounce on foot, the dogs would catch my scent; if i jacked a skift to cross over, they’d know exactly where i was posted on the other side—so i was like, “imma take a raft; it totally don’t leave a trace.”

i peeped a light comin’ around the p’int bymeby, so i waded in, shoved a log ahead, and swam more than halfway across the river, sliding into a driftwood zone while keepin’ my head low, and slowly paddled against the current until the raft drifted up. then i swam to its stern and clung on tight. it got cloudy and super dark for a minute, so i climbed up and crashed on the planks. the dudes were chillin’ way out in the middle where the lantern was lit. the river was on the up with a sick current; i figured that by four in the mornin’, i’d be twenty-five miles down the river, then sneak in just before daylight, swim ashore, and bounce into the woods on the illinois side.

but fr, luck wasn’t on my side. when we were nearly at the island’s head and a dude started comin’ at it with a lantern, i realized waiting was pointless—so i slid overboard and made a dash for the island. i had a vibe that i could land pretty much anywhere, but nah, the bank was too bluff. i mostly hit the island’s base before i found a decent spot. i dipped into the woods and figured i wouldn’t mess with rafts anymore, as long as that lantern kept movin’. i had my pipe, a dog-leg plug, and some matches in my cap—and they weren’t wet—so i was all set.

“and so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”
“how you gonna get ’em? you can’t just slide up on ’em and grab ’em; and how’s a dude supposed to smash ’em with a rock? like, how could anyone even pull that off at night? plus, i wasn’t tryna show up on the bank in daylight.”
“well, that’s facts. you’ve been stuck in the woods this whole time, obviously. did you catch them shootin’ the cannon?”
“oh, for sure. i peeped 'em right after you were around—I literally saw ’em roll by through the bushes.”

some young birds started vibin’, flying a yard or two at a time and flappin’ their wings. jim was like, “yo, that’s a sign it’s gonna rain.” he claimed it was the same vibe when young chickens roll that way—so he reckoned young birds were on that wavelength too. i was hyped to catch a few, but jim shut me down, sayin’ it was straight-up death. he told me his pops got mad sick once when some of those birds snatched a chick, and his granny said his dad would croak—and he did.

jim also dropped that you gotta not count out the meals you plan for dinner, ‘cause that jinxes your luck. same goes for shakin’ the tablecloth after sundown. and he said if a dude owns a beehive and then bounces, you gotta let the bees know before sunrise or they’ll all dip and quit work—maybe even croak. jim swore bees don’t sting idiots; but i wasn’t buyin’ it, ‘cause i’ve messed with bees plenty of times—and they never stung me.

i had heard some of this lore before, but not all of it. jim knew every sign under the sun—claimed he had the lowdown on practically everything. i was like, “yo, it all seems to scream bad luck—ain’t there any signs for good vibes?” he went, “very few—and honestly, they ain’t even useful. what would you even do when good luck’s droppin’? you tryna block it?” then he said, “if you got hairy arms and a hairy chest, that’s a sign you’re 'bout to be rich. there’s some major value in that sign ‘cause it’s way out there. like, maybe you gotta be broke for a long time first, and then you might get so discouraged you could even off yourself if you missed that sign of future riches.”
i asked, “jim, you got hairy arms and a hairy chest?”
“what’s the point of askin’? don’t you see i got ‘em?” he shot back.
i hit, “so, are you rich?”
“nah, but i was rich once, and i’m fixin’ to be rich again. once i had like fourteen bucks, but i went into that speculating game and got totally busted out.”
i probed, “so what’d you speculate in, jim?”
“first, i dabbled in stock,” he said.
“what kind of stock?”
“like, livestock—cattle, y’know. i dropped ten bucks on a cow, but i’m not tryna risk any more money in stock. the cow up and died in my hands.”
“so you lost ten bucks?”
“nah, not all of it. i only lost about nine bucks—i sold the hide and tanner for like a buck and ten cents.”
“you ended up with five bucks and ten cents left. you do any more speculating?”
“yeah. you know that one-laigged nay nay that belongs to old misto bradish? he set up a bank and claimed that anyone who put in a dollar would score four more at the end of the year. so all the nay nays jumped in, but they didn’t have much cash. i was the only one with serious funds. so i put in more than four bucks and was like, if i don’t get it, imma start my own bank. of course, that nay nay wanted to keep me out of the biz—he said there wasn’t enough business for two banks, so he offered, ‘you drop your five bucks and i’ll hit you with thirty-five at year’s end.’”
“so i did it. then i figured i’d invest that thirty-five right off to keep things movin’. there was a nay nay named bob who had snagged a wood-flat, and his master had no clue; i bought it off him and told him to take the thirty-five when the year wrapped up. but someone jacked the wood-flat that night, and the next day the one-laigged nay nay declared the bank busted—so none of us got a dime.”
“so what did you do with the ten cents, jim?”
“well, i was fixin’ to spend it, but then i had this dream that told me to give it to a nay nay named balum—yep, they call him balum’s ass for short; one of those chuckleheads, y’know. they say he’s lucky, though i ain’t feelin’ that vibe. the dream said let balum invest the ten cents and he’d score a raise for me. so balum tucked the money away, and when he was in church he heard the preacher say that whoever gives to the poor is blessed by the lord—gets his money back a hundred times. so balum cashed in, passed the ten cents to the poor, and chilled to see what went down.”
“so what came of it, jim?”
“nothin’ ever came of it. i couldn’t track that money at all—and balum couldn’t either. i ain’t tryna lend no more cash until i see some proper security. blessed to get your money back a hundred times, the preacher says! if i could get back that ten cents, i’d call it even and be hella stoked.”
“well, it's cool anyway, jim, as long as you turn rich again some time.”
“yeah—and i’m rich now, if you peep it. i own myself, and i'm worth eight hundred bucks. wish i had more, but i’m good.”
