chapter xvii.

in about a minute, somebody speaks outta a window—without even stickin’ his head out—and goes, “be done, boys! who’s there?”

i be like, “it’s me.”

“who’s me?”

“george jackson, sir.”

“what you want?”

“i ain’t wantin’ nothin’, sir. i just wanna roll through, but the dogs got me locked down.”

“what you even doin’ out here at this hour—yo?”

“i wasn’t prowlin’, sir, i straight‑up fell overboard off the steamboat.”

“oh, for real? someone light that up—what’s your handle?”

“george jackson, sir. i’m just a kid.”

“listen up, if u’re straight‑up real then no front—nobody’s gonna mess with u. but don’t even try to budge; stay right where u are. rouse up bob and tom, y’all, and grab the guns. george jackson, got anyone else with u?”

“nah, sir, no one.”

i heard folks stirrin’ inside the crib and peeped a light. the dude hollered, “yo, betsy, snatch that light away, you old fool—ain’t u got any sense? stash it on the floor behind the front door. bob, if you and tom are set, take your spots.”

“all in, fam.”

“now, george jackson, you know the shepherdsons?”

“nah, sir; never caught a hint of them.”

“well, that might be, or might not. now, all set. step forward, george jackson. and remember, don’t rush—come slow. if anyone’s with you, have ‘em hang back—if they show up, they’ll get clapped. come on now. go slow; push the door open just enough to squeeze in, ya feel?”

i didn’t rush; i couldn’t even if i wanted to. i took one slow step at a time in dead silence—i swear, i could hear my heart thumpin’. the dogs were as mute as the humans, followin’ a bit behind. when i reached the three‑log steps, i heard them unlockin’, unbarrin’, and unboltin’. i placed my hand on the door and pushed it inch by inch until somebody said, “aight, that’s enough—put your head in.” so i did, though i figured they might just snatch it off.

the candle was on the floor, and there they were, starin’ at me while i stared back for like a quarter minute—three big dudes with guns aimed at me, makin’ me wince, i swear; the eldest was gray and around sixty, the other two in their thirties or so—each fine and fly—and the chillest old gray‑headed lady, backed by two young ladies i couldn’t peep too clear.

the old gent goes, “there; i reckon it’s all good. come on in.”

as soon as i got inside, the old gent locked, barred, and bolted the door, and told the young guns to come in with their firepower. they all bounced into a huge parlor with a fresh rag carpet and huddled in a corner outta the range of the front windows—there weren’t any on the side. they held the candle and gave me a solid once‑over, all sayin’, “damn, he ain’t a shepherdson—nah, no shepherdson vibe on him.” then the old man said he hoped i wouldn’t mind gettin’ searched for arms, ‘cause he didn’t mean no harm—it was just to be sure. so he didn’t dig into my pockets, just felt ‘em with his hands and said it was all chill. he told me to kick it, get comfy, and spill my story; but then the old lady goes,

“man, bless you, saul, this poor kid is drippin’ wet; and don’t u figure he might be starvin’?”

“facts, rachel—I totally spaced.”

so the old lady says, “betsy” (this was a nay nay woman), “zoom around and whip up somethin’ to eat for him ASAP, poor thing; and one of y’all go wake up buck and let him know—oh, here he comes himself. buck, take this lil stranger, peel off his wet gear, and hook him up in some of your dry threads.”

buck looked about my age—like thirteen or fourteen, though he was a bit bigger than me. dude was rockin’ nothin’ but a tee and sportin’ a mad messy ‘do. he strolled in, all gaping and scratchin’ at his eyes with one fist, draggin’ a gun in the other. he goes, “ain’t no shepherdsons around?”

they said it was just a false alarm.

“well,” he says, “if they’d been around, i reckon i’da nabbed one.”

they all cracked up, and bob chimed in, “yo buck, they might’ve straight‑up scalped us all—you’ve been hella slow gettin’ here.”

“man, nobody’s chasin’ me, and it ain’t cool bein’ held back; i don’t get no limelight.”

“chill, buck, my boy,” the old man says, “u’ll get your time to shine, all in due time, so don’t sweat it. now bounce, and do what your mama said.”

when we rolled upstairs to his room, he hooked me up with a rough tee, a roundabout, and some pants of his, and i rocked ‘em on. while i was gettin’ dressed, he asked my name, but before i could spill it, he started goin’ off about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had bagged in the woods day before yesterday, then asked where moses was when the candle dipped out. i was like, “i dunno; never heard that one before, fr.”

“well, guess.”

“how am i supposed to guess,” i say, “when i never caught wind of that before?”

“but u can guess, right? it’s super easy.”

“which candle?” i ask.

“yo, any candle,” he goes.

“i ain’t know where he was,” i say; “so where was he?”

“dude, he was in the dark! that’s where he was!”

“well, if u knew where he was, then why even ask?”

“man, fuck it—it’s a riddle, don’t u see? so, how long you gonna crash here? u gotta stay, always. we can just have booming times—no school now. u got a dog? i got one—and he’ll dive in the river and fetch chips for u to toss in. u down to comb up sundays and all that nonsense? bet i ain’t, but ma makes me. damn these old britches! i guess i’d better rock ‘em on, though i’d ruther not ‘cause it’s mad warm. y’all set? all right. roll out, old hoss.”

cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that’s what they served me down there, and no cap, it was fire. buck, his ma, and his crew all puffed on cob pipes—except the nay nay woman, who was gone, and the two young ladies. they smoked and chatted, and i munched and gossiped. the young ladies had quilts draped around them with their hair flowin’ down their backs. they grilled me with questions, and i spilled how pap, me, and the fam were livin’ on a lil farm at the bottom of arkansaw, how my sis mary ann bounced, got hitched, and then disappeared, and how bill went huntin’ and was never heard from again, and how tom and mort dipped, leavin’ just me and pap—and he got trimmed down to nothin’ ‘cuz of his mess-ups; so when he dipped, i grabbed what was left (since the farm was never really ours) and hit the river, catchin’ deck passage, and ended up fallin’ overboard—and that’s how i wound up here. they said i could crash in a home there as long as i wanted. then daylight hit, everybody crashed, and i bunked with buck—and when i woke up in the mornin’, drat, i forgot my own name. i laid there for like an hour tryna remember, and when buck woke up, i said,

“can u spell, buck?”

“yeah,” he says.

“i bet u can’t spell my name,” i challenge.

“i bet u, if u dare, i can,” he snaps.

“aight, go for it.”

“g-e-o-r-g-e j-a-x-o-n—boom,” he says.

“damn, u nailed it, but i never thought u could. that’s dope—spelling it like u just dropped it without any cheat codes.”

i jotted it down, all private, ‘cause someone might call on me to spell it next, and i wanna be ready to drop it like i always do.

the fam was hella nice, and the crib was on a whole ‘nother level. i ain’t never seen a house out in the boonies that was so fly and drippin’ with style. it didn’t rock any iron latch on the front door or a wooden one with a buckskin string; nah, it had a brass knob like the city cribs do. there wasn’t even a bed in the parlor—not a sign of one—even though tons of town parlors have beds. there was a huge fireplace with a brick base, and those bricks were kept mad clean and red by pourin’ water on ‘em and scrubbin’ ‘em down with another brick; sometimes they’d slap on red water‑paint they called spanish‑brown, just like in town. they had massive brass dog‑irons that could prop up a saw‑log. smack in the middle of the mantelpiece was a clock, with a pic of a town painted on the lower half of its glass front and a round spot in the center for the sun, with a pendulum swingin’ behind it. hearin’ that clock tick was pure vibes; and sometimes when one of these peddlers came through, cleaned it up real nice, she’d start tickin’ up a hundred‑fifty times before finally tappin’ out. they wouldn’t take any cash for her.

also, there was this massive, out‑there parrot on each side of the clock, made of some chalk‑like stuff and painted ridiculously gaudy. next to one was a cat made of crockery, and on the other, a crockery dog; when u pressed ‘em, they squeaked but didn’t even open their mouths or change their vibe. they just squeaked on the low. a couple of huge wild‑turkey‑wing fans were spread out behind those pieces. dead center on the table was this cute crockery basket stacked with apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes—way redder, yellower, and prettier than the real ones, but clearly fake ‘cause u could see chipped bits of white chalk underneath.

this table had a fly-ass oilcloth cover, all decked out with a dope red n blue spread eagle vibe and a sick painted border all around – like, straight up epic decor, no cap. they were all like “yo, this came straight from philadelphia,” and honestly, that was peak flex material. plus, there was a stack of books, perfectly Tetris-blocked on each corner of the table. one was this massive fam bible full of bomb-ass pictures; another was pilgrim’s progress, telling the story of a dude who ghosted his fam with no explanation – i’d peep bits of it on the reg, and while the quotes were hella interesting, they were also hella hardcore. next up was friendship’s offering, jam-packed with aesthetic vibes and poetry; but honestly, i wasn’t about that poetry reading life. then came henry clay’s speeches and dr. gunn’s family medicine – basically the ultimate guide on what to do when someone’s sick or straight up dead. oh, and there was a hymn book plus a whole avalanche of other books. and let’s not forget those split-bottom chairs that were mad chill and sturdy – not all janky and busted like some thrift basket.

the walls were dripping with pics – mostly washingtons and lafayettes, epic battles, highland marys, and one titled “signing the declaration.” they even hung up some pieces they called crayons – low-key, one of the daughters (who’s now ghosted) whipped up her own art when she was just fifteen. these pieces weren’t like any generic art i’d seen before – they were darker af than most. one pic showed a chick in a slim black dress, cinched small under the armpits, with sleeve bulges popping like a cabbage, rocking a huge black scoop-shovel bonnet capped off with a black veil; her white skinny ankles were all tied up with black tape, and she was sporting teeny black slippers that looked like a chisel. she was leaning all pensive on a tombstone with her right elbow, chillin’ under a weeping willow; meanwhile, her other hand was casually hanging by her side clutching a white hanky and a reticule, and below the pic it read “shall i never see thee more alas.” then there was another of a young lady with her hair combed upward to a slick top-knot – tied neatly in front of a comb like a fancy chair-back – crying into a hanky while clutching a dead bird (flipped on its back, heels up) in her other hand; and below that one it read “i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas.” there’s also a piece of a young chick posted at a window, gazing up at the moon with tears streaming down her cheeks; she’s holding an open letter in one hand that shows some black sealing wax along the edge, and she’s pressing a chain-linked locket to her mouth – captioned “and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas.” all these pics were pretty aesthetic, i guess, but low-key whenever i was feeling down, they would hit me with a major vibe check. everyone was super sad she died, ‘cause she had a bazillion more pics planned that would’ve been next level, and you could totally tell what the fam lost by what she left behind. but i figured with her edgy disposition, she was probably chillin’ harder in the graveyard. she was working on what they called her magnum opus when she got sick – praying day and night to live long enough to finish it – but she never got that final save. the masterpiece was of a young woman in a long white gown, posted on the rail of a bridge, about to yeet herself, with her hair flowing, staring up at the moon as tears rolled down her face. she had two arms folded over her chest, two stretched out in front, and two more reaching upward for the moon – like, she was deciding which arm combo looked best before yeeting the extras; but, as i said, she died before she could finalize her edits, so now they hang that pic above her bed, and every birthday they deck it out with flowers. sometimes, they even hide it behind a little curtain. real talk: while the young woman had a sweet, gentle face, all those extra arms made her look like a spidery glitch in the matrix.

this young girl was all about that scrap-book life while she was alive, slapping inside obituaries, accidents, and all the juicy drama of patient suffering straight from the presbyterian observer, then spitting out her own mad poetry. and yo, her poetry was fire. check this out – she dropped this ode for a dude named stephen dowling bots who dipped hard by falling down a well:

ode to stephen dowling bots, dec’d

and did young stephen get hacked, and did young stephen dip? and did the sad squad level up, and did the mourners cry? nah; that wasn’t the fate for young stephen dowling bots. even though the sad vibes were cranking up around him, it wasn’t ‘cause he caught any disease drops. no whooping-cough wrecked his frame, nor measles with lame spots; nothing messed with the legendary status of stephen dowling bots. despised love didn’t slam his curly mop, nor did stomach drama bring him down—young stephen dowling bots. oh nah. so peep with tearful eyes as i spill: his soul yeeted outta this cold world by falling down a well. they hauled him out and drained him; but fam, it was too late – his spirit was gone, flexing with the big leagues.

if emmeline grangerford could drop verses that lit up like that before she hit fourteen, there’s zero cap on what she could’ve slayed later. buck said she could spit lines like it was nothing – never needing to pause for a brain break. he claimed she’d drop a line, and if a rhyme wouldn’t pop, she’d just scratch it out and hit you with another, non-stop. she wasn’t picky; she could write about whatever you tossed her way, as long as it hit those sad feels. every time someone iced – man, woman, or kid – she was always on deck with her “tribute” before they even got cold. she called ‘em tributes. the neighbors would spill that the doc went first, then emmeline, then the undertaker – though the undertaker only ever beat emmeline once, when she dropped a fire rhyme for a deceased dude named whistler. after that, she just wasn’t the same; she never threw a fit, but she slowly pined away and didn’t hang around long. poor emmeline – so many times i forced myself to slide up to her old room, flip through her dusty scrap-book when her pics were jamming my vibe and i started dissing her a bit. i was down with the whole fam – dead ones and all – and wasn’t gonna let nothing come between us. poor emmeline poured out poetry about every iced-out soul when she was alive, so it felt hella off that there was nobody spitting verses about her now that she was gone; so i tried to hustle a verse or two myself, but my brain just couldn’t sync. they kept emmeline’s room mad trim and on fleek, all set up just like she liked when she was alive, and literally no one ever crashed there. the old lady held it down herself, even though there was plenty of nay nay around, and she spent a ton of time sewing and mostly vibing with her bible.

yo, so about the parlor – the windows were rockin these gorgeous white curtains, painted up with epic castles draped in vines and cattle rolling in for a drink. there was even this quaint old piano – probably rigged with tin pans – and nothing was as chill as hearing the young ladies serenade with “the last link is broken” and drop beats of “the battle of prague” on it. every room had its walls plastered up, most had carpets on the floors, and the whole crib was whitewashed on the outside – aesthetic goals on deck.

it was a double crib, and the massive open zone between ‘em was fully roofed and floored, sometimes even hosting the table in the middle of the day as a chill hangout. nothing was better, ngl. and the cooking? straight fire, my dude – endless servings of bomb food, no cap!
