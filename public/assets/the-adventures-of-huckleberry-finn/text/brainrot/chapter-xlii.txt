chapter xlii.

the old man popped back uptown before brekkie but couldn’t track tom down; so both of ‘em sat at the table in silence, lookin’ hella gloomy, their coffee gettin’ cold while they skipped the chow. after a minute, the old man goes, “did i hand you the letter?”

“what letter?”

“the one i snagged from the post office yesterday.”

“nah, you didn’t drop any letter on me.”

“well, i must’ve forgotten it.” so he rummaged through his pockets, bounced off to where he’d left it, grabbed it, and handed it over. she goes, “yo, it’s from st. petersburg—it’s from sis.”

i figured another walk would chill me out, but i was frozen. before she could even open it, she dropped it and bolted—‘cause she peeped something. and so did i. turns out, it was tom sawyer loungin’ on a mattress; that old doc; and jim, rockin’ a calico dress with his hands tied behind him; plus a whole crew of people. i stashed the letter behind the first thing that came to hand and bolted. she jumped on tom, cryin’, and goes,

“oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, i know he’s dead!”

tom turned his head a bit, muttering some shady stuff that showed he wasn’t in his right mind; then she threw her hands up and goes,

“he’s alive, thank god! and that’s it!” and she snagged a kiss off him, then jetting off to the crib to get the bed prepped, scatterin’ orders left and right at the nay nay and everyone else, faster than her tongue could spit.

i trailed the crew to peep what they were gonna do with jim; the old doc and uncle silas followed after tom into the house. the dudes were mad heated—some were ready to hang jim as a warning to all the other nay nay out there so none would ghost like jim and stir up a crazy mess, keepin’ a whole fam shook for days and nights. but the rest were like, “nah, that ain’t it; he ain’t our nay nay, and his owner would show up and make us cough up cash, for real.” that cooled the vibe a bit, ‘cause honestly, the folks hyped to hang a nay nay for messin’ up are usually the very ones who ain’t down to drop mad dough when they finally get their satisfaction.

they were cussin’ jim heavy, smacking him on the head every once in a while, but jim kept hush and never gave me the once-over. they hauled him to the same cabin, shuffled his own threads on him, chained him up AGAIN—not to a bed-leg this time but to a massive staple driven into the bottom log, chaining his hands and both legs—and decreed he’d have nothing but bread and water ’til his owner showed up, or else he’d be auctioned off if he didn’t clock in time. then they padded our hole and arranged for a couple of farmer dudes with guns to stand watch around the cabin every night, with a bulldog strapped to the door by day.

around then, they wrapped up with a bunch of farewell cussin’, and then the old doc rolls in to scope it out, saying, “yo, don’t be harsher than you gotta be, cuz this nay nay ain’t all that bad. when i got to the kid, i seen i couldn’t yank the bullet out on my own—needed backup—and he was in no shape for me to dip and grab help; he kept gettin’ worse, lost his head, and wouldn’t let me near him, even threatenin’ to off me if i messed with his raft—mad wild stuff. so i said, i need help ASAP; and the minute i put it out there, this nay nay crawled in from nowhere and offered to help, and he totally nailed it. obviously, i figured he must be a runaway nay nay, and there i was, stuck on this grind all day and night. it was a fix, i tell you! i had a couple of patients with the chills, and sure, i wanted to jet to town to check on ‘em, but i couldn’t, ‘cause the nay nay might dip and then it’d all be on me; and no skiff came close enough for me to hail. so i had to hang tight until dawn this mornin’. i’ve never seen a nay nay as down-to-earth or real as him—despite risking his freedom, he was exhausted and clearly been hustlin’ hard. i dug the nay nay for that; a nay nay like him is worth a thousand dollars—and solid vibes too. i had everything i needed, and the kid was doin’ just as well as he would back home—maybe even better ’cause it was mad quiet; but there i was, stuck with both of ‘em till about dawn this mornin’. then some dudes in a skiff roll by, and luck be jacked—the nay nay was chillin’ by the pallet, head propped on his knees, fast asleep; so i signaled the crew on the low, they snuck up on him, grabbed him, and tied him up before he knew what hit him, and we had zero drama. since the kid was in a deep, half-asleep haze, we muffled the oars, hitched the raft, and towed her over all smooth, and the nay nay didn’t make a peep or row a single bit from start to finish. he ain’t a bad nay nay, gentlemen; that’s my take on him.”

someone goes, “yo, doc, that sounds lit, i’m vibe-checking that.” then the others chilled out a bit, and i was mad thankful to that old doc for doin’ jim such a solid; i was stoked it matched my own vibe of him, ‘cause i always thought he had a dope heart from day one. so everyone agreed that jim had played his role big time and deserved a proper shout-out and reward. they all straight-up promised, all in, that they wouldn’t drop any more cussin’ on him.

then they hauled him out and locked him up. i was low-key hopin’ they’d slack off on the chains ‘cause they were hella heavy or even hook him up with some meat and greens along with his bread and water; but nah, they didn’t even think of it. i figured it wasn’t best for me to mix in, so i vowed i’d slide the doc’s full yarn to aunt sally as soon as i navigated past those breakers ahead—basically, to drop the deets on how i totally forgot to mention sid got shot when me and him were paddlin’ that wild night chasing the runaway nay nay.

i had plenty of time anyway. aunt sally stuck to the sickroom all day and night, and every time i saw uncle silas mooning around, i dodged him.

next morning, word was tom was way better, and they said aunt sally dipped out for a nap. so i slid over to the sickroom, thinkin’ if i caught him awake, we could spin a story for the fam that would fly. but he was deep asleep—mad peaceful and looking all pale instead of his usual fiery self. so i sat down and waited for him to wake. in about half an hour, aunt sally glides in, and there i am, back on deck! she signals for me to chill, sits beside me, and starts whisperin’, sayin’ we can all vibe now ‘cause his symptoms are 10/10, he’s been in that deep sleep forever, and he’s lookin’ smoother and more peaceful by the sec—like, ten out of ten, he’ll wake up all proper.

yo, that’s it.

so we were just chillin', eyes glued, and after a hot minute my bro stirred a bit, popped his lids open all casual, peeped around, and goes:
"yo—mad real, i'm home, no cap! what’s the vibe? where's our raft at?"

"it's all good," i muttered.

"and jim?"

"still the same," i replied, lowkey not flexin’ too hard. but he totally skipped that and fired off:
"lit! dope news! now we're all chill and safe! did you spill it to aunty?"

i was lowkey gonna say yes, but she jumped right in and goes:
"about what, sid?"

"yo, about how we pulled off the whole stunt."

"what whole stunt?"

"bro, the only one—the epic drop of how me and tom freed the runaway nay nay."

"good land! drop the run—what the heck is this kid even on about? yo, he's trippin' again!"

"nah, i'm not buggin', i got my facts straight. we did free him—me and tom. we planned it down to the last tea drop, and we straight-up slayed it. and we did it with that extra finesse, no cap."

he kinda paused, and aunty never gave him a reality check—she just sat there starin', lettin' him spill his saga, and i was like, nah, ain't no point in me even chippin' in.

"yo, aunty, it took us mad grind—weeks on end, hour after hour each night while you were snoozin'. and we had to jack candles, sheets, shirts, your dress, spoons, tin plates, case-knives, the warming-pan, the grindstone, flour, and a crazy stack of stuff. and you wouldn't even believe the hustle it took to whip up saws, pens, engravings, and a bunch of other dope bits—plus, half the fun was in the chaos."

"and we had to sketch out coffin memes and all that, fake anonymous notes from those shady robbers, climb up and down that lightning rod, dig a hole in the crib, rig a rope ladder and sneak it into a baked pie, and stash spoons and other random swag in your apron pocket—"

"mercy sakes!"

"—and pack the crib with rats and snakes and whatever to keep jim company; and then you kept tom in place with the butter in his hat so long that you almost jinxed the whole move, 'cause the dudes showed up before we could bounce, and we had to make a mad dash, they caught our vibe and started clappin' on us, and i snagged my cut. we dodged their path and let them roll by, and when the dogs showed up, they weren't after us but craved the extra noise. then we grabbed our canoe, cruised to the raft, and boom—we were safe, and jim was a certified free man, all thanks to our solo hustle, wasn't that epic, aunty!"

"yo, i've never peeped anything like this in my whole life! so it was you, you little bad-monkeys, causin' all this chaos, turnin' everyone's brain vibes upside down and scarin' us stiff. i've been feelin' the urge to come at you hard this very minute. like, get your act together just once, kiddo, or i'mma roast both of you, no cap!"

but tom was hella hyped and proud, couldn't keep his mouth shut—his words just flowed non-stop while she fired back snark like a pro, and they were both goin' off like a wild cat meme meetup; and she declares:

"yo, enjoy all the drama now, but listen up—if i catch you messin' with him again—"

"messin' with who?" tom snaps, droppin' his goofy grin for a sec and lookin' all surprised.

"with who? duh, the runaway nay nay, obviously. who else you thinkin' of?"

tom gives me that serious side-eye and goes:

"yo, tom, didn't you just say he was chill? hasn't he dipped yet?"

"him?" aunt sally interjects, "the runaway nay nay? nah fam, he ain't free— they snagged him, all safe and sound, and now he's back in that crib surviving on stale bread and water, all clamped in chains until someone claims or sells him!"

tom straight-up jumped up in bed, his eye lit and nostrils flappin' like they're in an aquarium, and he blasts:

"they got zero right to lock him down! like seriously—don't even waste a minute. set him free! he ain't nobody's property; he's as free as any creature bustin' moves on this planet!"

"what the kid even mean?"

"i mean every single word, aunty, and if nobody steps up, i'll step in. i've known him forever, and so has tom. old miss watson kicked the bucket like two months ago, and she was hella embarrassed to even think about sellin' him down the river, so she straight-up freed him in her will."

"so like, why did you even bother freeing him if he was already free?"

"bro, that's a legit question—pure woman drama vibes! i wanted the mad adventure of it all; i would've gone neck-deep in blood to—holy freak, aunty polly!"

if she wasn't lurkin' right there, just inside the door, lookin' all chill and angelic with a half-full pie vibe, i swear, i hope i never peep that again!

aunty sally practically leaped, hugged her like she was about to snatch her whole head, and bawled hard, while i slid under the bed 'cause things were gettin' mad heated for us. i peeked out, and after a minute, tom's aunty polly shook off her vibes and stood there givin' tom a death-glare over her specs—as if she was 'bout to meme him into the dirt, you know. then she fires off:

"yo, you better look away—if i were you, tom."

"oh, snap!" aunt sally goes, "is he switchin' up that hard? like, that's not tom, that's sid; tom's—tom's—yo, where'd tom go? he was chillin' right here a sec ago."

"you mean where's huck finn? that's what you're tryna say! i mean, i ain't raised my tom to be so clueless about his bro when i spot him. that'd be a straight-up wild scene. come out from under that bed, huck finn."

so i did just that. but lowkey, i wasn't feelin' all that hype.

aunty sally was one of the craziest mix-up peeps i've ever seen—aside from uncle silas, who rolled in and got the whole 411. it got him so lit, tbh, that he zonked out for the rest of the day, and then dropped a prayer-meeting sermon that night so wild it bagged him a killer rep, cuz the oldest dude around couldn't even process it, no cap.

so tom's aunty polly spilled all the deets about who i was and what was poppin'; and i had to come clean about gettin' stuck in such a tight sitch that when mrs. phelps pegged me for tom sawyer—she chimed in, "oh, just call me aunty sally, i'm used to it now, no need to switch it up"—i had no choice but to roll with it, 'cause there was literally no other move, and i knew he wouldn't even care, bein' all mysterious and turnin' it into an epic adventure, perfectly on brand. so it all went down, and he had to play the role of sid, making things as chill as he could for me.

and his aunty polly confirmed that tom was dead-on about old miss watson freein' jim in her will; so, no cap, tom sawyer went through all that wild hassle to set a free nay nay free! and i could never wrap my head around how he could ever vibe with helpin' someone get freed just through his upbringin'—until that talk dropped.

well, aunty polly also dropped that when aunty sally texted her that tom and sid had rolled in safe, she was like:

"yo, check that out now! i kinda expected it, lettin' him bounce like that with no one watchin'. so now i gotta trek down the river—like 1100 miles deep—and peep what that weirdo's up to this time; since i ain't been gettin' any receipts from you about it."

"bro, i never got nothin' from you," snaps aunty sally.

"for real? i literally hit you up twice askin' what u meant by sid droppin' in."

"nah, i didn't even peep 'em, sis."

aunty polly slowly spins around, all severe, and fires off:

"yo, tom!"

"well—what?" he snaps, a bit salty.

"don't you disrespect me, you impudent lil misfit—hand over them letters, pronto."

"what letters?"

"them letters, duh. i'm tellin' you, if i gotta go all in on you, i'll—"

"they're chillin' in the trunk. there, now. and they're exactly as fresh as when i pulled 'em from the office. i haven't even peeped them, but i knew they'd stir up drama, so if you weren't in a mad rush, i thought i'd—"

"yo, you're def in for a beatdown, no cap. and i hit you up with another one sayin' i was comin'; and i guess he—"

"nah, it dropped yesterday; i haven't peeped it yet, but it's all good, i've got that one."

i was lowkey 'bout to bet two bucks she hadn't peeped it, but figured it's safer to let it ride. so i kept my trap shut.
