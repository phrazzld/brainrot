chapter xv.

so, we figured three more nights would have us chillin' in cairo—down at the illinois end where the ohio river slides in—and that was the move. our masterplan was to ditch the raft, jump on a steamboat, paddle up the ohio into the free states, and then be totally out of the drama.

on night two, a thick fog started rollin' in, so we aimed for a tow-head to anchor to, cuz honestly, you can't be speedrunning through a fog. when i paddled ahead in the canoe, line in hand to secure it, i only found a bunch of puny saplings. i looped the line around one right at the cut bank's edge, but then the current turned savage, and our raft came barreling in like a boss—ripping that tie out by the roots and bouncin' off.

i peeped the fog closing in, and it got me so queasy and shook that i couldn't even move for what felt like a half-minute—then boom, the raft straight up ghosted; i couldn't see past like twenty yards, no cap.

i bounced back into the canoe, scrambled to the stern, grabbed the paddle, and gave her a hefty stroke. but fr fr, she didn't come. i was so hyped and panicked, i didn't even bother untying her properly. when i did try to untie, my hands were jittery like lag in a gaming sesh—barely able to do anything.

the minute i got moving again, i chased that raft full send, hot and heavy, right past the tow-head. it was all chill until i realized the tow-head was barely sixty yards long, and the second i blasted past its foot, i shot straight into a wall of solid white fog—losing all sense of direction like a total noob.

i figured, nah, paddling ain't the move; i'd probably end up crashing into a bank or tow-head or something. i needed to chill and drift, though keeping your hands perfectly still in that mess is like trying to land a clutch shot with lag. so i started whooping and listening. somewhere down low, i caught a tiny whoop echo, and instantly my spirits shot up. i tore after it, ears straining for a repeat drop. next time, i peeped that my path was veering to the right of it; then after, i was sliding left—yet i wasn't gaining on it at all, 'cause i was zigzaggin' all over while that whoop kept marching straight ahead like a boss.

i lowkey wished that clown would just bang on a tin pan non-stop to drop a steady beat, but he never did. it was in the silent gaps between the whoops that i nearly lost my mind. anyway, i kept hustlin', and outta nowhere, i heard a whoop coming from behind. damn, i got all tangled up—was that some other dude's whoop, or had i spun around, no cap?

i chucked the paddle down and listened. the whoop came again; still behind me but in a diff spot—it kept bouncing around, and i kept calling back until, eventually, it popped up in front of me. i knew then that the current had flipped the canoe's front downstream, and i was cool with that if it was jim hollering, not some random raft dude. in a fog, all voices sound sus and off, ya feel me?

the whooping kept banging, and about a minute later, i slammed into a cut bank lit by eerie, smoky outlines of giant trees. the savage current flipped me left and zoomed past, slicing through a bunch of snags that roared like a mosh pit—seriously, the current was on a next-level speed run.

in a sec or two, everything turned back to solid white and dead still. i froze, just listenin' to my heart go boom-boom, and swear down i didn't even breathe a single hit while that thing was thumpin' like a hundred beats per minute.

i straight up tapped out—that cut bank was a legit island, and jim had dipped to its other side. this wasn't just a tiny tow-head you could float by in ten minutes; it was a massive island, with heavyweight timber stretching out maybe five or six miles long and over half a mile wide.

so i kept it low-key for like fifteen minutes, ears locked in. even though i was drifting at four or five miles an hour, it felt like i was totally stationary on the water. if a snag barely flashes by, you don't even clock the speed—you just catch your breath and think, 'dang, that snag's on turbo mode.' if u ain't felt the bleak, lonesome vibes of drifting solo in a foggy night, u gotta try it once, no cap.

next, for about thirty minutes, i dropped random whoops now and then. finally, i heard an answering whoop echoing from far off and tried to chase it, but ugh, i just couldn't lock on—i soon figured i was stuck in a nest of tow-heads, with dim, fleeting glimpses of 'em on both sides. sometimes there was barely a channel between 'em, and other times i knew they were there 'cause i heard the current splash against old, dead brush and trash hanging over the banks. honestly, i didn't last long chasing those whoops amidst the tow-head chaos; i only tried for a hot minute, 'cause it was crazier than chasing a jack-o'-lantern—sounds dodgin' around and swapping spots like they were in a remix battle, bruh.

i literally had to scramble off the bank four or five times to stop smacking the islands outta the river, so i figured our raft was probably bumping into the bank now and then. otherwise, it'd be sprinting ahead and vanish from our earshot—it was just floating a bit faster than i was.

eventually, i found myself back in the open river, but i couldn't catch any whoop signals anywhere. i figured maybe jim had hit a snag and was done for, so feeling hella exhausted, i crashed in the canoe, deciding to bounce on the chase. i wasn't tryna sleep, but i was so zonked that a quick catnap seemed like the only option.

but yo, it turned out to be way more than a catnap. when i came to, the stars were lit up like a rave, the fog had bounced, and i was spinning down a massive bend, stern first. at first, i was like, 'am i even awake or just trippin'?' and as memories slowly loaded, it felt like everything was coming in dim from last week.

man, the river here was monstrous—flanked by the tallest, thickest timber walls you could ever peep, like a solid fortress of trees under the starlight. i scanned downstream and spotted a tiny black speck floatin' on the water. i chased after it, but when i got close, it turned out to be just a couple of sawlogs strapped together. then i peeped another speck, chased that one; then another—and this time, i locked on. it was our raft, for real.

when i reached it, jim was posted with his head drooping between his knees, straight snoozing, his right arm casually hanging over the steering-oar. the other oar was totally wrecked, and the raft was decked out in leaves, branches, and grime. clearly, she had been through some savage shenanigans.

i hauled myself onto the raft, parked right under jim's snoozing mug, and started roastin' him—flailing my fists and saying:

“hey, jim, was i asleep or what? why didn't u wake me up, bro?”

“woah, bruh, is that really u, huck? and u ain't dead—u ain't drowned—u're back again? it's so unreal, fam, too lit to be true. let me peep at you, my dude, let me feel ya out. nah, u ain't dead! u're totally back, alive and vibin', just the same ol' huck—our same ol' huck, all thanks to mad blessings!”

“yo, jim, what's poppin'? u been hittin' the sauce or what?”

“drinkin'? like, have i been sippin'? did i even get a chance to toss back some booze?”

“so, what got you spittin' all wild talk, huh?”

“how the heck do i talk wild, my guy?”

“how, u ask? cuz ain't u been rapping about my comeback and all that extra drama, like i dipped out for real?”

“huck—huck finn, come on, look me straight in the eye, fam; haven't u bounced already?”

“gone away? what even is that supposed to mean? i never dipped anywhere. where would i even bounce to?”

“check it out, boss, something's def off—like, is it me or who am i? am i even really here, or what? now that's the tea i need.”

“for real, i peep that u are here, no cap, but u also got that tangled brain energy, old fool jim.”

“i am? seriously, answer me this: didn't u bust out the line in the canoe to secure it to the tow-head?”

“nah, i didn't. what tow-head? i didn't clock any tow-head at all, fam.”

“u didn't see any tow-head? check it, didn't the line snap and the raft go brrr down the river, leaving you and the canoe lost in the fog?”

“what fog, tho?”

“like, duh—the fog! the same fog that's been all up in our biz all night. and didn't u whoop, and didn't i whoop, spillin' major tea about how we got scrambled among the islands—one of us getting totally lost while the other's nearly toasted cuz he had zero clue? and didn't i crash into a bunch more islands and nearly get drowned? ain't that wild, boss—ain't it legit? answer me that.”

“man, this is way too much for me, jim. i ain't peeped any fog, islands, or trouble at all. i've been chillin' here chattin' with you all night until u zonked out like ten minutes ago, and i swear i did the same. u couldn't have even gotten sloshed that quick, so fr, u've been dreamin', bro.”

“dude, seriously, how's a guy supposed to dream all that wild tea in just ten minutes?”

“dang, no cap—u totally dreamed it all, cuz none of that even went down.”

“but, huck, it's as clear as day to me that—”

“it don't matter how drippin' clear it might seem; there's literally nothing there at all. i know this cuz i've been right here the whole time.”

jim kept quiet for like five minutes, deep in thought, then dropped:
“so, i reckon i did dream it, huck; but oh my gods, damn, it was the wildest, most epic dream i ever saw. and i ain't ever had a dream before that knocked me out like this, no lie.”

“oh, well, that's cool, cuz dreams can drain a body sometimes. but this one was a straight-up hunger game of a dream—spill the deets, jim.”

so jim went off and spilled the full tea, reppin' everything as it went down, though he totally hyped it up extra. then he said he had to start interprettin' it, cuz it was like a cosmic warning drop. he said the first tow-head symbolized a dude tryin' to do us a solid, but the savage current was like another dude who'd push us away from that vibe. the whoops were sporadic alerts droppin' on us, and if we weren't dialed in to decode 'em, they'd drag us straight into bad luck instead of keepin' us safe. the whole squad of tow-heads was basically all the drama we'd face with beefy, quarrelsome peeps and shady folks, but if we stuck to our own grind and didn't talk back, we'd boss through, shake off the fog, and slide into the big, clear river—the free states—where no more cap would mess with us.
yo, it got hella dark just after i hopped on the raft, but now the vibe's clearing up again.

“alright, so that's jim's take on it, but what do all these symbols really mean?”

it's all in the trash on the raft and that busted oar—you can peep it all clear as day.

jim glanced at the mess, then at me, then back at the trash. his dream had locked in so hard that he couldn't just untangle it on the fly. but once he got his head straight, he stared me down, stone-faced and zero smiles, and said:

“what do they stand for? i'm 'bout to break it down for you. when i got wiped out from all the hustle and all that callin' for you, and then crashed, my heart was basically shattered 'cause you were missing, and i had no clue what was going down with me and the raft. then, when i woke up and found you back safe and sound, tears started droppin' and i nearly got down on my knees to kiss your foot, so mad grateful. and all you were schemin' was how to turn ole jim into a clown with a fake story. that whole mess is straight-up trash—and trash is what folks be when they throw dirt on their pals and end up feelin' mad ashamed.”

then he slowly bounced up and strolled over to the wigwam, peacin' out without droppin' another word. but that was enough—it made me feel so salty i nearly would've kissed his foot just to get him to take it back.

it took me a solid fifteen minutes to rally up the guts to go humble myself to a nay nay; but i did, and no cap, i never regretted it. i didn't pull any further shady stunts, and i wouldn't have even tried that if i knew it'd mess with his vibe.
