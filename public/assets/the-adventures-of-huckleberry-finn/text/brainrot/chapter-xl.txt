chapter xl.

yo, after a bomb breakfast, we were feeling hella chill, so i grabbed my canoe and dipped over the river to fish with a lunch packed along, having a mad good time. we even scoped out the raft and it was all Gucci, then we rolled back home late for supper—only to find the joint was in a total sweat fest, with everyone so panicky they didn’t even know which way was up. they bounced us straight to bed the minute we finished grubbin’, not spillin’ a single deet ‘bout the crisis or that fresh letter, but it was all obvious to us. once we were halfway up the stairs and had the back turned, we slid over to the cellar cupboard, hoisted a killer lunch, hauled it to our room, crashed hard, and then rolled out around half-past eleven. then tom busted out aunt sally’s dress he jacked and was ‘bout to kick off the lunch vibe when he goes:

“where’s the butter?”

“i laid a hunk of it,” i say, “on a piece of corn-pone.”

“well, you left it laid out then—it ain’t here.”

“we can roll without it,” i say.

“nah, we need it too—just slide down to the cellar and snag it. then mosey back down the lightning-rod. i’mma go stuff straw into jim’s threads to mimic his mom in disguise, get ready to ba like a sheep, and dip as soon as you land.”

so off he bounced, and i dipped down to the cellar. the butter hunk, as big as a fist, was exactly where i’d dropped it, so i grabbed that corn-pone slab with the butter on deck, snuffed out my light, and crept upstairs all stealth-mode, making it to the main floor without drama—until aunt sally stormed in with a candle. i immediately clipped my ride in my hat, re-hatted myself, and the next sec she peeped me; she goes:

“you been down in the cellar?”

“yep.”

“what you been up to down there?”

“noth’n.”

“noth’n!”

“yep.”

“then what got you going down there at this freakin’ hour?”

“i dunno.”

“you dunno? don’t hit me with that. tom, i wanna know what you been doing down there.”

“i ain’t been doing a damn thing, aunt sally, i swear.”

i figured she’d let it slide, and normally she would; but i guess with all the wild stuff going on, she was trippin’ over every little thing that wasn’t perfect. so she snapped, dead set:

“you just march into that sitting room and crash there till i come back. you been up to some shady business, and i swear i’m gonna get to the bottom of it before i’m done with you.”

so she bounced while i opened the door and slid into the sitting room. damn, there was a whole posse there! like fifteen farmers, each packing a piece, all lined up. i was hella shook, so i slunk into a chair to play it low-key. they were all gathered, some whispering in low voices, all jittery and off their game, trying to act chill—but i peeped that they were messin’ up hard, constantly doffing and redoing their hats, scratching their heads, switching seats, and fidgetin’ with their buttons. i was nervous too, but i kept my hat on, no doubt.

i legit wished aunt sally would just roll in, wrap me up, and end this drama already, let me bounce and clue tom in on how we totally overdid this whole frenzy, and what a hornet’s nest of chaos we were in—so we could stop clowning around and dip with jim before these fools’ patience snapped.

finally, she stomped back and started grillin’ me with questions, but i couldn’t spit straight answers—I was so twisted up i didn’t know which part of me was even in play; these dudes were so on edge, some ready to jump up and go full savage on them desperadoes, yelling it was just minutes to midnight; while others were begging them to hold up for that secret sheep-signal; and there was aunt sally, hammering away at questions, and me tremblin’ so bad i was ready to melt into the floor, it was that intense—plus the heat was cranked all the way up and the butter started melting, dripping down my neck and behind my ears; and soon, when one of them piped up, “i’m bout to roll into the cabin right now and nab them when they appear,” i nearly dropped; a slick trail of butter started trickling down my forehead, and aunt sally peeped it, turning as white as a ghost, and she goes:

“for the love of all that’s holy, what’s up with you, child? you’re rockin’ a straight-up brain-meltdown like you were never even born, and your brain juice is oozing out!”

and every single one of them rushed over to check, as she snatched off my hat, spilled out the bread and what was left of the butter, grabbed me, gave me a tight hug, and said:

“oh, what a flip you did on me! i’m hella relieved it ain’t worse; ‘cause luck’s totally against us, and when it rains, it pours—and when i saw that slab, i thought we’d lost you, ‘cause i knew by the color that your brains were done if—dear, dear, why didn’t you tell me that’s what you were down there for? i wouldn’t have cared one bit. now haul your ass to bed, and don’t let me see you ‘til mornin’!”

in a flash, i bounced upstairs, then down the lightning-rod in a heartbeat, creeping through the dark to the lean-to. i could barely get words out, so anxious was i; but i managed to tell tom ASAP that we had to jump for it now—no time to waste, the house was packed with dudes armed to the teeth!

his eyes straight lit up, and he goes:

“no!—is that for real? damn, huck, if i had a redo on this, i bet i could score two hundred! if we could push it off til—”

“hurry! hurry!” i bark. “where’s jim?”

“right at your elbow; stretch out and you can feel him. he’s dressed up, and everything’s set. now we’re gonna slide out and drop the sheep-signal.”

but then we peeped the heavy tramp of boots coming to the door, heard them fumbling with the padlock, and a dude shout:

“who’s that? answer me, or i’ll spray!”

but we kept it 100 and didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and dipped. next, came a mad rush, and a bang, bang, bang! bullets whizzin’ all over the place! we heard them holler:

“yo, here they are! they broke for the river! after ’em, boys, and let loose the dogs!”

so here they come, full tilt. we could hear ‘em ‘cause they were rockin’ boots and hollerin’, but we weren’t about that noise life—we were locked on the path to the mill; and when they got close enough, we dodged into the brush and let them pass, then trailed right behind. they’d had all the dogs muzzled so they wouldn’t alert the robbers; but by then someone had let those puppies off, and they came in with a pow-wow loud enough to shake the net, but they were our own dogs; so we froze until they caught up; and when they peeped it was just us, with zero hype to offer, they just gave a casual “howdy” and tore ahead towards the chaos; then we peaced up-stream again, zoomed after them nearly to the mill, and then dipped into the bush to where my canoe was tied, hopped in, and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, making as little noise as we had to. then we cruised out easy and comfortable, making tracks for the island where my raft was docked; and we could hear them yellin’ and barkin’ up and down the bank, ‘til we were so far off the sound just faded into nothing. once we stepped onto the raft, i declared:

“now, old jim, you’re free again, for real—and i bet you’ll never be a slave no more.”

“en, that job was straight-fire too, huck. it was planned on fleek, executed even more so; and nah, no one can cook up a plan as dope and bonkers as that one.”

we were all hella stoked, but tom was the happiest of all ‘cause he had a bullet chillin’ in his calf.

when jim and i peeped that, we weren’t as cocky as before. it was seriously wounding him, bleeding and hurting bad; so we laid him out in the wigwam and jacked one of the duke’s shirts to use as a bandage, but he goes:

“gimme the rags; i got this on lock. don’t even stop now; no fooling around, and this evasion is booming so smooth—man the sweeps and set her loose! bros, we pulled it off elegant-like! for real, we did. i wish we had the finesse of louis xvi—then there’d be no “son of saint louis, ascend to heaven!” scribbled in his bio; nah, sir, we’d have whooped him over the border—that’s exactly what we’d do, slick as nothing at all. man the sweeps—man the sweeps!”

but jim and i started huddling and thinking. and after a minute i said:

“say it, jim.”

so he goes:

“yo, huck, here’s how i see it. if it had been him getting all ultra-free, and one of the boys was ‘bout to get shot, would he be like, ‘go on and save me, and don’t even trip about a doctor coming to rescue me?’ like, is that what our boy mars tom would do? nah, he wouldn’t! so then, is jim really gonna spit that? nah—i ain’t budgin’ an inch outta this spot without a doctor; not even if it’s been forty freakin’ years!”

i knew he was pure white inside, and i figured he’d drop what he meant—so it was all set, and i told tom i was rolling for a doctor. he started throwing major fits about it, but jim and i stuck solid and wouldn’t move an inch; so he was ready to crawl out and set the raft loose on his own—but we weren’t having it. then he laid into us a bit, but it didn’t do a damn thing.

so when he sees me gearing up the canoe, he goes:

“alright then, if you’re bound to bounce, i’ll drop the cheat code for when you hit the village. shut the door and blindfold that doc tight and fast; make him swear to be as silent as the grave, slap a purse full of gold in his hand, then lead him around every back alley and dark corner in the hood, and then scoop him up in the canoe, taking the long way ‘round the islands, search him and jack his chalk so you don’t give it back ‘til you’re back in the village, or else he’ll just mark this raft so he can track it down later. that’s the play—everyone does it that way.”

so i was like, “bet,” and bounced, while jim was set to ghost into the woods when he peeped the doc coming, and stay hidden until he vanished.
