chapter ix.

i was like, yo, i gotta check out this spot right in the middle of the island i scoped out when exploring; so we bounced out and got there quick, ‘cause the island was only like three miles long and a quarter mile wide. this joint was basically a long, steep hill or ridge about forty feet high. getting to the top was lowkey rough—the sides were mad steep and the bushes hella thick. we trudged and climbed all over that beast, and eventually we found a sick cavern in the rock that stretched almost all the way to the top on the illinois side. the cavern was as massive as two or three rooms jammed together, and jim could actually stand up straight inside it. the vibe in there was chill. jim was all about dropping our traps in the cavern immediately, but i was like, “nah, we don’t wanna be clambering up and down all day every day.” jim said if we stash the canoe in a solid spot and hide all our traps in the cavern, we could rush back here if anyone rolled up on the island—and they wouldn’t find us without their dogs sniffin’ around. plus, he pointed out that those little birds were signaling rain, and, real talk, did i really wanna get our gear soaked?

so we dipped back to snag the canoe, then we paddle-surfed that cavern like a squad of legends, hauling all our traps in tow. next up, we scoped out a chill hidey-hole among the chunky willows to stash the boat. we snagged a few fish off the lines, reset ‘em like a reboot, and started prepping for dinner.

the cavern’s door was hella massive—big enough for a hogshead to roll in like it’s nothing—and one side had a slick little overhang, perfect for a fire pit. so yeah, we sparked one up right there and whipped dinner up like true pros.

we laid out the blankets inside, turning the floor into a makeshift red carpet for our dinner sesh, and stashed all our extra gear at the back of the cavern. no cap, darkness hit hard soon enough, with thunder booming and lightning flexing all over; the birds were low-key screaming “vibe check!” then, boom, it started pouring like mother nature was throwing the wildest rage party ever, with wind blowing like nothing i’d ever seen. it was one of those epic summer storms: so dark outside it looked all blue-black and mysteriously gorgeous; the rain pounded so thick that the trees a little ways off turned dim and crisscrossed like some busted spider-web, and then came a blast of wind that bent the trees over like they were at an extreme dance-off—next thing you know, when the storm hit its peak blue-black moment—fst!—it flipped and shined so bright you could catch a glimpse of treetops flipping around hundreds of yards away, then dipped back into darkness for a sec, and finally thunder crashed down like empty barrels rolling hard down a never-ending staircase.

"jim, these vibes are lit," i said, "i wouldn’t be chillin’ anywhere else. slide me another slab of fish and some hot cornbread, no cap."

"bro, you wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for jim. you’d be out there in the woods starving and almost drowning, facts. even the chickens are on that rain-signal vibe, just like the birds, bruh."

the river kept flexin’ and rising for like ten or twelve days straight until it totally smashed the banks. on the low ground, the water was about three or four feet deep on the island and the illinois bottom, stretching mad miles wide on one side, but on the missouri side it stayed a chill half-a-mile wide ‘cause the shore was just a wall of high, savage bluffs.

by day, we cruised all over the island in our canoe, soaking up that cool, shady deep-woods life even when the sun was straight-up blazing. we zigzagged amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines were so extra that we had to back off and pick another route. real talk, every busted tree hosted rabbits, snakes, and other critters; and after the island got flooded for a day or two, the animals got so hangry they were practically tame—you could low-key reach out and pet a rabbit if you fancied it (but not the snakes and turtles, they’d slide off into the water). the ridge where our cavern chilled was crawling with them; we could’ve started a petting zoo if we wanted.

one night, we copped a sweet piece of a lumber raft—solid pine planks all around. it was like twelve feet wide and about fifteen or sixteen feet long, with the top chilling six or seven inches above the water—a level, dope floor. sometimes in daylight, we peeped saw-logs drifting by, but we let ‘em slide; we were never about that daylight life.

another night at the head of the island, just before dawn, a sketchy two-story frame-house showed up on the west side, crooked as heck. we paddled over, clambered aboard through an upstairs window, but it was still pitch black, so we locked down the canoe and chilled, waiting for daylight to drop.

as the glow of morning began before we even hit the island’s base, we peeped into an upstairs window. inside, we could just make out a bed, a table, a couple of rundown chairs, and a load of random stuff scattered on the floor, with clothes casually hanging on the wall. in the far corner, something that looked like a dude was lying there. so jim goes:

"yo, you there!"

but nothing happened. i hollered again, and then jim goes:

"this dude ain’t snoozin’—he’s straight-up dead. stay put, i’ll go check."

jim rolled over, bent down to scope it out, and announced:

"it's a dead man, for real—naked as heck, too. he got shot in the back, no cap. i reckon he's been dead like two or three days. come in, huck, but don’t even peek at his face—it’s too freaky."

i didn’t even glance at him. jim tossed some old rags over the body—though he didn’t need to, since i was totally not into the sight. the floor was littered with greasy old cards, dusty whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made from black cloth; and all over the walls were the dumbest scribbled words and charcoal doodles. there were two grimy calico dresses, a sun-bonnet, some women’s undies hanging on the wall, and even some menswear. we loaded all that random loot into the canoe—maybe it’d score us some cash later. there was also an old speckled straw hat from a kid on the floor, so i snagged that. plus, there was a milk bottle with a rag stopper for a baby to suck on, but it was busted. there was a seedy old chest and an ancient hair trunk with broken hinges—they were open, but nothing of any real value was left inside. by the way everything was scattered, it was clear these peeps bounced in a mad rush and didn’t pack up their stuff right.

we scored some extra gear too: an old tin lantern, a butcher-knife with no handle, a brand-new barlow knife worth a couple bits at any store, a stash of tallow candles, a tin candlestick, a gourd, a tin cup, a ratty old bedquilt from the bed, and a reticule loaded with needles, pins, beeswax, buttons, thread—basically a whole bundle of random junk. then there was a hatchet, some nails, a fishline as thick as my little finger with monstrous hooks, a roll of buckskin, a leather dog-collar, a horseshoe, and some vials of unmarked medicine. as we were bouncin’ out, i copped a solid curry-comb, and jim snagged a ratty old fiddle-bow and even a wooden leg. the leg’s straps were busted off, but aside from that it was decent—though too long for me and too short for jim—and we never found the matching one despite scouring everywhere.

all in all, we made a pretty dope haul. when it was time to dip, we were about a quarter-mile below the island and it was broad daylight; so i made jim lie low in the canoe under the quilt, ‘cause if he popped up, folks would peep he was a nay nay from a mile away. i paddled off to the illinois shore, drifting about half a mile, creeping up the dead water under the bank with zero drama. we got home safe, for real.
