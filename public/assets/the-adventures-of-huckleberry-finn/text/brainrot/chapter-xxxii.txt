chapter xxxii.

when i rolled up there, it was all chill and sunday-mode, blazing hot and mad sunshiny; the folks were all out in the fields; and there was this low-key drone from bugs and flies buzzing in the air that made it feel hella lonely, like everyone had already dipped. and if a breeze rolled by, shaking the leaves, it gave off a serious melancholy vibe—as if ancient spirits were lowkey whisperin’ secrets, dead for centuries and always dissin’ you. overall, it was the kind of vibe that makes a body wish it could just yeet itself outta this endless nightmare.

phelps’s was one of those one-horse cotton plantations, all cut from the same cloth. there was a rail fence around a two-acre yard; a makeshift log stile, all sawed off and flipped into uneven steps—like mismatched barrels to help you hop the fence, and for the ladies to perch on when jumpin’ on a horse; some scraggly patches of grass in the yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat that lost all its fluff; a big double log house for the white homies—hewed logs with the gaps patched up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes got whitewashed every now and then; a round-log kitchen with a wide, open but roofed passage hooking it up to the house; a log smokehouse behind the kitchen; three tiny log nay nay-cabins lined up on the other side of the smokehouse; one lonely hut all by itself down against the back fence, and some shed-like outbuildings on the flip side; an ash-hopper and a massive kettle for cooking soap right by that little hut; a bench by the kitchen door with a bucket of water and a gourd; a hound catching z’s in the sun; more hounds snoozing around; about three shady trees chillin’ in a corner; some currant and gooseberry bushes near the fence; outside the fence, a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields started up, and after that, the woods.

i bounced around and clambered over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started edging toward the kitchen. after a bit, i caught the low-key hum of a spinning-wheel whining on and off like it was stuck in a sad remix; and in that moment, i legit wished i was ghost—no cap, that sound was the epitome of loneliness.

i just kept rollin’, no strict plan, just trusting that providence would slide the perfect words into my mouth when my time came; i always noticed providence drops the right vibes if you just let it do its thing.

when i was about halfway through, first one hound then another popped off and ran at me, so i froze, facing ‘em like a statue. and damn, the pack went off! in like a quarter minute, i found myself surrounded like a hub made of dog spokes—about fifteen of ‘em all packed tight around me, noses and necks craned up, barking and howling like they were at a rave; and more kept rolling in—you could see ‘em sailing over fences and rounding corners from every direction.

then a nay nay woman burst out of the kitchen, clutching a rolling-pin like it was her lifetime prop, yelling, “begone you tige! you spot! begone sah!” she clapped one after another, sending them howling, and then half of them boomeranged back, wagging their tails around me and lowkey making friends. no harm in a hound, really.

right after, a little nay nay girl and two tiny nay nay boys—rockin’ nothing but tow-linen shirts—clung tight to their mama’s gown, peeking out shyly at me like it was their usual routine. then, a white woman, probably around forty-five or fifty and rocking no hair with her spinning-stick in hand, came sprinting out from the house; trailing her were her little white kids, acting just like those little nay nays. she was grinning so wide it was unreal—and she goes:

  “it’s you, at last!—ain’t it?”

i blurted out a “yes’m” before my brain could even catch up.

she grabbed me and squeezed me tight, then clutched both my hands and shook me like she was on a dance challenge, tears rolling down her face, and she just couldn’t stop—a continuous hug-shake fest—while saying, “you don’t look as much like your mom as i thought you would; but law sakes, i don’t even care, i’m so stoked to see you! damn, i could just eat you up! kids, it’s your cousin tom!—tell him howdy.”

but the kids ducked their heads, stuck their fingers to their lips, and hid behind her. so she kept on:

  “lize, hustle up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you snag your breakfast on the boat?”

i was like, “i already grubbed on the boat.” then she bounced for the house, leading me by the hand with the kids tagging along. when we rolled in, she plopped me down in a split-bottomed chair, sat herself on a low stool right in front of me, holding both my hands, and goes:

  “now i can peep you proper; and, no lie, i’ve been craving this moment for ages, and it’s finally here! we’ve been waiting on you for days. what held you up?—was the boat stuck?”

“yes’m—she—”

“don’t say yes’m—say aunt sally. where’d she get stuck?”

i didn’t really know what to say, cuz i wasn’t sure if the boat was coming up the river or down. but i ride on my gut a lot; and my gut said she’d be coming up—from the down vibes toward orleans. that didn’t help much, though, cuz i wasn’t clued in on the bar names down that route. i figured i had to either make up a bar or forget the real name of the one we got stuck on—or—then a brainwave hit, and i dropped it:

  “it wasn’t the grounding—that only slowed us down a bit. we straight-up blew a cylinder-head.”

“good gracious! anybody get hurt?”

“no’m. killed a nay nay.”

“well, it’s lucky; cuz sometimes people do get wrecked. two years ago last christmas, your uncle silas was cruisin’ up from newrleans on the old lally rook, and she blew a cylinder-head and totally wrecked a dude. and i think he died after that. he was a baptist, ya know. your uncle silas was tight with a fam in baton rouge that knew his peeps real well. yup, i remember—he did die. total mortification hit, and they even had to amputate him. but that didn’t save him. yep, it was all about that mortification—no cap. he turned blue all over and died, still hoping for some epic resurrection vibes. word is, he was a wild sight. your uncle’s been hitting town every day to scoop you up. and he bounced again, not more than an hour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. you must’ve peeped him on the road, right?—old school dude, with a—”

“no, i didn’t peep anyone, aunt sally. the boat landed right at daylight, and i ditched my baggage on the wharf-boat and cruised around town and out in the country to kill time so i wouldn’t roll in too early; so i came through the back way.”

“who did you offload the baggage with?”

“nobody.”

“child, it’s gonna get jacked!”

“nah, i reckon it won’t, cuz i hid it tight,” i say.

“how’d you snag breakfast so early on the boat?”

it was like walkin’ on thin ice, but i reply:

“the captain peeped me chillin’ and was like, ‘you better munch before you hit land,’ so he scooped me into the texas with the officers’ lunch and hooked me up with all i wanted.”

i was getting mad uneasy and couldn’t even focus. my brain was all on the kids; i wanted to scoop ‘em aside, vibe with them, and figure out who i was. but i couldn’t get any scoop as mrs. phelps kept on goin’. pretty soon, she sent cold chills down my spine as she goes:

  “but listen up, we’re rollin’ this way and you haven’t dropped a word about sis or any of them. now i’m gonna take a breather, and you spill yours; just break it all down—tell me everything about every single one—how they’re doin’, what they’re up to, and what they told you to pass on; every last deet you got.”

well, i was totally stumped—like, seriously stuck. providence had been chillin’ with me up until then, but now i was hella cornered. i figured pushin’ on was useless—I had to throw up my hands. so i thought, “here’s another moment to risk dropping the truth.” i cracked my mouth open to spill, but she grabbed me and hustled me behind the bed, and goes:

  “here he comes! tuck your head down—yeah, that’s it; you gotta stay low-key. don’t let on you’re here. i’m gonna play a prank on him. kids, zip it—don’t say a word.”

i knew i was in a tight fix now. but no point in stressing; i just had to stay still and be ready to bounce when the lightning struck.

i caught just a quick glimpse of the old gentleman when he popped in; then the bed shadowed him. mrs. phelps jumped up for him and goes:

  “has he come?”

“no,” says her husband.

  “goodness gracious! what the heck happened to him?”

“i can’t even picture it,” the old gentleman says, “and not gonna lie, it’s got me hella uneasy.”

“uneasy!” she goes, “i’m about to lose it! he must roll in; and you totally missed him along the road. i know it—something’s screaming that he’s here.”

“why, sally, i couldn’t have missed him on the road—you know that.”

“but oh, dear, dear, what will sis say! he must be here! you gotta have missed him. he—”

“oh, don’t stress me out even more—I’m already wrecked. i don’t know what to make of it. i’m at my wit’s end, and i’m straight-up scared. but there’s zero chance he’s here; he couldn’t roll in and i miss him. sally, it’s absolutely tragic—just tragic—something went down with the boat, for sure!”

“why, silas! peep over there!—up the road!—ain’t that someone coming?”

he shot up to the window at the head of the bed, which gave mrs. phelps her opening. she quickly stooped at the foot of the bed and tugged me out, and boom, i was out; and when he turned back from the window, there she was, beaming and smiling like a house on fire, and there i was, standing all meek and sweaty beside her. the old gentleman just stared, and goes:

  “whoa, who’s that?”

  “who do you reckon it is?”

  “i ain’t got no clue. who is it?”

  “it’s tom sawyer!”

by jings, i nearly dropped through the floor! but there wasn’t time for any smack talk; the old man grabbed my hand and shook it non-stop, while the woman danced around, laughing and crying like crazy; and then they both started firing off questions about sid, and mary, and the rest of the fam.

but if they were all hyped, it didn’t even compare to how i was feelin’—it was like a total rebirth, i was so stoked to remember who i was. they grilled me for nearly two hours; and by the time my chin was so done it could barely function, i’d spilled more about my family—the sawyer family—than any six sawyer fams ever did. i even broke down how we blew a cylinder-head at the mouth of the white river, and it took us three whole days to fix it. which was chill and worked like a dream; 'cause they all thought only three days could fix it. if i’d called it a bolthead, it would’ve done just as rad.

now i was riding high on one side but feeling hella off on the other. being tom sawyer was, like, a total breeze and comfy, until suddenly i heard a steamboat coughing its way down the river. then i was like, “yo, what if tom sawyer rolls in on that boat? and what if he steps in any minute and drops my name before i can even wink him to zip it? that just won’t fly—it wouldn’t do at all. i gotta hit the road and intercept him. so i told the crew that i’d bounce to town and scoop my baggage. the old gentleman wanted to roll with me, but i was like, ‘nah, i got this—i can ride the horse solo, and i’d rather not have him hassle me.’”
