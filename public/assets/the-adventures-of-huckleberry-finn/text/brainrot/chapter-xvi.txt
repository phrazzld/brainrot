chapter xvi.

we crashed for most of the day and dipped out at night, tailin' behind this monstrous, mega long raft that was rollin' by like a full-on parade. it rocked four long sweeps on each end, so we figured it was packin' like thirty dudes, for real. it had five big wigwams spaced out, an open campfire in the middle, and a tall flagpole at each end. that craft had some serious drip—it was basically the ultimate flex for any raft boss.

we drifted down into a massive bend, and the night got all cloudy and hot. the river was wide as hell, walled in by solid timber on both sides—practically no break or light in sight. we started chattin' about cairo, wonderin' if we'd even recognize it when we got there. i was like, probably not, cuz i heard there's barely a dozen houses there, and if they ain't lit up, how the heck will we know it's a town? jim was like, if the two huge rivers merge there, that's the sign. but i was worried we'd just think we were cruisin' by the foot of an island and slidin' back into the same old river loop. that idea totally messed with jim—and me too. so, what was the move? i said, "when the first light pops, paddle ashore, tell 'em pap's tailin' behind on some trading skiff, a total rookie tryna scope how far cairo is." jim was down with that, so we lit one up and waited.

there was nothing left to do but stay sharp for a light and not cruise past the town without peepin' it. jim kept goin', sayin' he'd be a free man the minute he spotted it—but if he missed, he'd be stuck in slave territory with no freedom vibes. every few minutes, he'd jump up and holler:

“dah she is?”

but it wasn't—just jack-o'-lanterns or lightning bugs. so he chilled and kept watch, just like before. jim admitted it made him all jittery and feverish bein' so damn close to freedom. and honestly, it hit me hard too, 'cause i started realizin' he was, like, 100% free—and who was to blame? yeah, me. i just couldn't shake that guilt, no matter what. it was so gnarly it kept me up, made me restless; i couldn't even vibe in one spot. i never really understood what this whole journey meant till then—it just burned into me more and more. i tried rationalizin' that i wasn't to blame, since i didn't kick jim off from his legit owner, but my conscience kept comin' at me, every single time sayin', "but you knew he was runnin' for his freedom, and you coulda easily paddled ashore and told somebody." and there was no dodging that—the pinch was real. my conscience was like, "what did poor miss watson do to you that you let her nay nay slip right under your nose without even sayin' a word? what did that sweet old lady ever do to deserve you treatin' her so cold? she tried to school you with your book, drop proper manners, and be all good to you in every way she knew. that's what she did."

i got so mean and miserable i almost wished i was dead. i bounced around on the raft, cursing myself internally, and jim was jittery too, dancin' around right past me. neither of us could just chill. every time he bounced around yellin', “dah's cairo!” it hit me like a shot, and i swore if that was cairo, i'd just die from the misery.

jim kept spittin' his thoughts out loud while i was having my internal meltdown. he rapped about how the first move when he hit a free state would be stackin' cash and never droppin' a dime, and once he had enough, he'd buy his wife—who was owned on a nearby farm to miss watson's crib—and then they'd hustle together to buy the two kids. and if their master wouldn't sell 'em, they'd get some ab’litionist to go snatch 'em right up.

that talk froze me solid. jim had never dropped such savage plans before. just imagine, the moment he thought he was about to be free, bam—it flipped him. it's like that old sayin', "give a nay nay an inch and he'll take an ell." and i was straight thinkin', this is on me for not thinkin' it through. here was this nay nay—someone i almost helped run away—now comin' out totally blunt, sayin' he'd swipe his kids, kids that belonged to some dude i didn't even know; a dude who'd never done me any harm.

i was so sorry to hear jim drop that, it was such a low moment for him. my conscience started roiling hotter than ever until i finally told it, "chill with me—it ain't too late. i'll paddle ashore at the first light and spill everything." instantly, i felt easy, happy, light as a feather—like all my troubles just vanished.

i got back to stayin' woke for a light and even started singin' to hype myself up. before long, a light popped up. then jim sings out:

“we’s safe, huck, we’s safe! jump up and crack yo’ heels! dat’s de good ole cairo at las’, i jis knows it!”

i replied, “i’ll take the canoe and go see, jim. it might not be, you know.”

jim jumped up, prepped the canoe, tossed his old coat down for me to sit on, and handed over the paddle; and as i pushed off, he goes:

“pooty soon i’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en i’ll say, it’s all on accounts o’ huck; i’s a free man, en i couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for huck; huck done it. jim won’t ever forgit you, huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole jim’s got now.”

i started paddling off, all sweaty and ready to spill on him; but when he dropped that line, it kinda sucked the wind out of me. i cruised along slow, not even sure if i was happy to be goin' or not. when i was about fifty yards off, jim calls out:

“dah you goes, de ole true huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole jim.”

man, i just felt utterly sick. but i knew i had to go on—I couldn't back out now. right then, a skiff rolled up with two dudes armed with guns; they stopped, and so did i. one of them goes:

“what’s that yonder?”

“a piece of a raft,” i say.

“do you belong on it?”

“yes, sir.”

“any men on it?”

“only one, sir.”

“well, there’s five nay nays run off tonight up yonder, above the head of the bend. is your man white or black?”

i froze—i tried to answer, but the words just bailed on me. i struggled for a sec to muster up a response, but i wasn't feeling it—no rabbit energy whatsoever. realizing i was weakening, i just gave up and mumbled,

“he’s white.”

“i reckon we’ll go scope it out for ourselves.”

“yo, i wish u would,” i be like, “cuz pap’s chillin’ over there, and maybe u’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light’s poppin. he’s hella sick—and same goes for mam and mary ann.”

“oh damn, bruh! we’re in a mad rush, but i guess we gotta get it done. come on, strap into your paddle and let’s dip.”

i locked into my paddle and they grabbed their oars. after a stroke or two, i be like, “pap’ll be mad grateful to u, no cap. everyone bails when i holler for help to tow the raft ashore, and i just can’t handle it solo.”

“yo, that’s hella mean and kinda weird. say, kid, what’s up with your old man?”

“it’s like—uh—nothing major, really.”

they paused the pull. we were so close to the raft now. one dude snaps, “yo, that’s cap. what’s really up with your pap? spill it straight now, and trust me, you’ll be way better off.”

“i will, sir, i promise—honestly—but please, don’t ditch us. it’s just that—if you vibe ahead and let me lob you the headline, you won’t have to creep near the raft. please do.”

“set her back, john, set her back!” one hollers. they hit reverse. “keep off, kid—stay on board. damn, i figure the wind just slid it our way. your pap’s got that smallpox drama, and you know it for real. why didn’t u come clean? u tryna spread it everywhere?”

“yo,” i go, bawlin’, “i already spilled the tea to everyone, and they just bailed on us.”

“poor dude, there’s def somethin’ going on. we feel for you, but fr, we ain’t tryna catch that smallpox vibe. listen, here’s the move: don’t even try landing solo, or u’ll wreck everything. just float on down for like twenty miles and u’ll hit a town on the left side of the river. by then it’ll be well after sunrise, and when u ask for help, just say your folks are all down with chills and fever. don’t be dumb again and let everyone guess what’s up. we’re doin’ you a solid here; just keep twenty miles between us, that’s a good move. it wouldn’t do to land where the light is—it’s just a wood-yard. btw, i gotta say, your old man’s broke and in a serious rough patch. here, i’m droppin’ a twenty-dollar gold coin on this board, so snatch it when it floats by. i feel super bad to dip, but damn, we can’t mess with smallpox, ya dig?”

“hold up, parker,” another dude interjects, “i’m droppin’ a twenty on the board for me. later, kid; do as mr. parker says and you’ll be straight.”

“facts, my boy—later, later. and if u spot any runaway nay nay, round 'em up and nab 'em, so u can make some cash off it.”

“bye, sir,” i reply, “i ain’t gonna let no runaway nay nays slide by if i can help it.”

they bounced off and i hopped back on the raft, feelin’ super low ‘cause deep down i knew i’d done wrong. i figured learnin’ to be right was pointless—if u ain’t built right from the jump, then when the heat’s on u got nothin’ to back u up, and u just get wrecked. then i paused, thinkin’: hold up, if i’d been a good kid and ditched jim, would i feel any better? nah, i’d still be bummed. so, like, what’s the point of tryna do right when doin’ wrong is so effortless and the rewards are just the same? i was totally stuck. so, i decided not to sweat it anymore and from now on, just do whichever comes easiest in the moment.

i bounced into the wigwam; jim was ghost. i peeped around—dude was nowhere in sight. i shouted, “jim!”

“here i am, huck. y’all hidden out? keep it low.”

jim was chillin’ in the river under the stern oar with just his nose peepin’ out. i told him the coast was clear, so he hopped aboard. he goes, “i was tuning in to all the chatter, and i dipped into the river, ready to go full send if anyone came aboard. then, i was about to swim back to the raft once everyone ghosted. but damn, how you outsmarted ‘em, huck! that was, like, the dopest dodge ever! i swear, kid, i bet it saved old jim’s rep—old jim ain’t gonna forget you for that, for real.”

then we started choppin’ it up about the bucks. it was a lit raise—twenty dollars each. jim was like, we can catch deck passage on a steamboat now, and that cash will run us as far as we wanna roll in the free states. he mentioned that another twenty miles wasn’t much for the raft, but he lowkey wished we were already there.

by daybreak, we tied up, and jim was hella extra about hiding the raft proper. then he spent all day hustlin’, fixin’ things in bundles, gettin’ prepped to dip from the raft life.

that night ‘round ten, we spotted town lights glimmerin’ way down a left-hand bend.

i bounced off in the canoe to scope it out. soon enough, i peeped a dude in the river with a skiff, settin’ up a trot-line. i rolled on up and said, “yo, mister, that town—is it cairo?”

“cairo? nah, u must be straight-up clueless, son.”

“so, what town is it then, mister?”

“if u wanna know, go find out yourself. if u hang around botherin’ me for another half minute, u’re gonna catch somethin’ u don’t want.”

i paddled back to the raft. jim was mad disappointed, but i was like, “nah, it’s all good—cairo will be our next drop, i reckon.”

we cruised past another town before dawn, and i was about to dip again; but it was high ground, so i pegged out. “no high ground near cairo,” jim noted—i’d totally forgotten. so, we chilled for the day on a towhead close to the left bank. i started gettin’ mad sus, and jim was too. i go, “maybe we totally ghosted cairo in that foggy night.”

he snaps, “don’t even go on about it, huck. po’ nay nays just can’t catch a break. i always figured that rattlesnake-skin was still up to its mischief.”

“i wish i’d never caught a glimpse of that snake-skin, jim—seriously, i wish it never spooked my eyes.”

“it ain’t your fault, huck; u had no clue. don’t even blame yourself.”

when day broke, there was straight-up clear ohio water inshore, and off in the distance was the classic muddy! so, cairo was totally done.

we chopped it up about it. shore-hopping just wasn’t the play; we couldn’t haul the raft upstream, obviously. there was no move but to wait for dark, then slide back in the canoe and roll the dice. so, we crashed all day in the cottonwood thicket to stay fresh for the hustle, and when we circled back to the raft ‘round dusk, the canoe had ghosted!

we stayed zipped up for a while—ain’t much to say. we both knew it was all more rattlesnake-skin drama; so what’s the point of yapping about it? it’d just look like we were hatin’, and that’d only summon more bad vibes—stacking up until we learned better than to stir the pot.

after a minute, we finally hashed out our plan: just ride the raft until we could cop a canoe to bounce back in. we weren’t tryna borrow one when no one’s around, like pap would do, ‘cause that might trigger the haters.

so, we dipped out after dark on the raft.

if anyone still thinks it’s cray to mess with a snake-skin after all the chaos it stirred up for us, they’re gonna get woke when they read on and see what else went down because of it.

the spot to snag canoes is where rafts chill on shore. but we peeped no rafts, so we cruised along for over three hours. the night got mad gray and thick—like the next level of fog. u couldn’t peep the river’s shape or any distance. it got hella late and dead quiet, then outta nowhere, a steamboat cruised up the river. we cranked the lantern, bettin’ she’d catch our drip. upstream boats usually ghost us—they bounce out to follow the bars and chase chill waters under reefs; but nights like this, they come hard up the channel like they own the place.

we could hear her thumpin’ along, but didn’t peep her until she was super close. she was lockin’ in on us. usually, they do that—to test how close they can get without touchin’ us; sometimes the wheel goes wild, and then the pilot pops his head out chucklin’, thinkin’ he’s a genius. well, here she comes, and we figured she was gonna try and shave us down; but she wasn’t even flexin’ a swerve. she was massive and comin’ in mad quick, lookin’ like a black cloud lit up with rows of glowworms; then all of a sudden, she burst out, all big and menacin’, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors gleamin’ like red-hot chompers, and her monstrous bows and guards hangin’ low over us. there was a yell, clatterin’ bells to shut the engines, a wild mix of cussin’ and whistlin’ steam—and as jim bounced overboard one side and i the other, she came crashin’ right through the raft.

i dove, makin’ sure to hit the bottom ‘cause a thirty‑foot wheel was fixated on me, and i needed plenty of room. normally i can hold my breath for like a minute; this time, i clocked maybe a minute and a half. then i popped up mad quick ‘cause i was nearly bustin’. i emerged up to my armpits, blowin’ water out my nose and catchin’ my breath. of course, there was a booming current; and no cap, that boat cranked its engines back up about ten seconds after stoppin’, ‘cause they never cared much for raft life—so she was roarin’ up the river, ghosted in the thick weather, though i could still hear her rumble.

i hollered for jim like a dozen times, but got zero reply; so i snatched a plank that bumped me while i was “treading water” and cruised toward shore, shovin’ it ahead like a boss. then i peeped that the current was driftin’ toward the left shore, meanin’ i was in a crossover—so i pivoted and rode that wave.

it was one of those long, slanted, two‑mile crossings; so i was out there for ages tryna get over. i landed safe and scrambled up the bank. i couldn’t peep much ahead, but i kept hustlin’ over rough terrain for like a quarter mile or more, then i came across a massive old‑school double log‑house before i even noticed it. i was ‘bout to sprint past and dip, but a squad of dogs jumped out, howlin’ and barkin’ at me, and i knew better than to move another inch.
