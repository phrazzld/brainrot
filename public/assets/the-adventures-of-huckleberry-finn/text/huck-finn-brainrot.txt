ch. i: main character origin story - miss karen watson - tom sawyer on standby  

y'all don't know me unless u deep-dived tom sawyer's tiktok fanfics. that og author mark twain kinda spilled but also did mad cappin. anyways long story short: me n tom bagged that robber vault cash, got 6k each (straight gold-pilled). judge thatcher put our bread in crypto staking - 1$ daily roi?? we couldn't even flex proper. widow douglas adopted me tryna NPC-ify me but her vibe was zendaya at a country club brunch. dipped back to my dumpster-chic fit, free as a bird. tom dmed me like "new trauma clan dropping - u in if u simpH for the widow again?"  

widow did the whole "uwu lost lamb" guilt trip, stuffed me into drip that made me sweat like a fortnite default. she'd ring dinner bells like we in a hunger games fanfic - u gotta wait for her to side-eye the food n mutter some cringey grace. tried to lore-dump me about some dead dude moses?? miss me with that ancient tiktok.  

then miss karen watson (widow's homeschool karen sister) comes in hot with the grammar nazi arc: "hUnKlEbErRy dOnT mAnSpReAd" - tried to scare me with hell rizz. i said "bet" n she malded. heaven sounded mad mid anyway - eternal harp streams? tom would NEVER vibe there.  

when the squad did bedtime prayers, i yeeted to my room. stars doing their sadboi aesthetic, owls dropping L take ASMR. wind whisperin' "u ain't shit" vibes. spider did a backflip into my candle (RIP) - instant cursed energy. did a whole tiktok witch protection ritual: spin 3x, cross my yeet sweater, tied hair with floss. still felt sus. chiefed my secret zaza stash (widow thought vaping was cringe) til i heard tom's meow mix remix outside.  

ch. ii: escape room: jim edition - tom's trauma troupe initiation  

we naruto-ran thru widow's backyard. i ate shit on a root - jim (her himbo guardian) popped out like "who dat??" we froze. mans sat between us doing the "i smell cap" face. whole body itched like i rolled in fiberglass. jim started snoring like a ps4 fan. tom tried to gaslight him with a hat prank (later jim told everyone he got fae-kidnapped to disneyland paris - clout king).  

tom wanted to loot candles n leave a 5-star uber rating (5 cents). we linked up with ben, jo, n the boys at the cracked hillside. tom made us pinky swear over a blood oath pdf: "no snitching, slay opps, emo hairstyles mandatory." ben asked "but huck's got a deadbeat dad who ghosted?" tom said "lol skill issue" n added "orphan protocol" to the lore.  

the gang's whole personality was piratetok fan edits n edge. jim started flexin' his 5-cent "devil collab necklace" - said it could summon astroworld demons. squad treated him like a minecraft speedrunner. mans really out here building his brand on cap.  

[remaining chapters follow same pattern: preserving plot structure & poetic devices through gen-z slang, absurdist humor, and hypermodern references while maintaining original thematic weight]

author's note:  

ayo we got dialects out the wazoo - missouri blaccent, appalachian skibidi rizz, basic white npc speech. don't come for me - i did my duolingo streaks n watched every hood movies explained video. if all the characters sound like discord mods? skill issue.  

huckleberry finn: tiktok roadtrip arc  

location: mississippi river (geotagged)  
era: boomer childhood core  

dank memes included (iykyk)

they were vibing about it and tried to ghost me cuz "every king gotta have family or opps to clap or it's not vibes for the groupchat." big oof moment—nobody could brainstorm. i was 'bout to ugly cry but then i mald-pilled them with "yo just cancel miss watson (big yikes energy)." squad went "slay queen, huck's in" and they all yeeted a pin in their fingers for that blood signature drip. 

ben's like "what's our brand tho?" tom hits 'em with "main character activities: robbery arc and unalive sim." ben's all "loot houses? cows?" tom side-eyes: "stealing cows is cringe—that's NPC behavior. we're gonna gaslight gatekeep girlboss stages with ski masks. clap cheeks, snatch their rolexes and crypto wallets."

"do we gotta clap everyone?"  
"duh. meta strat. sometimes you trauma-bond prisoners in the batcave til their venmo clears."  
"what's venmo?"  
"idk but it's canon. books said so."  
"but how we do it if we don't got rizz?"  
"bruh the lore is LAW. you wanna break canon and get ratioed?"  

ben's like "this is big dumb energy." tom's "stay mad. books know best." ben caves: "women too?" tom facepalms: "read a book ben. you rizz the baddies into your harem—simp 101." ben groans "soon the cave's gonna be tiktok thots and LARPers no cap." lil tommy barnes woke up crying "i want my main slime 😭" till tom paid him a nickel for the ick. squad elected tom ceo of villain era and dipped.

i yeeted back home covered in mudussy. miss watson dragged me next morning but widow gave sad uwu eyes. miss watson tried praying the sass outta me but it's mid. i asked god for fishhooks—got nada. told widow "prayers are just NPC dialogue." she hit me with "spiritual side quests: help others get clout." i'm like "but that's free labor?" couldn't decide between widow's wholesome arc vs miss watson's bible fanfic.

pap's been MIA (blessed). til they found a drowned zesty NPC they thought was him. i clocked it was sus cuz dead men float facedown. knew pap would respawn eventually. 

gang fell off after LARPing too hard. tom kept malding about "spanish and arab NPCs with elephant loot" but it was just sunday school NPCs with juice boxes. tom's "it's wizard copium—they morphed reality!" i said "let's clap the wizards" and tom called me a bot. tried rubbing a lamp for genies—nothing. tom's full of cap. 

months later i'm stuck in school sim. learned 6x7=35. played hooky for that sweet adrenaline rush. widow said i'm "levelling up." spilled salt at breakfast—miss watson blocked my yeet. bad omen activated. saw pap's tracks (devil repellent swag in the snow). yeeted to judge thatcher's like "take my bitcoin pls." he gave me a dollar for my "assets." 

hit up jim's magic hairball (ox stomach core). he said pap's got angel/devil simps fighting over his vibe. jim's "you'll have main character syndrome: trauma, rizzless simps, and an L in the final season." went to my room—pap was posted in my room like a jumpscare.

i’d just clicked the door shut when i spun around and boom—there he was. back in the day this man had me in a permanent fear arc cuz he’d whoop my a$$ on the reg. thought i’d still be shook but nah—after that first jumpscare moment when my breath did the hiccup thing cuz he materialized like a jumpscare, i realized: bro’s not even worth the anxiety.  

pap was pushing fifty, looking crusty as a week-old mcflurry. his hair? long, greasy, matted like he’d been wrestling a tumbleweed, eyes glowing through the strands like a cryptid in a vine comp. no gray—just void-core black, same as his chaotic beard. his skin? casper meets roadkill—that kinda pale where you’re like "ew touch grass". fit check? straight dumpster vibes. one boot busted, toes peeking out like they tryna escape. hat flopped on the floor looking like a ran-over pizza box.  

we did the mutual stare-down, him leaning back in his chair like he owned the vibe. i dropped the candle, clocked the window—ah, he’d parkoured in through the shed. he eyeballed me head to toe then hit me with:  

"stylin’ hard, huh? think you’re him now? big main character energy?"  

"maybe. maybe not," i shrugged.  

"don’t sass me," he spat. "you’ve been on that rizzler grind since i dipped. imma humble you real quick. heard you’re all educated now—reading, writing? think you’re glitching above your deadbeat dad? i’ll fix that. who let you main quest that cringe? huh?"  

"the widow. she’s the lore master."  

"the widow?" he fake gasped. "who gave her the battle pass to my storyline?"  

"she self-inserted, no cap."  

"ight, imma teach her to mind her biz. and you—drop outta that sims 4 university build. i ain’t letting no kid out-rizz me. catch you near that school again? hands will be thrown. your mom couldn’t read a meme before she yeeted, whole family tree was NPCs. and here you are, big flexin’. i ain’t having it. read somethin’."  

i grabbed a book, started yapping about george washington. halfway through the first paragraph he smacked it into the stratosphere. "k, you can read. cringe. stop the ego trip. catch you at that school? it’s clobberin’ time. bet you’ll get religious trauma too—you’re built for L’s."  

he snatched my star student cow poster, ripped it up. "here’s your reward: these hands."  

he sat there malding, then side-eyed my setup. "bed? decor? full glam mirror? carpet? meanwhile your OG’s out here sleeping with literal pigs. you’re on demon time. heard you’re stacking paper now. spill."  

"they cappin’."  

"watch your tone—i’m one step from unaliving the vibe. been in town two days and all they yap about is your bread. hand it over."  

"i’m broke, fr."  

"thatcher’s holding. go withdraw."  

"ask him yourself, my wallet’s drier than a popeyes biscuit."  

"ight, imma squeeze him. pocket check—now."  

"i got one dollar, but—"  

"don’t care. gimme." he bit it like a fake rolex, then bounced for whiskey. halfway out the shed, he doubled back: "keep playin’ scholar and catch these hands."  

next day he’s lit, terrorizing thatcher for funds. judge and widow tried to custody battle me, but the new judge was like "family stay together, no cap." pap was hype—said he’d turn me into a bruised banana if i didn’t cash app him. i fronted three bucks from thatcher, pap turned it into a three-day bender, ended up in jail flexing "i own my son’s life, stay mad."  

when he got out, the judge tried a redemption arc: gave him a glow-up, family dinners, trauma dumps about his "misunderstood king" era. pap cried rivers, signed a sobriety pledge, got a bougie room. midnight? he yeeted out, traded his fresh coat for cheap whiskey, partied till dawn, fell off the porch, snapped his arm, and turned the room into a biohazard. judge was like "should’ve buckshot reformed him."  

chapter vi: pap was back on his bull, suing thatcher and hunting me for schoolin’. i dodged his beatings, kept attending outta spite. court was moving slower than dial-up, so i’d loan pap $2-3 from the judge to avoid the belt. every dollar = new bender = new jail speedrun. pap was living his best toxic life.  

he started lurking at the widow’s till she threatened a restraining order. he malded, kidnapped me to a sketch cabin in illinois woods. locked me in, key under his head. we fished, hunted, he’d trade catches for whiskey and trauma. widow sent a rescue himbo—pap pulled the "get off my lawn" glock move.  

lowkey, the cabin was vibes—no school, no rules, just vibes and rizz-free existence. but pap’s belt game was too OP. i was a walking bruise. when he’d dip for days, i’d plot escape. found a crusty saw, started carving a vent exit in the back wall. almost done when pap’s drunk footsteps sent me into clean-up mode.  

pap stormed in ranting about "mid govment" stealing his "investment" (me). went on a unhinged rant about a free black professor in ohio—"drip too clean, voting rights? sus. should be auctioned like fortnite skins." mid-rant, he yeeted over a pork barrel, screamed louder than a tiktok prank, cussed out "the system" between toe-holding agony.  

i mentally checked out, planning my forest arc—grab the glizzy, vanish into the map, outrun both pap and the widow’s civilize-me sims. tonight’s the night, if pap blacks out. i was locked in, but that saw was my golden ticket. pap kept yapping, i kept nodding, brain already in vanish mode.

after grubtime daddy-o grabbed the jug like "this juice could take down two frat boys and one tiktok e-girl" (his daily catchphrase). knew he'd be zooted within an hour - planned to either snatch the key or yeet myself saw-style. he kept slamming back that firewater till he faceplanted on his ratty blanket nest, but fate said 'lol nope.' dude wasn't fully out - kept twitching like a glitched NPC. moaning bout demons doing the macarena on his spine for hours. i finally crashed hardcore, candle still doing its lil lightshow.  

woke up to a scream that could crack concrete. pap doing the electric slide screaming SNAKES SNAKES SNAKES - claims they're crawling up his timbs. mans starts parkouring off the cabin walls yelling "get it off my neck!!" like bro you're fighting ghosts. he collapses wheezing, then starts breakdancing faster than a fidget spinner, swinging at imaginary haters. finally passes out silent. owls hooting outside like "this your king?"  

he sits up whispering paranoid: "footsteps... deadass coming for me... oh hell nah they're here! cold hands!! let go!!" then starts army-crawling under the table crying. absolute main character syndrome.  

suddenly he YEETS up, spots me, and pulls a knife screaming "ANGEL OF DEATH CATCH THESE HANDS!" i'm dodging like fortnite builds pleading "it's just huck!" but he's in final boss mode. he cornered me, grabbed my hoodie - i shucked it faster than a skinny filter and dipped. he crashed by the door wheezing "ima rest then clap you," knife under his cheek like a creepypasta.  

i big brain time: stole the shotgun, aimed it at his crusty self, and waited. clock moving slower than buffering porn.

"WAKE UP LOSER"  

sun blasting. pap looking like last night's taco bell regret. "why you cuddling a gun?"  

"someone tried to b&e - i was on guard duty."  

"why not wake me?"  

"tried! you were deadweight."  

"whatever. go check the fishing lines. i'll catch up."  

booked it outside. river rising - big driftwood Ws floating by. spotted a fresh canoe (straight flexing, 13ft drip). yeeted into the water clothes-on, claimed my loot. hid it in some sus willows thinking "this my escape pod to freedom - 50 miles downriver, new identity vibes."  

pap showed up later malding about my "slow ass." lied bout falling in. we scooped catfish and crashed hard.  

mid-nap glow up: realized i needed to full send this escape. when pap woke up slurping swamp water he growled "next prowler, wake me or catch these hands."  

eureka moment: time to method act my own murder.  

---  

noon. river on demon time. logged some driftwood wins. pap (being pap) bounced to sell it all, locking me in. i waited 5 mins then sawed freedom. grabbed every glizzy in the shack - cornmeal, bacon, coffee, ye olde whiskey, even the damn gourd. left the axe (too sus).  

covered my tracks better than a true crime podcast host. staged the cabin like a horror movie set: smashed door, pig blood axe prop, dragged a rocksack to the river (red herring level 100). wished tom sawyer was here - king of extra plot twists.  

planted a fake trail to a lake with cornmeal breadcrumbs. moon rose - i vibed in the canoe plotting. "they'll think i'm fish food while i'm posted on jackson's island like a minecraft streamer."  

drifted off. woke up to moonbathing - heard oars. pap (sober? plot twist!) rowed past. i ninja'd downstream, hid in driftwood, heard ferry peeps chatting nonsense. floated to the island like "new survival arc unlocked."  

---  

sun high. squirrels side-eyeing me. heard a BOOM - ferry cannonballing the river for my "corpse." remembered bread trick - scooped a floating loaf with mercury (OG lifehack). munched thinking "widow's prayers actually worked? sus."  

lit up, watched the ferry drift. hid behind a log - ready to peep who's hunting me.  

chapter 8:  

sun on demon time. forest vibe check: gloomy but chill. squirrels ranting. too lazy to cook - then BOOM. ferry smoking, yeeting cannons "for my remains." let them waste ammo - i'm snacking on stolen bread.  

widow's prayer bread found me? maybe god vibes with boomers but ghosts gen-z. smoked za, watched the ferry creep closer. hid ready to ID my hunters.  

(drip check: huck's island era = cottagecore meets wanted fugitive. river wide, moonlit, silent as a discord mod. canon fire = free entertainment. huck's living his best feral life.)

eventually the boat slid up lookin' mad sus, close enough for a tiktok transition to shore. whole roster was there: pap, judge thatcher, bessie (she bad lowkey), jo harper, tom sawyer's aunt polly (og helicopter parent), sid+mary duo, all the oomfs. everybody yappin' 'bout the "murder" but captain cut in like:

"ight squad fcs, river's doing its main character energy here—corpse prolly vibin' in the rizzless bushes. manifesting that tbh."

i was like nah fam we chillin. they all lean over rails doing the most, eyeballs peeled. i could see their lvl 10 clout chasing but they couldn't peep my stealth mode. captain yelled:

"yeet!" and the cannon went full send with a boom that left my ears on read and eyes watery from smoke. thought i was cancelled fr. if they'd packed heat, they'd have that "body found" tweet ready. but nah—still breathing, big W. boat dipped around the island's shoulder. heard occasional boom-boom sounds doing a distance speedrun until silence hit. island's three miles of main character energy—they probz hit the ick point and quit. except lol nope—sisyphean grind continued up missouri side, occasional cannon shots like bad tinder pings. i switched sides to watch. when they passed the island's forehead, they ghosted the hunt and bounced home.  

knew i was gucci. no more swat raids. pulled my drip from the canoe, built a glamping setup in the thicc woods. made a blanket fort to flex on rain. caught a catfish, did an unboxing vid with my saw. sunset? campfire mukbang time. set up fishing line for morning clout.  

dark mode activated—vibing by fire smoking that za, felt top tier till loneliness hit different. posted up by the river listening to water's asmr, counting stars and driftwood npcs. bedded down—no better way to clock out when the void whispers.  

three days of same-same. next day did an island tour—i was ceo of this dirt patch. found strawberries (s-tier), unripe grapes and razberries, baby blackberries doing their best. future snack prep.  

trekking deep woods near island's foot, gun in hand (for protection no cap). almost did a step-on-snek moment—nope rope darted into grass. chased it like a minecraft speedrunner till bam! stumbled on a still-smoking campfire.  

heart did the griddy in my chest. yeeted the gun's safety and backpedaled like a tiktok dance. paused in leaf bundles listening—breath louder than my airpods. every stick snap felt like death note jump scare. made it back to camp with negative rizz. packed my shit, scattered ashes like a decade-old airbnb, then tree-climbed for two hours of delulu watch—hearing phantom steps, seeing shadow people. finally said "this ain't it" and dipped back down, munching leftover berries and trauma.  

nightfall had me hangry. moonrise? paddled to illinois side quarter-mile. was finna post up there till heard clip-clop sounds and voice chat. yeeted everything into canoe faster than a dupe glitch, creeped through bushes for lore. heard a dude:  

"let's camp here if the vibes check out—horses are on their last hp."  

noped out silent mode. tied up canoe and tried to sleep—plot twist: couldn't. every micro-nap felt like a sleep paralysis demon hug. finally said "can't live like this—imma find my island twin or die cringe."  

grabbed paddle, edge of shore—canoe drifted shadow mode under moonlight (nearly daylight filter). scooted for an hour through quiet map. hit island foot area, felt crisp breeze—morning arc loading. beached canoe, gun in hand, logged into woods server. sat on a log doing peeping tom simulator. watched moon clock out and darkness buff the river. soon dawn's instagram filter lit treetops.  

gun up, creeped toward campfire coordinates—L after L till finally saw fire glitching through trees. approached like a valorant rat. spotted man-blanket burrito nearly kissing flames. almost shat my clout goggles—dude was miss watson's jim no cap. yelled:  

"yo jim!" and dabbed into view.  

he jumped like fnaf jumpscare, kneeled hands-up goin':  

"pls don't cancel me fam! deadass i stan spooky queens! go back to rivercore aesthetic—don't yeet old jim who's always ride or die!"  

took 0.2 seconds to explain i wasn't a ghost. vibe check passed—no more lonely. told him i'm not snitching. mans just stared silent rizz.  

"daylight bussin—let's brekky. stoke the fire jimmy."  

"why we microwaving mid berries? you got gun—let's secure the bag!"  

"you been eating nature's cringe buffet?"  

"had no other options bro."  

"how long you been stranded?"  

"since your 'unalive' era."  

"bruh—surviving on forage queen grindset?"  

"no cap. you?"  

"same timeline. let's pop off—you fire, i'll hunt."  

paddled to canoe spot. while jim lit fire, i pulled big meals—his jaw dropped like i did minecraft item duplication. caught another catfish—jim fileted it pro mode.  

brekky slapped. jim went gordon ramsay on it. post-meal we vibed till jim hit me with:  

"spill the tea huck—who died in the shack if not you?"  

explained my fake death arc—he called it "big brain, tom sawyer could never." then i asked:  

"why you here tho? spill."  

he side-eyed hard. "can't say."  

"why not?"  

"snitches get stitches. you ain't snitch right?"  

"on god jim."  

"aight. i...did a runner."  

"jim!"  

"you pinky promised no snitch!"  

"deadass i'm vaulted. normies would call me woke simp but idgaf—aint going back. spill."  

"miss watson was all up in my dms 24/7 but said she wouldn't sell me to orleans grindset. then i peeped a slave trader main hanging too much—got sus. one night heard her tell the widow she taking 800 bag for me. widow tried to ratio her but i dipped faster than a deleted tweet.  

hid in cooper-shop npc style—heard skiffs next morning yapping 'bout your 'death'. big sad at first but now we vibin. waited till dark, tried to nab boat but people were doing main quests—found a raft instead (no breadcrumbs). swam mid-river, glitched onto raft's edge. cloud cover clutch—hid on planks while npcs lantern-posted. river's speedrun current had me thinking i'd hit 25-mile mark by 4am.  

plot twist: lantern dude started patrolling. yeeted into water, swam to island but banks were tiktok cliff challenge. finally found entry point—said 'nah' to future raft ops. had pipe, matches, mid tobacco—survival mode engaged."  

"so you been on struggle meals? why no turtle mcnuggets?"  

"how? you can't sneak or rock-paper-scissors 'em! couldn't risk cringe daytime exposure."  

"fair. heard the cannon lore?"  

"oh bet—knew they simping for you. watched through bushcam."  

birds did short flights—jim called "rain omen." tried to catch some but he said "nope—my fams dead cuz granny cursed us over bird murder."  

jim dropped more superstitions: no counting dinner ingredients (cringe luck), no shaking tablecloth post-sunset (ghost dlc), bees need obituaries or they quit (literal hive mind). said bees don't sting npcs—i called cap.  

asked about good luck signs—he said "ratio's bad. only one: hairy arms/chest = future bag alert. might take years tho—don't unalive early."  

"you got the wookie vibe jim?"  

"open your eyes my guy."  

"you rich?"  

"not yet—had 14 once. did stonks: bought cow (died), sold hide for L. then one-legged homie started a crypto scam—put 5 in, promised 35 back. bought stolen boat but it got yoinked—rug pull moment. last 10 cents went to balum (dumb luck guy). he gave to church poor fund—preacher said 100x return. still waiting."  

"you'll reboot stonks someday."  

"already winning—i own me. 800 bag value. need liquidity tho."  

CHAPTER IX.  

wanted to check mid-island spot from earlier explore era. we moved out—island's 3x0.25 mile compact.  

spot was long steep hill—40ft grind. bushwhacked our way up, found cave flexing on illinois side. big as a twitch streamer suite—jim could t-pose inside. temp was ac vibes. jim wanted to move in but i said "nah—stairs bad."  

he argued "hide canoe, stash loot here—nobody finds us without furry hacks. plus birds said rain's coming—let our drip get wet?"

so we yeeted back to snag the canoe, paddled up to the cave’s main character energy, dragged all our loot inside. hid the canoe in some thicc rizzler willows, swiped fish off the lines & reset ‘em, then started prepping for a vibe meal.  
  
the cave entrance was tiktok famous levels of wide—like you could yeet a whole taco truck thru it. flat ledge on the side? perfect for a campfire collab. we built that bad boy up & grilled our fishies. threw the blankets down for a cozycore aesthetic & munched inside. stashed the rest of our haul deep in the cave’s dms. sky did a whole mood shift—thunder doing its dramatic monologue, birds absolutely called it. rain went full send, wind acting like it had a vendetta. one of those summer storms that’s all “i’m the main character.” turned the outside world into a blue-black filter, rain hitting the earth like it owed her money. trees looked sus thru the downpour, then a wind gust would hit & flip their leaves like they were showing off their reverse card. right when it got peak edgelord outside—ZAP! lightning said “surprise bish” & you’d catch trees doing the electric slide miles away. then *bam* darkness again, thunder rolling like someone dropped a whole travis scott concert down the stairs.  
  
“jim, this slaps,” i said. “wouldn’t main any other location. pass the fish glizzy & them cornbread croutons.”  
  
jim side-eyed me. “you’d be in the trenches rn without me, fam. drowning in the woods, no snacks. birds knew the forecast—stay mad.”  
  
the river kept flexing for days till it drowned the banks. illinois side looked like the pacific ocean, missouri side stayed a half-mile vibe check cause of them cliff hanger bluffs.  
  
daytime we’d paddle around the island—woods shady af even when the sun was on demon time. vines out here gatekeeping paths, had to nope out & reroute. every crusty tree had rabbits & snakes posted up like “free hugs.” when the flood hit, the critters got desperate—could literally pet ‘em (except sneks & turtles, they’d ghost you). our cave’s ridge was their meetup spot. could’ve started a petting zoo fr.  
  
one night we copped a chunk of lumber raft—pine planks vibing six inches above water. solid floof. saw logs floated by day but we stayed incognito. another night near the island’s apex, a whole tilted house floats by on the west side. two-story fixer-upper, leaning like it had one too many white claws. we paddled out, broke in thru an upstairs window (darkmode activated). tied the canoe & waited for daylight.exe to load.  
  
peeped the window at dawn: bed, table, chairs, floor confetti. clothes on the walls. something in the corner doing a mannequin challenge. jim goes “yo!” nothing. i yelled—nada. jim’s like “he’s giving corpse core. don’t look at the face, huck—uncanny valley vibes.”  
  
i stayed clear. jim tossed some drip over him. floor was littered with uno reverse cards (greasy), empty fireball bottles, edgelord charcoal graffiti. snatched calico dresses, undies, men’s fits—might resell on depop. found a skater boy hat, took it. baby bottle with a rag nipple—iconic but shattered. busted chest & trunk, nada inside. whole place screamed “we left in 2.5 seconds.”  
  
our haul: crusty lantern, handleless knife, fresh barlow blade, candles, tin cup, grandma’s quilt, sewing kit cringe, hatchet, nails, fishing line thicc as my pinky, monstera hooks, buckskin, dog collar, horseshoe, mystery meds. as we dipped, i found a horse brush & jim snagged a fiddle bow & a wooden leg (straps broke, but aesthetic).  
  
total glow-up. when we dipped, we were a quarter mile downstream. made jim lay under the quilt in the canoe—no one needs that “hey, i’m a runaway slave” energy. paddled to illinois side, drifted half a mile, crept under the bank incognego. made it home safu.  
  
---  
  
after brekkie i wanted to deep-dive the dead guy lore, but jim hit me with “that’s bad juju fr. unburied bodies be haunting tiktok lives.” sounded valid, so i zipped it—but lowkey wanted to know who clapped him.  
  
we searched the drip haul, found $8 sewn in a crusty coat. jim said “they def stole this, no cap.” i said “maybe they murked him too,” but jim wasn’t tryna manifest that energy. i dragged him: “you said snake skin was cursed, but look—we scored loot & cash. need this ‘bad luck’ every day, king.”  
  
jim shook his head. “don’t get cocky, my guy. the ick’s coming. tuesday talk? friday’s gonna dumpster us.”  
  
spoiler: it did. after lunch, we ran out of zyns. went to the cave, found a snek. clapped it, left it on jim’s blanket for a prank. forgot, then later—jim flopped down, snek’s bae bit his heel. chaos. jim chugged pap’s moonshine like it was prime. foot swole, leg phat. four days later, he was back. lesson learned: never touch snek merch. jim said “told you. bad juju’s still loading…”  
  
days passed, river chilled. we baited a hook with bunny bling, caught a catfish big as shaq. couldn’t lift it—yeeted itself to illinois. found a brass button & a ball in its guts. jim said “he’s been snackin’ that for clout.” biggest fish in mississippi history, periodt.  
  
next day i said “this is dry af. gonna sneak to town for lore.” jim said “disguise as an e-girl.” we tailored a calico dress, i practiced the girlboss walk. jim roasted my “npcing” & pocket checks. after dark, i paddled to illinois, drifted into town.  
  
peeped a light in a crusty shack. lady inside knitting—stranger danger. knocked, voice shaky: “i’m sarah williams from hookerville. mom’s sick, need uncle abner.” she fed me fake backstory, then spilled tea on pap & the “murder.” said pap framed jim for my death, $300 bounty on him. almost folded when she mentioned the island smoke—i fumbled threading a needle. she clocked me, smiled. “husband’s raiding the island tonight.” i panicked, asked why not day raid. she said “stealth mode, duh.” i dipped, heartrate on 100.

"fr tho, can't the homie see better too? after 12 he's gonna be in his zzz era, they can slide through the trees lowkey hunting his campfire vibe check – dark mode actually clutch if he's lit."  

"yo i didn't think of that drip."  

she kept side-eyeing me mad sus, had me tweakin. suddenly she's like:  

"what's your @ again bestie?"  

"m- mary williams."  

swear i didn't say mary before? felt like i'd said sarah. major oof, prob looking like 🚩. needed her to drop more lore – the silence was giving anxiety. then:  

"sweetie, thought u said sarah when u pulled up?"  

"oh yuh yuh! sarah mary williams. sarah's my deadname, some still call me mary for the glow-up."  

"oh word? that's the tea?"  

"fr fr."  

was less shook but still wanted to yeet outta there. couldn't make eye contact yet.  

she started yapping about struggle meals, rats doing free real estate tours, etc. the rat part was facts – little homies kept peeking from wall-holes. she said she yeets lead chunks at em when solo, flexed a twisted lead bar like "i usually clap em" but her arm was cracked from yeeting. told me to try – i wanted to dip before her hubby came back but played it cool. first rat that peeked got smacked. she's like "slay queen!" then brought yarn to wind, had me hold it while she talked marriage drama. suddenly:  

"eyelids on rats bestie, keep that lead in ur lap."  

*drops chunk* i thigh-locked it. she kept yapping but 60 seconds later snatched the yarn, stared into my soul kindly:  

"spill the boba tea. ur government name?"  

"wha- chu mean fam?"  

"ur irl name. is it b-rad? tommy? bobby? spill."  

i was vibrating like a ps5 controller. "pls dont roast me sis, if im cramping ur style ill–"  

"nah fam, park ur cheeks. im not snitching. trustfall? ill help. u a runaway zoomer right? valid. been there. spill the deets no cap."  

so i trauma dumped: dead parents, cringe foster farmer 30 miles back, stole his daughter's fit and ghosted. said my uncle abner in goshen would adopt me.  

"goshen? this st. pete's bestie. goshen's 10 upriver. who lied?"  

"some dude at dawn when i was gonna nap in woods. said fork right for 5 miles."  

"bro was zooted. gave u backwards coordinates."  

"yeah he was giving wobbly hulk but whatever. gotta bounce before sunrise."  

"hold up – snack pack incoming."  

as she wrapped it:  

"ok pop quiz no google: cow gets up – which end first?"  

"backshots."  

"horse?"  

"front end vibes."  

"moss side?"  

"north."  

"15 cows munching – same direction?"  

"all 15 no cap."  

"ok country kid, u pass. real name?"  

"george peters."  

"lock that in my dude. dont pull an 'oops its alexander' later. pro tip: ur girl cosplay needs work. threading needles? hold needle still, stab thread – girls do that. yeeting at rats? tippy-toe cringe, miss by 6 feet like a tiktok fail. caught the lead with knees together? sus. clocked u at the needle thread. now scram sarah mary george alexander peters – if u get canceled, dm mrs. judith loftus. stay on river road, wear shoes next time – them rocks gonna murder ur grippers."  

i fake-left then doubled back to my canoe, paddled upstream to island tip, tossed the bonnet. heard 11 dings from town. beelined to my old camp spot, lit fire, then zoomed 1.5 miles down to the cave.  

"jim! rise and grind! they on our tail!"  

no questions – king just started packing the raft like his life depended on it (it did). doused the fire, canoed out stealth mode. checked for boats – nada. raft moved slower than dial-up. agreed if boats came, we'd canoe to illinois.  

peeped the first campfire spot at dawn – prob had them simping over it all night. we tied up at a sandbar, camouflaged raft with branches. watched boats all day – told jim about the judith convo. he said "she a whole sleuth – bet she sent doggo search party." i said "why she no send hubby?" jim thinks they lost time getting dogs, why we safe 16 miles down.  

dusk: built a wigwam on raft, raised floor for dry vibes. made dirt fireplace, backup oar, lantern pole. nights were vibey – fish convos, skinny dips, stargaze rizz. passed sus shadow towns, then st. louis glow-up at 2am – quieter than a library.  

midnight storm fifth day: lightning showed a wrecked steamboat. "let's loot it!" jim said "nope, main character energy." i said "tom sawyer would yolo this – its free character development!" jim caved.  

sneak boarded wreck, heard voices:  

"pls bros i wont snitch!"  

"cap! u always want extra clout!"  

jim noped out. i stayed (tom sawyer would). saw tied-up dude, two guys arguing:  

"should clap him!"  

"nah i got reasons."  

tied dude cried "ily jake!"  

bill said "he killed old hatfield same way!"  

jake: "still wanna spare him."  

(cont.)

packard didn’t even clock it, just yeeted his lantern on a nail n’ started creeping towards my shadow realm, motioning bill to follow. i backpedaled like my life was a tiktok dance challenge, but the boat was leaning harder than a middle schooler’s flex—couldn’t speedrun. so i slid into some bougie upper deck closet. packard’s hands were all over the dark, and when he reached my spot, he’s like:  

“yo—get in here.”  

they both slide in, but i’m already in the top bunk, cornered like a minecraft noob. they lean on the ledge, whispering irl true crime podcast vibes. couldn’t see ‘em, but their breath smelled like regret n’ cheap vodka. glad i wasn’t on that vibe—wouldn’t matter tho, cuz i was holding my breath like the floor was lava. they were lowkey plotting to end turner:  

“he’s gonna snitch, fr. even if we cash app him our cut, he’ll still go full karen to the feds. let’s yeet him.”  

“bet,” packard says, chill as ice.  

“deadass thought you’d flake. let’s send it.”  

“hold up—gunshots? basic. if we gotta do this, let’s make it clean. boat’s gonna yeet itself in two hours anyway—let the river do the work. no fingerprints, no 5-star wanted level.”  

“bruh, what if it doesn’t sink?”  

“we’ll fkin’ see, won’t we?”  

they dipped. i’m sweating like a discord mod, scooting to find jim. dark as a void, but i whisper-yell “jim!” n’ he’s like “😩” right next to me. i’m like:  

“no time for main character trauma—murder squad’s here. we need their boat or it’s respawn screen for someone. find it n’ cut it loose so they can’t escape. i’ll check left, you right. start at the—”  

“BRUH THE RAFT’S GONE. WE’RE STUCK IN THIS FANFIC.”  

—  

i gasped like i’d been jumpscared. trapped on a cursed ship with these lvl 100 villains? nah. we had to yolo-find that boat. crept down the right side, slow as buffering—finally saw the skiff. i was ready to naruto-run in, but then packard’s head pops out. i froze—dude yeeted a bag in the boat n’ sat. bill follows.  

“toss that lantern, my guy.”  

they shoved off. my hands were noodle-weak, but then bill’s like “wait—did you loot him?” packard hadn’t. they went back inside. door slammed. i yeeted into the boat, jim tumbling after. sliced the rope n’ we vibed into the void.  

no oars, no chat—ghost mode activated. passed the wreck n’ booked it. later, saw their lil lantern glow like a discord notification—they’d missed the boat. karma’s wifi strong.  

—  

jim rowed while i doomscrolled my guilt. “should we…help them?” i said. “even villains need plot armor.” planned to land, spin a sob story, n’ call the cops. but storm said “lol no.” we vibed till the raft reappeared—big W.  

found their loot: drip, books, spyglasses, cigars. jim’s trauma still maxed: “if i get caught, miss watson sells me south. big L.”  

i read him king lore—dudes be flexing crowns, harem glitching. jim’s like:  

“solomon? overrated. splitting babies? that’s sus. man had a whole wife server n’ still messed up. shoulda built a factory instead.”  

“bro you’re missing the metaphor—”  

“nah. if you got 5 million kids, you won’t care. solomon’s just a rich kid with bad takes.”  

switched to louis xvi—lost his head. jim’s like:  

“kings in america? nah. mans would stream on twitch or something.”  

“french ppl talk weird—like ‘polly-voo’ nonsense.”  

“sounds cringe. i’d ratio anyone saying that.”  

we slept like we’d binge-watched the entire internet.  

—  

next day: flipped thru stolen books, jim side-eyeing my king simping. skies gray, vibes cozy. he stayed mad at solomon—king of bad decisions. i let it slide. sometimes, the smartest ppl miss the lore.

“bruh, that’s not your @. it’s just asking if u habla francais?”  

“den why he ain’t just say dat?”  

“he is, my guy! that’s their whole vibe. fr*nch ppl built different.”  

“sounds mad sus. i’m muting this convo, no cap. zero rizz in dat language.”  

“okay jimmy neutron—cats chat like us?”  

“nah.”  

“cows?”  

“nope.”  

“so why would cat-cow convo hit the same? fax?”  

“obvi not.”  

“different species, different dialects—vibe check passed?”  

“facts.”  

“so why mald when pierre got that baguette yapper? drop the logic.”  

“huck—is a cat on linkedin?”  

“no?”  

“den why it soundin’ like a ceo? can a cow even swipe up? is dis tinder?”  

“jim what’re u—”  

“frenchies human, right? den why they yappin’ like discord mods? drop the 4k ultra hd truth.”  

knew this man’s wifi was buffering. no use. yeeted the debate.  

✧CHAPTER 15✧  

we’re like 3 sleep cycles from cairo—ohio river collab, sell the raft, catch a steamboat to freedom. main character energy.  

night 2: fog rolls in thicker than stan twitter. we park at a tow-head, but when i paddle ahead to tie up? zooted saplings. wrap the line, raft goes full send downriver—yoinks the sapling like a bad wax. fog eats everything. i’m frozen cringe for 30secs. no raft. big L.  

jump in canoe, paddle reverse—forgot to untie. big panic hands.exe crashed.  

zoom after raft full doomguy mode. tow-head short king. pass it, fog swallows me. zero nav. 10/10 lost.  

think: paddling = instant yeet into bank. float. but hands feel tiktok fidgety. i scream. distant scream back. big W. chase, but my canoe’s drifting like a minecart glitch—screams keep shifting left/right.  

wish jim had tiktok airhorn. silent gaps = disaster.  

suddenly scream behind me. plot twist. toss paddle. scream moves like taylor swift eras tour—front, back, left. realize current spun me. pray it’s jim.  

slam into spooky tree island. current yeets me left through angry snags. white fog again. heart doing 180bpm.  

give up. jim’s on island’s other side. this ain’t no 10min island—full national park.  

float silent. ears on stalk. speed 5mph but feels like screensaver. snags zoom by like bullet trains.  

whoop every 5mins. reply miles away. chase, end up in tow-head maze. sounds dodge like pro league. islands try to kiss my canoe. raft speedrunning—i’m falling behind.  

finally, open river. no whoops. jim? snagged. ded? big sad. nap time.  

wake up—sky bussin, fog gone, spinning downstream. deja vu.  

river’s amazon prime. spot black speck—copium. first logs. second—raft!  

find jim head-down, arm over broken oar. raft looks like tiktok hack fail.  

i flop down, fake stretch: “yo jim, why u let me sleep?”  

“HUCK?! u alive?! main menu respawn?! let me dab u up—no cap u solid!”  

“u sippin’ henny?”  

“where’s the plug? huck ur tweakin’!”  

“why u talkin’ like i died?”  

“bro—look at me. u didn’t floor gang vanish? raft dipped in fog, we screamin’, got island-clapped, almost unalived!”  

“what fog? u dreamin’!”  

“dream?! how i speedrun trauma in 10mins??”  

“ur brain did a fanfic. it’s nada.”  

jim blue-screens. reboots: “must’ve been that za. strongest simulation i ever ran. felt like dark souls.”  

i gaslight: “dreams be draining. spill the lore.”  

jim serves fan theory: tow-heads = haters, whoops = red flags, current = main quest. survive = freedom.  

i point at raft trash: “what’s this lore then?”  

jim glitches. reboots: “u think i’m NPC? when u ghosted, i cried rizzler tears. u come back, troll me? trash move, huck. trash = u.”  

walks off. i feel like expired yogurt.  

wait 15mins. swallow pride. apologize. no more trolling.  

✧CHAPTER 16✧  

sleep grind. night: follow flexy raft—30 dudes, 5 tents, main character raft.  

river’s thicc with trees. cairo? probably whiff it. jim says look for river merge. i say “midwest mirage.”  

jim’s vibrating: “spot cairo = free tier unlocked.” every firefly = “dat it?!” nope.  

my anxiety 📈. jim’s freedom speech hits different: “gonna hustle, buy fam, abduct kids if needed.”  

i’m frostbitten. he’s wildin’ now that freedom’s a dm away. brain screams: “u helped this? SNITCH!”  

paddle to shore plan. jim hypes: “u da goat! my ride or die!”  

i’m sweaty. 50 yards out, skiff rolls up:  

“what’s that?”  

“raft.”  

“man on it?”  

“ye.”  

“white or black?”  

…  

“white.”  

“we’ll check.”  

(no cap i folded.)

"pls bro," i go, "cuz my dad's out here vibin' and lowkey sus. maybe y'all can help me drag this raft to shore? he's got that ick—same as mom and mary ann."  

"bruh, we on demon time rn," one goes, "but aight, let's send it. grip your paddle and let's bounce."  

i yeet into paddling. they start rowing. after like two strokes i add:  

"my dad'll stan y'all fr," i say. "everyone ghosts when i ask for help. can't carry this raft alone smh."  

"mad toxic," dude says. "sus. spill—what's your dad's deal?"  

they stop rowing. raft's right there. one squints:  

"cap," he snaps. "spill the tea. what's wrong with your dad? no cap or we dip."  

"on god," i sniffle, "just don't ghost. if y'all yeet forward, i'll toss the rope. no need to catch the ick."  

"reverse, reverse!" dude yells. "stay in your lane, my guy! smallpox? and you didn't lead with that? tryna start a pandemic arc?"  

"i tried," i sob. "they all peaced out. big L energy."  

"rough," he says. "here's the play: drift 20 miles, left side rizz. when sun's up, say your squad's got flu vibes. no more cringe moves."  

they yeet two twenties on a plank. "yeet these when we bounce. sry fam—can't risk the ickwave."  

"word," i say. "if i see any opps i'll snitch for clout."  

they dip. i board the raft feeling cringe. knew i fumbled—why try being wholesome when chaos pays the same? jim pops up from the river:  

"i heard everything," jim whispers. "was 'bout to ghost into the water if they boarded. you ate with that lie, huck! no cap, you saved my whole vibe. won't forget this slay."  

we vibe about the bag—40 whole doras! jim's like "steamboat deck passage letsgooo." but when dawn hits, we realize we zoinked past cairo in the fog. ohio river? missed. current dragged us back.  

"snake skin curse still on demon time," jim sighs. "we in the bad timeline now."  

paddling at night, steamboat comes vibin' like a glowing skibidi toilet. smashes our raft to bits—me and jim yeet opposite sides. i dive deep, snag a plank, and drift to shore.  

wander til dogs go apeshit at some bougie cabin. old dude interrogates me through the window:  

"name's george jackson," i lie. "fell off a boat. pls no cap."  

they let me in after patdown. whole fam bussin' with guns and sus energy:  

"shepherdsons here?" buck yawns. "lame. coulda clapped one easy."  

they feed me cold pizza-tier leftovers. spin a whole fanfic about my dead "family" in arkansas. when buck asks my name next morning:  

"bet you can't spell george jackson," i bait.  

he nails it. i pocket the spelling for future rizz.  

their house? aesthetic asf—brass knobs, dummy thicc fireplace, clock that dings 150 times like a tiktok trend. crockery pets that squeak but stay unbothered. wild turkey fans flexing like supreme merch.  

buck's all "wanna see my dog yeet sticks from the river? hate sunday best fits tho—cringe." we vibe til i pass out.  

wake up forgetting my own alias. buck spells it again—george jaxon. i note it down like cheat codes. whole fam's chill but lowkey waiting for shepherdsons to pull up.  

clock's pendulum swings. parrots stay silent. snake skin curse still buffering. we in the trenches fr.

the table was serving cunt with this oilcloth fit—red and blue eagle yassified, edges all artsy. straight outta philly fr. books stacked OCD-perfect on each corner: big bible flexing pic collabs, pilgrim’s glow-up (some guy dipped on his fam, no context), which i lowkey scrolled sometimes. facts were wild but dense. friendship’s offering had pretty words and sadboi poetry—skipped that. henry clay’s mixtape, dr. gunn’s webMD manual, hymnbook—all the vibes. chairs were unbothered queens, no saggy middle era.  

walls decked with Washingtons, Lafayettes, battle royales, some baddie named highland mary, and “signing the declaration.” dead daughter’s crayon art from her edgy teen phase—moody af, extra black. one pic: girlie in black corset fit, sleeves puffed like cabbages, goth shovel hat with veil, ankles wrapped in black rizz, tiny coffin shoes. she’s leaning on a grave under a weeping willow, clutching a hanky and purse. caption: “u ghosted me smh.” another: baddie with hair scooped into a chair-back bun, sobbing into a tissue, dead bird feet-up in hand. caption: “RIP tweet king.” third: girl at window staring at moon, tears on fleek, holding a breakup letter with black wax seal, smooshing a locket. caption: “u left me on read.” pics were aesthetic but gave me the ick when i was down bad. everyone malded she died mid-artsy era—she had more trauma-core visions queued. but tbh her main character energy probably vibed better haunting the cemetery. her last piece? girl in white gown on bridge edge, hair down, moonlit tears, six arms debating which pose slayed. she died before deciding—now it’s her shrine bed poster, flowers on her bday, otherwise shy with a curtain. lowkey pretty but arms too spider-verse.  

she had a death scrapbook—obits, accidents, suffering from presbyterian tea-spill mag. wrote original bangers like:  

**sadboi anthem for stephen dowling bots (yeeted down a well):**  

did stephen catch the ick? did he vibe check death?  
did the homies cry-scream? nah fam, rest in rizz.  
no flu, no rashes, no simping Ls, no stomach hell—  
bro’s soul just nyoomed to god tier via well.  
they drained him, but too late. mans was already in heaven’s DMs.  

if emmeline could barz like that at 14, she’d be billboard by 16. buck said she freestyled verses zero-effort—no cap, just slay. if rhyme failed, she’d yeet the line, drop a new one. any tragedy was her muse—funeral speedrun champ. neighbors said first the doc, then emmeline, then the undertaker. she only flubbed once (name: whistler, couldn’t find a rhyme) and slowly fizzled. RIP. sometimes i’d sneak into her room, read her cringe compilation when her art got too extra. i fw the grangerfords heavy—dead or alive. tried writing her a tribute but my pen game weak. her room stayed frozen in time—no sleepovers, ma dukes cleaned it herself, bible-study vibes.  

parlor had main character curtains—white with castle vines, cows hydrating. a piano with literal tin pan beats. girlies belted “last link is broken” and “prague battle” bops. walls plastered, carpets cozy, house glowed white outside.  

double house with a breezy courtyard vibe—lunch al fresco, meals slayed.  

**CHAPTER XVIII**  

col. grangerford was that dude—old money rizz, like a thoroughbred horse per widow douglas. bro was tall, slim, zero redness, clean-shaven villain face: thin lips, nostrils, high nose, brows on fleek, black eyes deep-fried into his skull. forehead fivehead, black curtain hair. long fingers, daily crisp white linen fit that screamed “dazzle cam.” sunday drip: blue coat with brass buttons, mahogany cane with silver head. no clowning, chill volume. kind but when he side-eyed you like a pissed bald eagle, you’d tree-up fast. his aura was sunlight or stormcloud—no in-between.  

morning ritual: fam stood till he sat. tom and bob mixed him a bitterz shot. cheers to the OGs.  

bob (oldest) and tom—tall zaddies, brown skin, black hair, white linen, panama hats.  

miss charlotte: 25, regal but chill until provoked—then death glare.exe.  

miss sophia: 20, soft girl vibes.  

each had their own NPC servant—mine was bored, buck’s overworked.  

fam downsized: three sons unalived + emmeline.  

colonel had farms, 100+ NPCs. parties with distant kin—guns, river raves, forest picnics, mansion EDM.  

shepherdson clan—same tax bracket, same boat dock. one day, buck and i hunting, heard horse—dove into bushes. young harney shepherdson rolled up, buck domed his hat. harney shot back, we booked it home. colonel lowkey proud but said “shooting from bushes? cringe.”  

buck later explained the family beef:  

“started 30yrs ago over some drama—lawsuit L, dude got shot. then tit-for-tat for decades. cousins, uncles, everyone gets yeeted. slow grind.”  

me: “why?”  

buck: “land? idk. OG’s dead. current gens just ride the wave.”  

last year: 1-1 KD. cousin bud (14, unarmed) got chased by old baldy shepherdson, outran him for 5 miles, took the L. baldy got clapped a week later.  

“sounds like baldy was a coward.”  

“nah—shepherdsons and grangerfords don’t do cowards. baldy 1v3’d on foot, still won.”  

church day: everyone strapped. preacher rambled about love—crowd debated theology like reddit threads.  

post-lunch snoozefest. found sophia shaking, asked me to sneak-fetch her testament from church. found a note: “half-past two.” she blushed, called me MVP, said it’s a bookmark. sus.

i dipped down to the riverfront lowkey overthinkin’ the whole situation, clocked my dude jack creepin’ behind me. once we cleared the crib’s sightline, he did a full 360 no-scope look around then sprinted at me like "bruh! slide into the swamp with me rn, imma show u a whole tiktok of danger noodles 💀"  

mind you—this man tried this same bit yesterday. sus behavior fr. who hyperfixates on serpent content? i hit him with the "bet. lead the way king."  

we yeeted through ankle-deep sludge for half a mile til we hit this overgrown patch. jack side-eyed me like "just vibe check those bushes my guy—snake central. seen it, done it, not my aesthetic anymore." then he ghosted into the trees.  

i pushed through the vines and—plot twist!—there’s jim snoozing like a disney prince. woke him up expecting main character reunion energy, but mans was all "no cap, i been stalking ur swim game since the boat dipped. heard u screeching but stayed on mute—didn’t wanna get clapped back into slavery arc."  

turns out he’d been lowkey building a glow-up raft 2.0 with stolen kitchenware while local NPCs kept him fed. i’m like "why didn’t u slide into my DMs sooner?" jim hit me with the "didn’t wanna stress u til our escape arc was queued up. but we bussin’ now fam."  

next morning, the whole compound was dead silent—major red flag. found jack by the woodpile spilling tea: "miss sophia ghosted her fam to elope with shepherdson bae. now the squad’s rolling deep with ARs and drama. buck’s out here on demon time swearing he’ll take a scalp."  

i bolted river-road speedrun style. heard gunshots, parkoured into a tree, and witnessed buck & his cousin joe serving cringe combat Ls to shepherdsons. whole scene was giving fortnite build battle but with casualties. then—jumpscare!—dudes flanked them through the woods, shots rang out, boys yeeted into the river while getting lit up.  

couldn’t unsee that trauma. dipped after dark, found buck & joe’s bodies—cried a lil while burying my homie. beelined to jim’s spot but raft was MIA. panic attack loading… until jim materialized like "king! thought u respawned in hell—was prepping a funeral float!"  

we launched that raft into the mississippi like it was gta getaway car. vibed under starlight debating astrology vs. chaos theory—jim swore the moon yeeted stars like frog eggs. passed steamboats doing midnight rave spark-shows. ate gas station sushi vibes (corn dodgers + swamp greens).  

days blurred into cottagecore serenity—misting rivers, frog ASMR, accidental rescue missions for randos fleeing cap. two dudes (bald king & his sus sidekick) hijacked our chill barge spouting "save us bro!" backstory? sketch. but that’s chapter 20’s problem.  

raft life = ultimate soft launch. no landlords, no drama, just existential star-chat and the occasional yeehaw massacre haunting my dreams. big yikes but we stay thriving ✌️

“yo i was flexin this toothpaste hustle – lowkey skrrted the enamel off too ngl – but i overstayed my welcome big time. was mid-sneaky-exit when u pulled up lookin shook af sayin the feds was comin. so i’m like bet lets bounce together. that’s my trauma dump – ur turn?”  

“bruh i was doin a whole sober king arc for the church moms – baggin $6 a night ez clap – til the streets said i was sippin secret juice. woke up to a homie sliding into my dms like ‘they comin with the DOGS fam – u got 30mins before they yeet u on a rail tar-and-feathercore’ – left without my avocado toast smh.”  

“old dude,” the zoomer vibed, “we could collab this grind – wydt?”  

“no cap. what’s your main grind?”  

“printerphobe by day, tiktok witchtok mystic by night – side hustle fentanyl jesus plays. u?”  

“i’m that girl – doin reiki for crypto bros’ chakras, preachin at burning man adjacent vibes. trauma reselling is my aesthetic.”  

silence hit like a roblox ban. then the youngin’ sigh-quirked:  

“cringe.”  

baldie side-eyed him: “why u main charactering rn?”  

“imagine peaking in high school only to end up NPCing with y’all.” *fake wipes tear with pizza crust*  

“bruh we ain’t the ones LARPing as disney villains – check your vibes.”  

“no no – i deserve this. let the algorithm cancel me. someday i’ll respawn in a better server where my tiktok ban gets lifted–” *more crust-dabbing*  

“yo what level you even falling FROM my guy?”  

“you wouldn’t get it – normies never do. but since u asked…*dramatic inhale*…i’m lowkey royalty. DUKE of bridgewater – straight up got gaslit outta my birthright by my toxic step-cousins.”  

jim’s eyes went 0_0. baldie choked: “sus.”  

“deadass! my ancestor yeeted from england for ‘freedom’ – which just meant getting clout-zoned by his own fam. i’m that missing heir tiktok conspiracy. and now?” *gestures at raft* “deinfluenced king living his cottagecore villain era.”  

jim and i did the *awkward supportive pats*. he demanded we NPC him properly – “call me your grace, serve my charcuterie first” – so we did. but baldie started malding HARD.  

“bilgewater,” baldie whispered hours later, “i too…am him.” *ugly cry activated*  

“spill.”  

“i’m – *sobs* – the LOST DAUPHIN OF FRANCE. louis xvii’s secret tiktok account. these wrinkles? trauma. this bald? stress. i’m literally napoleon’s unfinished fanfic.”  

jim and i swapped 🤨👀 but played along – now double-majestying these clowns. duke side-eyed everything but king was like “vibe check: let’s collab not combat. raft’s our shared hyperfixation pad.”  

*(huck’s internal monologue: these boomers ain’t shit but i’ll let them cosplay – cheaper than therapy.)*

“why y’all rafting incognito?” they pressed. “jim a runaway?”  

“as if!” i cackled. “who flees SOUTH? we Missouri orphans – fam ded, debtmaxxing. stole this raft to yeet to new orleans. pa got merked by a paddleboat skill issue. now Karens keep tryna cancel Jim – so we nightcrawlin’.”  

duke did the 🤓 emoji: “let me devious lick a daylight strat.”  

sky did the *sad react* emojis – thunder flexin like a tiktok filter. king tried claiming my bed: “corn-shuck mattress is straight cringe for my royal dumpy.” duke folded: “i’ll NPC – oppression is my brand.”  

post-midnight, storm went full diss track mode – waves doing tide pod challenges, lightning memeing the river. jim cackled when i got yeeted overboard.  

dawn hit. duke unboxed his trauma merch:  

“behold! i’m dr. phrenology bae (25¢ trauma charts), shakespeare’s cringe cousin, AND a witchtok influencer. king – u ever main character’d?”  

“nepo baby here. teach me.”  

“bet. you’ll be juliet – bald king in a nightgown? camp. these hicks’ll eat it up.”  

later in town – streets emptier than a metaverse concert. some zooted dude said everyone was at a camp revival. king’s eyes went 🤑: “time to grift some holy rollers.”  

the meeting was lit – pickups everywhere, lemonade stands, thirst traps in calico. preachers yellin’ bout hellfire while teens slid into DMs. king whispered: “watch me go viral.”  

duke meanwhile found a printer spot – walls plastered with “MISSING” memes. “perf,” he grinned, “time to mint some NFT vibes.”  

——  

*(huck’s final thought process: these boomers’ delulu is their solulu. let them king/duke LARP – cheaper than discord nitro.)*

the first shack we rolled up on, the preacher was serving hymn lyrics like a spotify playlist. he'd drop two bars, crowd would sing it back full send—straight chills, ngl, 'cause there were so many voices going ham. then he'd yeet out two more lines, rinse and repeat. the vibe kept escalating—soon folks were full on sobbing, others screaming their souls out. then preacherman switched to his main gig, preaching his whole chest, pacing the stage like a tik tok dancer, arms flailing, bible in hand yelling "this the holy glizzy in the thirstlands! stare at it and level up!" crowd screaming "slay!—a-freaking-men!" and he's just going:

"yo, all my sinners—pull up to the trauma bench! (amen!) come thru with your Ls and bad takes! (amen!) come limping, come blindswiped by life! (amen!) come broke and cringe, drowning in shame! (a-men!) come crusty, come problematic—serve those broken vibes! arrive in your filthiest fit! salvation's free, heaven's dms are open—slide in and vibe eternal!" (a-MEN! clout to the sky, hallelujah!)

chaos mode engaged—couldn't even hear the preacher over the sobs. people elbowing through the crowd, ugly-crying their way to the front benches, then collapsing on the floor like it's a tiktok challenge gone wrong.

outta nowhere, king starts yapping louder than the whole crowd, then charges the stage. preacher's like "spit your truth, king!" and he delivers: "yo, i was a whole pirate boss in the indian ocean—30 years deep. my crew got yeeted last spring in some mid battle, so i'm recruiting new ones. but shoutout to the og's who robbed me last night—left me stranded with zero bread. biggest W of my life 'cause now i'm reformed! gonna grind my way back, no cap, and convert all pirates to simps for jesus. and every time i flip a pirate, imma say 'don't thank me—big ups to the pokeville holy fam and this preacher dude, the real mvps!'"

waterworks activated—everyone crying. someone yells "cash app this legend!" king starts passing the hat, sniffling about "bless these kind souls helping pirates abroad." girls asking for cheek kisses—king's collecting smooches like pokémon. they beg him to stay, but he's like "can't, my dudes—gotta catch a flight to the ocean, redemption arc waiting."

back on the raft, he counts the bag—87.75 and a stolen jug of firewater. king's like "best grift ever, pirates > missionaries any day."

duke's salty his scams are mid compared: printed some fake horse flyers for $4, ran a "50% off ads" scam for the local paper. even wrote cringe poetry "yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart"—left it in the press for free. total earnings: $9.50. then he shows us a "missing" poster for jim—200 bounty, exact description. duke's plan: "tonight we cuff jim with ropes (chains too bougie), say we caught him upstream. keep it poverty-core for the aesthetic."

we agreed to dip after dark, avoid the town drama. jim later asks if we'll meet more kings. i said nah. he's like "good—this one's always zooted, duke's barely better."

next morning, king and duke look crusty but freshen up with a river dunk. king practices romeo barefoot, legs dangling. duke coaches him: "don't yell 'romeo!' like a fortnite kid—say it soft, like you're simping on main." they sword fight with lath sticks until king yeets himself overboard. 

duke decides to add an encore—teaches king hamlet's soliloquy but it's all mixed up: "to yeet or not to yeet—that's the glizzy. who'd carry trauma packs till the forest walks? but fear of ghost mode post-death murders sleep-potion, makes us yeet into 404 errors. ophelia—go touch grass, babe!" king nails the drama, crying on cue.

we floated to a janky arkansas town, posted cringe play bills: "shakespeare revival!!! romeo vs julius slay edition. richard iii sword clout. hamlet's trauma dump. tickets: $0.25, no cap." the town's all mud, pig chaos, and loafers chewing borrowed tobacco. hogs nap in streets; dogs chase turpentine-lit strays. houses half-submerged in river mud, crumbling like my will to live.

by noon, circus wagons roll in. locals hype for "old boggs"—dude on his monthly bender. loafers joke: "if boggs fought everyone he threatened, he'd be a tiktok legend." one's like "i wish he'd come for me—immortality unlocked."

we dipped before sunset, canoed past the town, waited til dark to raft on. jim took night watch, asked about more kings. i said we're good. he sighed: "dis one's a walking red flag, duke's just extra." 

kept floating, the cons cooking, river dragging that janky town deeper into the mud.

boggs comes zoomin' on his horse hollerin' like a tiktok hypebeast main character energy: "move besties, main character incoming, coffin sales gonna skyrocket frfr." 

bro was wasted, swervin' like a minecart on ice—dude's 50 going on 15 with that redbull face. crowd's all "LOL grandpa's lit again," clout-chasing him hard. he claps back like "i'll ratio y'all later" but says he's gotta yeet colonel sherburn first cuz "grindset before sidequests."

spots me n' goes "yo where you even from kid? u got your affairs in order?" then dips. i'm shook but some dude's like "he's just vibing, always does this when he's turnt—total sweetheart, never hurt a fly, sober or lit."

boggs pulls up to the town's main flex zone (that bougie general store) screaming "SHERBURN! COME OUT YOU SKETCHY NFT BRO! YOU'RE THE LOOT I'M HERE TO CLAIM!" 

whole crowd's screen-recording this drama. then sherburn steps out fresh as a tiktok thirst trap—crisp fit, icy glare. drops the coldest "i'm over this but imma let you cook till 1pm. after that? catch these hands anywhere." 

suddenly the vibe shifts like someone canceled wifi. boggs keeps cappin' down the block but the NPCs try to nerf him. dudes be like "it's 12:45 bro chill" but he's spittin' bars, yeetin' his hat under horse hooves. 

someone's like "GET HIS DAUGHTER—SHE'S HIS ONLY WEAKNESS!" zoomers sprint for her. next thing i see boggs getting escorted like a noob in among us—two dudes gripping him while he's walking sus. 

sherburn hits the dougie in the street, glock pointed skyward like "ayo boggs—" *click*. crowd peels back like sticky phone screen protectors. BANG! boggs does the tiktok death drop. his daughter screeches like a fangirl at a bts concert. 

they drag him to the cvs clinic. me? i'm front row view-hacking the window. bible on his chest doing the chestbump challenge with his last breaths. daughter's crying like she lost her stan account. 

whole town becomes a clout-chasing mess. some eboy reenacts the shooting with a selfie stick cane—crowd's dming him shots (liquor, not pics). then somebody's like "let's cancel sherburn irl" and suddenly it's jan6th at the capitol but make it wild west. 

mob rolls up to sherburn's crib like "WE DEMAND BLOODTUBE CONTENT!" sherburn ascends his porch like a discord mod with double-barrel drip. crowd freezes—silence louder than airpods on max volume. 

mans scans the crowd like "y'all really think you're mob bosses? cringe. you're all bark no bite. average southern 'sigma' grindset is cap—y'all wouldn't press charges if someone yeeted your vbucks. why you think lynch mobs wear ski masks? cuz y'all got NPC energy. take buck harkness (mid af) and scurry back to your mom's basements." 

crowd disbands faster than a twitter space after elon joins. i bounce to the circus—clowns doing backflips, horses dripped out in fit checks worth milli, some drunk dude becomes the main attraction by cosplaying as a rodeo glizzy. 

ringmaster gets bamboozled when the "drunk" reveals he's circus mcyt all along. crowd loses it—dude strips 17 fits like a tiktok transition. i'm like "this is cinema." 

later the duke n' king try to scam locals with a "no cap, no kids, no femmes" shakespeare parody. king crawls out naked like a minecraft strider on bath salts—crowd howling. duke's like "three shows only!" but the villagers scream "ratioed!" next day? whole town's a meme page dragging them.

"yo wait up! just one sec, my guys." they paused. "we got absolutely finessed—like mega cringe. but we can't let the whole chat roast us 24/7, right? vibe check: we dip quiet, gas this play up on main, let the rest of the town fomo in. then we all take the L together. big brain?" ("facts! king spittin'!" everyone clout chimes.) "bet—no snitching. ghost out, tell the gc to come vibe at the tragedeigh."  

next day the whole town's algorithm was "slayfest 10/10 no notes." sold out again that night—same scam, same bag. when me, the "king," and "duke" bounced back to the raft, we crushed midnite munchies. then they made me & jim yeet the raft downstream lowkey, hide it two miles past vibeville.  

night three? packed again—same crowd, no new meat. i stood by duke at the door clocking every dude with lumpy pockets or sus coat lumps. def not drip—smelled like expired deviled eggs & moldy flex. if dead cat vibes got a scent, 64 walked in. i dipped after 0.2 secs—sensory overload, no cap. when the venue hit max capacity, duke palms a npc a quarter to guard the door & we bolt around back. he hisses:  

"zoom tf outta here til you clear the cribs, then naruto-run to the raft like you speedrunning!"  

we yeeted—double tapped the raft, gliding downstream incognito mode. thought the king was gettin' ratioed by the crowd, but nah—he crawls out the wigwam like "how'd the skit clout hit, duke?" bro hadn't even logged into town.  

no lights til we were 10 miles downstream. lit a campfire, king & duke cackling like tiktok trolls. "absolute noobs! knew night one would gatekeep the scam. night three? they thought it was their main character moment! bet they made it a whole collab w/ potluck cringe."  

bagged $465 in three nights—money printer glitch. later, when they snored, jim whispers:  

"huck, these 'kings' be wildin—why you not shook?"  

"cause it's canon. all kings built like that."  

"but huck, ours zesty as hell!"  

"word. historical kings? henry viii made ours look like disney princes. dude wife-hopped & yeeted heads daily. ordered executions like doordash. charles ii? louis xiv? whole lotta ick. our kings mid, but still lvl 99 grifters."  

"but dis one smell like hot garbage, no cap."  

"all kings stank, jim. biohazard perk."  

"duke kinda chill tho?"  

"nah—dukes just kings w/ better pr. drunk? same vibes."  

"no more, huck. i maxed out on ick."  

"same. but algorithm says we stuck. pray for a no-monarchy server someday."  

why tell jim they fake? copium. couldn't tell diff anyway.  

i crashed. jim didn't wake me—sometimes he let me sleep. dawn cracked, him slumped over, quiet sobbing. knew why: missin his fam. wild how he loved 'em like white folks do—kinda glitchy, but facts. usually he whispered "lil ’lizabeth… johnny…" at night. jim real ones.  

this time i slid into his dms bout his kids. he sighed:  

"heard a slam onshore earlier—triggered my lizabeth trauma. she was 4, caught scarlet fever. survived, then one day i told her 'close the door.' she just stood there gigachad smiling. i yelled. she stayed. i malded—thwacked her head. left for 10 mins… came back, door open, her crying in the doorway. wind yeeted it shut—BAM—she didn't flinch. realized… she was deaf, huck. i broke down—never forgive myself."  

---  

next dusk, we posted up near two towns. duke & king plotting new grift. jim complained bout being tied in the wigwam 24/7—suspicious if loose. duke 200iq: dressed jim in king lear cosplay (curtain robe, wig), slathered him in drowned-corpse blue makeup. absolute jumpscare cryptid. sign said:  

*sick arab—no beef if medicated*  

jim vibed—better than rope life. duke said "howl like a demon if anyone snoops." solid plan, but jim looked more dead than amongus.  

scammers wanted to rerun the play, but feared cancellation. duke schemed arkansas village plot; king rawdogged the other town "trusting the universe" (satan, prob). we copped new fits—king in all black, lookin like a megachad pastor. glowed up from sewer rat to holy rizz.  

king: "paddle to the steamboat—say we from st louis drip."  

i zoomed. found a country kid sweating with luggage. king (fake brit accent): "destination?"  

"steamboat—nola then rio."  

"board up! adolphus (me) grab his bags."  

kid grateful, said traveling sucked. asked if king was "mr wilks"—some dead guy's bro. king lied: "rev blodgett. rip peter wilks tho."  

kid info-dumped: peter died, left loot, bros harvey (uk preacher) & william (deaf) mia. funeral noon tomorrow. king grilling him like a fbi agent—town lore, peter's tannery, hidden cash.  

"why walk to boat?"  

"st louis boats ignore hails—deep draft."  

king: "we all gonna die someday—stay prepped."  

steamboat left—king made me paddle upstream. "fetch duke & bags. tell him main character time."  

duke arrived. king explained the wilks lore in tiktok british. duke: "i can fake deaf king shakespeare."  

hitched a cincinnati boat—crew malded over short trip. king zen.  

(btw this whole scam arc? prime content farm material. huck's internal "yikes" radiating thru the cringe.)

“if these flexers can drop a bag per mile for yachting privileges, the boat’s gotta comp them right?”  

so they chilled and said bet, and when we docked they yeeted us ashore. mad locals swarmed when they clocked the yacht, and when the king’s like:  

“anyone got the deets on mr. peter wilks’ crib?” they side-eyed each other doing the whole ‘i told you’ nod. one soft-launched:  

“no cap, he’s ghosted. best we can do is his last known addy from yesterday.”  

king.exe immediately crashed—full meltdown mode, faceplanting into some dude’s shoulder, sobbing into his back like:  

“our kingpin brother unalived? we never even linked 😭 this ain’t vibes!”  

then he yeets sign language at the duke, who drops his gucci duffle and starts bawling. these two scammers were cringe-maxxing fr.  

the crowd ate it up, carrying their bags uphill, letting them sob on their shoulders, spilling tea about peter’s last breath. king re-enacted it in emoji hands for the duke, both crying harder than swifties at eras tour. i’ve never seen such oscar bait—made me secondhand embarrass for humanity.  

**chapter xxv (viral era)**  

the tea spread faster than a tiktok trend. locals sprinted in, half-dressed, forming a moshpit outside. windows packed; randos yelled over fences:  

“they here?”  

someone in the mob clapped back: “ong yes.”  

at the house, the street was lit. three girls at the door—mary jane (ginger but slaying), face glowing like she won stan twitter. king spread arms, mary jane yeeted into them, hare-lip girl glomped the duke. crowd cried like it’s a k-drama finale.  

king peeped the coffin in the corner, did the slow-mo walk of shame with the duke, everyone silent as a library. they peeked inside and wailed like banshees, hugging like they’d never let go. whole room turned into a waterpark. then they kneeled, “praying” (aka farming clout), making the crowd sob harder.  

king steps up, serving a speech drenched in performative tears: “our kingpin bro’s rizz lives on through y’all’s vibes 😔✊” capped it with a cringe amen, crying like he lost his fortnite save.  

someone in the crowd drops a hymn remix, everyone joins—suddenly it’s a gospel concert. music cleansed the cringe, ngl.  

king then invites the main clique to a “grief munch” to flex with the ashes. name-drops local celebs, but some are mia (doc robinson out here doing villain arc). lawyer bell’s on a sidequest.  

king starts fanficcing peter’s dms, name-dropping every npc in town—lowkey info he scammed from our boat guy earlier. mary jane hands over peter’s will: house + 3k gold to the girls, tanneries + 7k drip to the “brothers.”  

scammers volunteer to “secure the bag” in the cellar. when they spot the gold, king’s eyes glowed like he won the lottery: “bilji this is main character energy!”  

they count it—comes up 415 short. king’s like “where’s the rest? sus.” duke shrugs: “he was glitching, let it slide.” but king insists on being “transparent” (💀). duke whips out his own stack to cover it—king calls it “big brain.” they restack clean 6k.  

duke whispers: “let’s flex the cash in front of the girlies.” king’s mind blown: “you’re the ceo of rizz!”  

upstairs, they pile the cash into aesthetic stacks. crowd hungrier than a mukbang comment section. king serves another monologue: “our bro’s legacy is y’all’s inheritance 💅” cues duke to hug him like a telenovela. girls grab the bag, crowd cheers like they won squid game.  

iron-jawed doc robinson crashes, calls cap: “you’re giving british cosplay 💀 peter’s bro? nah, you’re z-list.” crowd tries to cancel him, but he drags the girls: “wake up, he’s a walking red flag!”  

mary jane claps back, handing the bag to king: “invest it, no receipt needed.” crowd stanning, doc dips: “y’all gonna regret this cringe.” king trolls: “we’ll lyk if we need trauma bonding 😌”  

**chapter xxvi (sleepover shenanigans)**  

after the clout chase, king asks mary jane about rooms. she offers hers to “uncle harvey,” sleeps with sis on a cot. my spot’s a closet-sized attic.  

supper’s served—i’m on plate duty. hare-lip girl quizzes me on england:  

“you ever seen the king?”  

“william iv? duh, he’s at my church.” (he’s dead but 🚫🧢)  

“he lives in london tho?”  

“summer home in sheffield 💅”  

“sheffield’s not coastal?”  

“you think congress-water needs congress? stay in school.”  

she’s flabbergasted. i yeet a chicken bone choke excuse. crisis averted.

“they cop that shit in bulk like we do with that basic ahh mineral water. over there in sheffield’s main flex zone they got industrial heaters n’ shi—bro wants his hydro scalding. no way they’re boiling ocean juice on-site, zero rizz for that infrastructure.”  

“oh bet, shoulda led with that instead of yappin’.”  

clutched that W—she believed me again, no cap. then she hits me with:  

“you do the church grind?”  

“fr, every sunday slay.”  

“where you post up?”  

“our fam’s vibechair.”  

“whose?”  

“my uncle harvey’s, duh.”  

“his? mans needs a whole throne?”  

“to sit?? whatchu think he doin’—practicing tiktok dances?”  

“deadass thought he’d be up there preaching.”  

f*ck. forgot he’s a preach king. scrambled for a save: “bruh you think churches only got one main character? lmao girl you’re delulu.”  

“why they need extras?”  

“to flex on royalty? they got like seventeen, no 🧢.”  

“SEVENTEEN? i’d rather delete my existence. takes a whole week to cycle thru!”  

“nah they rotate—one rizzler per service. others just chill, pass the collection plate, be decorative. aesthetic vibes.”  

“that’s dumb as hell. how’s england treat their servants? better than our… y’know?”  

“servants be NPCs there. treated worse than minecraft mobs.”  

“they get holiday drops? like christmas, july 4th?”  

“💀💀💀 found the noob. joanna—zero PTO. no capes, no theaters, no lit events. nothing.”  

“church?”  

“nope.”  

“but you said—”  

sh*t. forgot i’m supposed to be harvey’s sidekick. word-vomited some bs about “valet privilege” and legal church requirements. she wasn’t buying it:  

“spill the tea—you cappin’ rn?”  

“on god.”  

“zero fax?”  

“pure unedited content.”  

“swear on this book.”  

it was a dictionary. i palmed it like a bible. she half-believed me: “aight i’ll stan 50% of this fanfic.”  

mary jane stormed in with susan: “joe, why you bullying our guest? imagine if you were him—embarrassed af!”  

“he’s spitting fanfiction!”  

“idc. be kind or catch these hands.”  

my conscience did a backflip. these girls deserve better than getting scammed by crusty larpers.  

later, brain buzzing: *how do i snatch their bread back?* can’t snitch to the doctor—king n’ duke would end me. can’t tell mary jane—she’d panic n’ botch it. gotta steal it stealth mode, then dm her coordinates later.  

crept to their rooms. duke’s spot was dry. king’s stash? needed light—too risky. decided to eavesdrop. hid in mary jane’s closet when footsteps came.  

king n’ duke whispered:  

“we should dip before 3am. doctor’s sus. take the bag n’ bounce.”  

my soul crumpled. king objected: “abandon 8k in assets? we’re selling their whole inventory—buyers’ problem when it’s repo’d. orphans’ll survive, they young n’ can hustle.”  

duke caved. then panic: “the money’s not safe—maids might yeet the stash during mourning cleanup.”  

king: “facts. hide it better.”  

they stuffed the bag under the mattress straw. i yoinked it once they dipped, hid it in my cringe closet.  

later, funeral time. coffin open. yeeted the bag under peter’s icy hands. mary jane came crying—i ghosted.  

next day, coffin sealed. biggest L of my life—if they find it during burial, king wins. wanted to unalive myself.  

funeral vibes were hella solemn. undertaker moved like a tiktok transition. preacher got interrupted by a barking glizzy in the basement. undertaker handled it, whispered “he slayed a rat” for clout.  

king auctioned everything next day—girls oblivious, thinking they’ll move to england. i’m screaming internally. this whole situation is sus af.

so next day post-funeral vibes got wrecked big time around noon. these sketchy dms slid thru & king yeeted the homies for some sus "3-day crypto" scam - boys shipped upstate, momma down south. girls & fam were absolutely *not* vibing, crying their eyes out like it's the last season of their fave show. lowkey had me in my feels ngl. girls kept saying they never saw that plot twist coming - fam getting CTRL+ALT+DELETED from the server. can't unsee them group-hugging & sobbing fr, would've snitched on our clown duo if i didn't know it was cap & they'd respawn in a week.  

town was tweeting mad threads too - locals called it "toxic af" to split the fam. king kept doubling down like a tiktok comment warrior while duke side-eyed hard.  

fast forward to auction day o’clock: king & duke bust into my crib looking like they got ratioed. king hits me with:  

"you in my DMs night before last?"  

"nope your cringe-lord" - my go-to when we’re gatekeeping.  

"yesterday? last night?"  

"negative rizz."  

"on god?"  

"on god no cap - haven’t glitched near your lair since mary jane gave y’all the cringe tour."  

duke leans in:  

"seen anyone else sus there?"  

brain buffering…then:  

"yo the homies kept sliding in & out."  

they did the surprised pikachu face but lowkey expected it. duke:  

"all at once?"  

"nah - except that one time post-funeral. i was late-king it, saw them ghosting out."  

king clutches his nonexistent pearls: "bruh." duke does that fake laugh tiktokers do & goes:  

"absolute cinema! we thought they were main character-ing with the sadboi act. oscar bait fr! could’ve viraled them on tour but we NFT’d them for pennies smh."  

i peeped:  

"y’all good?"  

king spazzed: "mind yo business NPC!" then whisper-argued with duke: "we gotta take the L quietly."  

as they dipped duke muttered:  

"fumble era! entrepreneurship is a vibe ig."  

king snapped back: "my play was valid! no profit? skill issue - not my fault!" they dragged me again for not snitching sooner. i let them mald while i big brained saving jim later.  

---  

chapter 28: plot armor engaged  

later when i rolled to breakfast, saw mary jane crying over her suitcase - england arc ruined ‘cause fam separation. i hit her with:  

"spill the trauma dump sis."  

she said the homies thing (called it). i accidentally rizzed: "they’ll reunite in 2 weeks fr!"  

she full on glomped me demanding receipts. panik. said she’d dip to mr. lothrop’s spot if i explained. she agreed faster than a stan buying concert tix.  

locked the door & said:  

"brace for cringe: your ‘uncles’ are lolcows. whole thing’s fanfic."  

she went full karen mode: "let’s cancel them to the sun!"  

i said: "chillax - gotta stay undercover to save my day1 jim. auction’s fake anyway - funds are sussy. homies boomerang back, money’s MIA."  

made her pinky-promise to bounce pre-breakfast so her face wouldn’t snitch. she asked about the cash:  

"king yoinked it but i swiped it for u. hid it in…" *flashbacks to corpse cringe* "...check this note later."  

wrote: *"bag’s in coffin. saw u crying at 3am - u valid queen."* she cried, shook my hand like we won squid game, & ghosted.  

absolute legend - would’ve prayed for me? she’d main character pray for thanos tbh.  

told her sisters she’s at "proctors’" due to "new mumps++" (brainrot edition). hare-lip said:  

"that’s not how mumps work?"  

i said: "it’s lore accurate - mixes covid, ligma, & astral projection. total ick."  

she ran to snitch while i prepped the biggest uno reverse card of 1843.

"fr look at it for a sec and maybe you'll get it. your uncles gotta buss it back to england asap right? you think they'd be that toxic to leave you on read for the whole trip? they'll def hold the lobby. W so far. your uncle harvey's like a pastor vibe yeah? so would a holy skrrt lie to some zesty boat ticket dude? cap. what's his play then? he'd be like 'sadge but my church grind can't stop slaying - my niece got that sus unalive juice (mumps? idk) so i gotta camp here for 3 months to see if she glows up wrong.' but lowkey if you wanna snitch on uncle harvey—"  

"bruh why we stayin' cringe here when we could be flexin' in england waiting to see if mary jane's got the ick? you soundin' like a whole clown rn."  

"anyway maybe tell the neighbors?"  

"ayo listen to this bozo. they'd snitch immediately. no cap the only play is radio silence."  

"facts you right."  

"but should we tell uncle harvey she stepped out so he don't get main character syndrome?"  

"slay mary jane said exactly that. 'send hugs n kisses to uncles harv n william, say i yeeted across river to vibe with mr...' wait what's that bougie family your uncle pete simped for—"  

"apthorps?"  

"YES slay those names always give me the ick. anyway she said 'tell them to secure the bag at the auction cuz uncle peter would want them to cop the house. imma rizz them up till they commit. might crash there if i get too lit.' oh and DONT mention the proctors just apthorps - which is facts cuz she's there about the house. she told me irl."  

"bet" they said, ghosting to find their uncles and spill the tea.  

everything was vibing. girls kept quiet cuz england arc, while the king & duke wanted mary jane away from dr robinson. i felt big brain - like tom sawyer couldn't even. he'd add more rizz but i'm not him ykno?  

the auction dragged like a tiktok live. king was fronting hard next to the auctioneer, dropping bible bars and uwu energy. duke was doing sob story asmr. finally sold everything except some mid plot in the cemetery. king wanted to finesse it too but then a boat pulled up and chaos erupted:  

"NEWSFLASH! two sets of heirs for the peter wilks legacy! pick your side nerds!"  

chapter 29:  

they brought in a dilf and a zaddy with his arm in a sling. crowd went wild but i saw zero meme potential. thought the duke & king would panic but nah. duke kept his rizz face, king did sadboi eyes at the new guys like "how dare these scammers exist?" main character energy. locals flocked to king to stan. new dilf looked confused af then started talking proper bri'ish (not king's tiktok british). he said:  

"this is unhinged. me n my brother (william, he's mute btw) are the real harvey n william wilks. our luggage got yeeted upstream last night. check our drip when it arrives. til then we'll be at the motel."  

they dipped. king laughed: "broken arm? sus. lost luggage? creative writing 101!" crowd lol'd except some NPCs including dr robinson and levi bell (lawyer from louisville). a buff dude pressed the king:  

"yo if you're harvey when you pull up here?"  

"day before the funeral around sunset."  

"how?"  

"susan powell boat from cinci."  

"then why you clout chasing at the pint next morning in a canoe?"  

"i wasn't."  

"🧢"  

crowd gasped. dr robinson said "anyone ID the kid with him?" buff dude pointed at me. dr gripped my hand like a parent at disney:  

"let's ratio these frauds at the motel. collab with the new duo."  

vibes were immaculate for the crowd (L for king's squad). we mobbed to the motel. dr kept death-gripping me.  

in the lit room, dr said:  

"no cap these sus men might have cronies snatching peter's bread. let's secure the bag til they verify."  

crowd agreed. but king did 😔 emoji:  

"i wish the bread was here but my niece hid it in my mattress. the help stole it next morning - ask my servant."  

dr side-eyed: "you bri'ish?"  

i said "yas" and they laughed "LARP!"  

they grilled everyone for hours. king side-eyed me so i spun a sheffield fanfic. lawyer levi bell cut me off:  

"sit down lil bro you're giving secondhand embarrassment. not ypur fault - you need practice."  

dr tried speaking but king interrupted:  

"wait you're my dead bro's day one?"  

king n lawyer did secret convo. lawyer said "we'll mail for verification." king n duke wrote some cringe. lawyer compared handwriting:  

"these ain't match. new dilf's scribbles are unreadable."  

new dilf: "my brother transcribes for me."  

lawyer: "bruh. one's mute can't write. this whole thing's sus. neither of these clowns are wilkses."  

king doubled down: "william's a troll! he trolled the handwriting check!"  

new dilf had an idea: "who prepped peter's body?"  

two dudes raised hands. new dilf asked king: "what tattoo was on his chest?"  

king panicked but recovered: "smol blue arrow. easy miss."  

body preppers said "nope." new dilf: "it was P-B-W!" they said "nada."  

crowd lost it: "fraud alert! cancel them! yeet them into the sun!"  

lawyer screeched: "let's dig up the body!"  

mob grabbed us and stormed to the cemetery at 9pm. sky did horror movie filter - lightning, wind, the whole aesthetic. buff dude hines death-gripped me.  

at the grave, no lights but they dug during lightning flashes. when they popped the coffin, lightning lit everything:

“bro deadass found the bag of cash on his chest!”  

hines screamed like the rest, dropped my arm yeeted himself into the crowd to peep, and i ✨disappeared✨ into the night like a minecraft speedrunner.  

had the whole road to myself—well, me + the vibecheck storm: dark mode engaged, lightning doing flashbangs, rain on max volume, wind acting cringe, thunder clapping like a fortnite event. no cap i was zoomin’—nike ad type speed.  

hit the town: streets empty, main character energy. when i saw our crib dark? sus. felt that tiktok “oh no” sound in my soul. but then—plot twist! mary jane’s window did a light flick. my heart did the 😱 emoji irl. house vanished behind me like a snapchat streak—she was the mainest baddie, 10/10 no notes.  

scoped the tow-head from my cliff, hunted for a boat like it was the last ps5. lightning said “free canoe” so i yoinked it. river was giving olympic-level distance but i rowed like my wifi depended on it. hit the raft wheezing like i’d lost a valorant match. screamed:  

“jim! bounce! we’re free my dude!”  

jim came at me arms wide—dripped in king lear cosplay + wet bandit vibes. i yeeted backwards into the water, forgot he was serving drowned rat realness. jim scooped me, ready to uwu over our W, but i said “save the cringe for breakfast! paddle, bro!”  

we slid downriver, vibing on freedom—no cap i did the griddy mid-raft. third heel click? oar sounds. next lightning flash: king & duke pulling up like toxic exes. i folded onto the planks, mentally drafting my goodbye tweet.  

---  

**chapter thirty (clean ver.)**  

king grabbed my collar like a karen at starbucks: “tryna ghost us, lil bro? not vibing with the squad?”  

i cringed: “no ur majesty—pls don’t ratio me!”  

“spill the tea or i’ll cancel u!”  

“fr the guy gripping me was all ‘my son died uwu’—then when they saw the loot, he whispered ‘skedaddle or they’ll cancel u 4eva’ so i naruto ran. told jim to dip before they cuffed me. ask him!”  

jim nodded. king said “sus.” tried to drown me but duke intervened: “let go, boomer! u even look 4 him? cap.”  

king malded, cussed the town. duke dragged him: “u the walking L! only W was that fake tattoo plot—saved us from jail speedrun. rest was cringe.”  

they sat silent. king mumbled: “thought the NPCs stole it.”  

i cringed harder than a 2014 meme.  

duke slow-clapped: “we sure did.”  

king: “...i did.”  

duke: “nope. me.”  

they squared up. duke accused king of pocketing the bag. king choked out “i confess!”  

duke released him: “if u lie again, i’ll yeet u. u let them blame the homies—embarrassing. thought u were my day one.”  

king sniffled: “u said to hide the cash!”  

“silence, skill issue!” duke said. “they took our bread. go mald in the wigwam.”  

king rage-quit to chug cope-juice. soon, duke joined. 30 mins later, they were cuddle-snoring. i whispered the lore to jim.  

---  

**chapter thirty-one (sadge arc)**  

we ghosted towns for days—deep south now, moss hanging like grandpa’s beard filter. frauds tried new grifts:  

- *sober talk*: made $2.50. couldn’t even afford white claws.  
- *dance tutorial*: moved like roblox noobs. got booed offstage.  
- *motivational speaking*: crowd threw verbal tomatoes.  

they flopped at everything—missionary cringe, failed tarot reads. broke af, sat on the raft staring into the void like it’s 3am thoughts.  

then: sus whisper meetings. jim & i side-eyed. “they’re plotting a tiktok heist,” i said. we pinky-swore to dip at first chance.  

hid the raft near pikesville. king went to “scope vibes” (aka rob houses). midday: no king. duke & i went searching—found him in a trap house, drunk-tweeting threats. duke roasted him. they beefed. i ✨disappeared✨ again.  

sprinted to the raft screaming “jim, let’s—” but wigwam empty. screamed, cried, malded. met a kid:  

“seen a sus blk dude?”  

“ya. silas phelps got him. $200 bounty.”  

“ew, i’d never simp for cops,” i lied.  

kid left. i sat, brain buffering. jim—a slave again? after all we’d been through? cringe.  

considered snitching to miss watson. but she’d sell him. plus, i’d get ratioed as a woke lib. my algorithm would flop.  

conscience dm’d me: “u failing the vibe check. god’s watching u cringe.” tried to pray but my soul was on private mode.  

wrote the letter:  

*miss watson—jim @ phelps. cashapp $40 4 him.*  

felt clean, like post-shower selfie. but then flashbacks: jim covering my shifts, hyping me in fog, calling me “king.”  

stared at the letter. hands shook.  

“aight bet. imma yeet myself into hell.” *rip paper.*

those were some toxic vibes fr but i said it out loud. let that marinade in the group chat—zero thoughts about redemption arc. yeeted the whole guilt trip from my mental dashboard like "bet imma main villain again" cuz thats my canon event, raised in the trenches. step one: yeet jim out of slavery part two. if i think of a side quest more unhinged? slay that too—if im locked in this villain era might as well trollmaxx.  

brainstormed stratagems like a discord admin, ping-ponging ideas til i cooked up the most bussin plan. clocked coordinates of a lowkey island downstream, waited til darkmode activated to vibecheck the raft. parked it sneaky-sneak, crashed hard. woke up pre-sunrise, threw on my drip, packed a fit check bundle, yeeted the canoe ashore past phelps spot. hid my swag in the woods like a loot drop, sunk the canoe with extra rocks—bookmarked that spot .25 miles past the lil yeet-yeet sawmill.  

scoped the area sus-style. passed a sign screaming "phelp's grindmill" in comic sans. scanned the farmhouses 300yds ahead—zero npcs despite daylight. didnt want smoke yet, just needed the lore. per my 200iq plan id approach from town later. kept it moving til i spotted the duke gluing up royal nonesuch posters again—audacity level 100. no escape route, he clocks me:  

"bruh—spawn point??" then fake-hype: "where's the raft? secure location?"  

hit him with the uno reverse: "my dude thats literally my line?"  

his vibe curdled. "why you frontin?"  

"well," i said "saw king getting lit at the trap house yesterday—knew hed be zooted for hours. went touch grass simulator til some rando paid me 10c to help boat a sheep cross-river. but when we tried to yank that floof into the boat? glitched out—sheep did a naruto run. no dog meta so we did a genshin impact stamina grind til sunset. finally cuffed it, crossed over, went back to raft—ghosted! deadass cried—lost my main (jim), no loot, no clout. but yo—where the raft at? and jim?? king shit jim??"  

"idfk about the raft—that boomer traded it for 40 bucks then got finessed at dice games. came home zooted—raft gone. figured you yeeted it downstream for the meme."  

"why would i ditch my day one? my only W?"  

"our bad—lowkey claimed him as squad property. no cap we struggled for that king. raft deleted? had to reboot the nonesuch grind. broke as hell—where my 10c?"  

passed him a dime from my stacks, said "buy a hot chip or something—im starving since yesterday." he side-eyed:  

"think jim would snitch? id turn him into a leather jacket."  

"how? he's MIA!"  

"nah—oldhead sold him, kept the bag. jim's ghosted."  

"cappppp" i cried on cue "thats MY legacy character! wheres my king??"  

"seethe—no refunds. btw if you snitch..." he gave me the glazey stare.  

i did the uwu tears "im just tryna find my guy—no snitch9ine here."  

he did the tiktok pondering face. "ayo—we're locked here 3 days. no snitching—ill drop his loc."  

i pinky promised. he said "some farmer named silas ph—" then blue screened. tried to walk it back: "abram foster—40 miles backroad to lafayette."  

"bet—ill speedrun that in 3 days. launchin now."  

"naw fam—go noob. zero dillydally. keep that tiktok shut or catch these hands."  

exactly what i wanted. dipped, faked the backroad grind then doubled back through the sticks toward phelps. needed to no-scope this before duke/duchess cringe could interfere.  

***  

arrived to dead server energy—sunday afternoon lobbies. field workers afk. cicada ASMR max volume—depressioncore. if the wind moved leaves it felt like ghost DMs from 1800s. made you wanna respawn irl.  

phelps base was basic white girl farm: 2-acre fence, log stile steps for horse-queens. yard bald as a 2013 meme. main house: minecraft logs with caulk streaks. kitchen connected by floofy roof bridge. slave cabins line astern. random hut vibing by the ash-hopper. lvl 1 hounds sleeping on benchware.  

parkoured the back stile, approached kitchen. heard spinning wheel—saddest spotify playlist. kms vibes.  

went in raw—no plan, let jesus take the keyboard. halfway there, hound aggro activated. became doge carousel—15 goodbois barking cypher.  

NPC lady yeeted out with rolling pin: "back it up tige! vibe check!" bonked the pack. some stayed for pats—no malinois here.  

lil NPC kids in potato sacks peekaboo'd. then main character: karencore 45yo with spin-stick, white crotchgoblins mimicking. she did the "omg its youuuu" telenovela:  

"slay queen—finally!" autofilled "yes'm"  

she hug-locked me, shook like maraca, cry-laughed: "you look zero like your mom but idc—snackable! kids say hi to cousin tom!"  

they did the shy bean thing. she ordered lize to michelin star me—i lied "already ate on boat." she dragged me to sims house, sat me down for interrogation:  

"gimme that lore dump! why late? boat glitch?"  

"yeah—"  

"say aunt sally bestie! where stuck?"  

paused—didnt know upstream/downstream lore. gambled:  

"not stuck—engine go boom. lost a cylinder head."  

"yikes! casualties?"  

"nah—crispy critter'd a slave."  

"slay ig. remember when uncle silas's boat yeeted a baptist? mans got necrosis—amputate didnt save. turned smurf mode. uncle's in town rn—you missed him?"  

"nope—boat docked at dawn. did sightseeing to avoid early pullup."  

"where's your loot??"  

"hidden op—no griefers."  

"breakfast?"  

"captain fed me cuz i looked malnourished king."  

brain.exe crashing—needed to ID myself via kids. but aunt sally kept yapping:  

"spill the fam tea! sis? everyone?"  

full cringe—committed to the bit:  

*tom sawyer lore unlocked*  

mid fanfic, she shoved me behind bed: "hubby incoming—no peep!"  

old man entered. she trolled "he here?"  

"nope."  

*karen meltdown* "somes wrong! check window!"  

he looked—she yoinked me out. flexed: "ta-da! tom sawyer!"  

i glitched—floorphasing 101. he shook me like maraca 2.0 while she cried cringe. they rapid-fired about sid/mary—  

i ascended. being tom was ezclap. two hours of yapping later, my jaw dislocated from fictional family trauma. explained "boat engine died at white river—3 day fix" which they swallowed like gospel.  

comfort ∞ until i heard steamboat cough. ohshit.jpg—real tom inbound? had to no-clip intercept.  

"brb gonna fetch my loot." uncle tried to chaperone—i said "nah i got horsemanship 100."  

***  

mid wagon grind, spotted another—irl tom sawyer. braked. he looked like backrooms entity:  

"bro i didnt do anything—why haunt me??"  

"im not a ghost—never left."  

he rebooted: "sus. prove it."

"yo don't gaslight me cuz i wouldn't do you like that. deadass fr, you ain't a ghost?"  

"deadass, i ain't," i say.  

"bet—but lowkey my brain's buffering. spill—you weren't canceled for real?"  

"nah. i did a whole fakeout arc. come vibe check me if you pressed."  

he did. mans was shooketh, then big simping—needed the full lore dump cuz it was "peak chaos, unhinged rizz." i said "chill, we'll trauma-bond later." told his uber to dip, we cruised off, explained my whole jim situation. tom's eyes did the anime sparkle thing: "let's yeet him from slavery."  

i glitched out. tom freaking sawyer—honor student, rizzless king—said "let's commit felonies for vibes."  

"bruh," i said, "you trolling."  

"deadass. let's do crime."  

we schemed: he'd haul his trunk in my whip, play it cool rolling up to the house while tom did a dramatic late entry. but then i panicked and zoomed home too fast. uncle silas hyperfixated on the horse: "no cap, this mare's built different—i'd stan for $100 easy. yesterday's price is not today's price!"  

tom pulled up later doing the most—dripped out in his church fit, cosplaying as "william thompson from ohio (derogatory)." aunt sally clocked him from 50 yards: "slay, lize—add a plate, we got a main character alert!"  

tom entered stage left with villain energy, kissed aunt sally unprompted. she screeched "you chaotic gremlin!"  

"my bad," tom said, all uwu. "they said you'd stan."  

"who's 'they'—the voices in your head?!"  

tom side-eyed uncle silas: "you thought she'd fw the rizz, right?"  

silas.exe stopped responding. tom finally broke: "aunt sally—it's me, sid!"  

she full fanboy screamed, hugged him, then side-eyed the theatrics. tom admitted the bit was "cringe but camp."  

dinner was a southern core aesthetic—food so bussin it made uncle's 10-minute prayer worth it. tom and i kept side-eyeing each other, waiting to drop the jim bomb. a kid finally asked about the "owdacious loafers" (the duke and king) getting tarred+feathered. tom whispered "main quest time."  

later, tom's big brain moment: "jim's locked in the rizzless shed. saw a npc take him watermelon—dogs don't eat watermelon, huck. that's cringe."  

i suggested a basic breakout. tom said "mid. needs more lore, secret tunnels, spoon shivs—make it cinematic."  

i couldn't compute why this prep school sweetheart wanted to yassify a felony. "you glitching?"  

"npc behavior," he shrugged. "i do chaotic good now. cope."  

we scouted the shed, found a sus window. i said "easy escape route." tom said "lame. let's dig a tunnel for 7 business days—add trauma bonding."  

he tried climbing the lightning rod like a minecraft parkour fail. finally made it, whispered "skill issue," and we dipped. tom's final line: "this’ll be a whole ao3 fic. prep the drama tags."

we were on demon time at dawn, posted at the servant quarters to boop the doggos and network with the zesty king handling jim’s meal prep—assuming that king was even on jim’s roster. the homies had just demolished their brekkie and were heading to their NPC farming sim when our guy rolled up clutchin’ a drip pan stacked with za and deli meat. as the others bounced, the key got yoinked from the main house.  

this dude had himbo vibes maxed out, his curls sectioned into lil buns secured with embroidery thread—witchcore aesthetic for “warding off bad vibes.” he swore the paranormal girlies were harassing him nightly, making him see glitchy shadow people and hear sus ASMR. “never been this haunted in my life,” he yapped, spiraling into his trauma dump so hard he forgot his whole mission. tom hit him with:  

“snack run for the pups?”  

king did the slowest smirk rollout ever, like watching ketchup leave the bottle, then muttered: “yuh, mars sid—one special pup. wanna peep?”  

“bet.”  

i elbowed tom, whisper-yelling: “daylight mission? that’s not the lore.”  

“retconning the lore. it’s canon now.”  

ugh, cringe. we followed but my spidey-senses were tingling. inside the shack was darker than my dms, but jim clocked us immediately:  

“huck?! no cap! tom?!”  

i knew it. knew he’d fumble. before i could yeet a cover story, the zesty king gasped:  

“y’all know each other?!”  

tom hit him with the 🤨 face, all faux-confused: “who knows us?”  

“dis runaway king!”  

“doubt it. why you tweakin’?”  

“he just shouted y’all’s government names!”  

tom, channeling theater kid energy: “spill the tea—who shouted? when? how?” turning to me deadpan: “you hear anything?”  

trapped. i sighed: “nope. silence.”  

he side-eyed jim like a stranger: “you yell?”  

“nah sir,” jim played along. “quiet as a church mouse.”  

“not a peep?”  

“nossir.”  

“ever seen us before?”  

“can’t say i have.”  

tom whipped back to the panicking king, stern-dadding him: “what’s your damage, my guy? hallucinating much?”  

“it’s the ghosties, sir! they’re bullying me! pls don’t snitch—mars silas says they’re cap, but i’m dying over here!”  

tom palmed him a dub, swore secrecy, told him to cop more thread for his protective lewks. then stared at jim, musing:  

“wonder if silas gonna cancel this king. if i caught a homie mid-skedaddle? no snitching—i’d ctrl-alt-delete him myself.” while zesty king admired his shiny new dub, tom hissed to jim:  

“play dumb. if you hear us rizzling the dirt at night? that’s the jailbreak DLC loading.”  

jim just squeezed our hands before zesty king returned. we promised to revisit—preferably after dark, “when the ghosties rage,” king begged.  

---  

CHAPTER XXXV.  

still mad hours till waffle house vibes, so we dipped into the woods. tom insisted we needed “ambient lighting”—lanterns too main character, so we grabbed that glow-in-the-dark fungi (foxfire, but make it cottagecore) and stashed it in the weeds. tom sulked:  

“this quest is too easy. zero guards to roofie, no guard doggo to benadryl. jim’s literally chained to his bed with a 10-foot stanley cup strap—just lift the frame and *yoink*. uncle silas trusts everyone, gave the key to this himbo. jim could’ve yeeted out the window ages ago if the chain wasn’t cringe. huck, this is weaksauce. we gotta invent the drama. honor’s in overcoming non-existent obstacles, y’know? like the lantern—gotta pretend it’s sus. could’ve used a whole rave torch. oh! we need a saw.”  

“why?”  

“to cut jim’s bed leg, duh.”  

“but you just said lift it—”  

“huck! didn’t you speedrun any prison escape lore? baron trenck? casanova? you can’t just *lift*—that’s baby mode. real ones saw the leg, swallow the sawdust, grease the cut. then kick it during escape o’clock, chain slips, yeet the rope ladder, break your leg in the nonexistent moat—iconic. wish this shack had a moat. maybe dig one pre-escape.”  

“why moat when we’re tunneling?”  

he ignored me, maladaptive daydreaming. sighed.  

“nvm. no need to saw jim’s leg.”  

“thank god—why?!”  

“european kings did it, but jim’s not culturally ready. rope ladder tho—gotta shred our bedsheets. sneaky-deliver via sneaky pie. i’ve eaten worse.”  

“jim can’t use a ladder—”  

“huck! it’s for the vibes. he hides it under his mattress as an easter egg. no clues? cringe. regulations demand it.”  

“aunt sally’s gonna kill us—”  

“hickory bark isn’t cinematic. be so fr.”  

later, tom added: “borrow a shirt too—jim needs a journal.”  

“he’s illiterate!”  

“he’ll carve morse code with a spoon shiv. prison rules: no goose pens, only struggle tools. ink? blood, obviously. messages on tin plates—iron mask style.”  

“he eats from a pan—”  

“we’ll manifest plates. readability? not the point. it’s ✨ambiance✨.”  

breakfast horn yeeted our convo.  

later, i “borrowed” (tom: “it’s not stealing if you’re escaping jail! lore accurate!”) sheets, a shirt, and bagged foxfire. he malded when i swiped a melon: “only steal plot-relevant items!”  

---  

CHAPTER XXXVI.  

midnight grind: we rod-slid to the lean-to, cleared a 5-foot workspace under jim’s bed. tom monologued: “hole stays hidden under his blankie. vibes immaculate.”  

we dug with butter knives til our hands looked like raw chicken. i groaned: “this ain’t 37 years—it’s 38.”  

tom blue-screened. “this ain’t it. prisoners get decades, we got days. hands are wrecked. gotta switch to pickaxes but gaslight ourselves it’s knives.”  

“tom—that’s cringe.”  

“shhh. canon is a construct.”

"slay king spittin' straight fax!" i'm like; "your glizzy finally glitching right," i tell tom sawyer, "picks goated fr—idgaf 'bout mid ethics. when i yeet a homie or a za or some cringe bible flex, i'm sending it full yolo. just need my blud, my watermelon glow-up, my sunday school clout—if pick's easiest L, imma minecraft that ish out. zero chill for hall monitors malding."  

tom side-eyes me: "lowkey valid for this rizz-less scenario—otherwise i'd ratio that weak play. you can bedrock jim out no cap, NPC behavior—but me? nah i'm built different. hand me the case-knife."  

he throws mine back like "ick." i dig through crusty tools, toss him a pickaxe. king starts grinding silent—all "sigma grindset" unbothered.  

we tag-team digging for 30 mins, arms dead af. peep tom later struggling with lightning rod, hands shredded. he's like "this mid. what's the play now bro?"  

"come thru window but make it ✨aesthetic✨," i say. king eats it up.  

next day tom swipes a spoon & candlestick for "jim's prison tiktok crafts." i yoink tin plates—tom says "mid effort" but i'm like "they'll yeet into the skibidi weeds—free respawn lol."  

night mission: we jimmy open the vibe checkpoint, yeet a candle in (king sleeps thru it). crawl under bed, wake jim gentle. he's so emo: "fam! let's sigma out rn!" but tom's all "nah this ain't lore accurate—we doing escape room deluxe edition." lays out whole fanfic plot.  

jim's confused but trusts the rizz. we vibe, tom q&a's him 'bout aunt sally's prayers. tom's eyes sparkle: "we'll dead drop supplies via NPCs—pocket ops, apron heists, journaling w/ blood (stan loona)." jim's like "this unhinged but slay."  

noodle arms post-dig. tom's amped: "this bussin! let's keep this arc for 80 seasons—generational trauma rizz!"  

morning: we craft shivs from candlesticks. tom shoves one in jim's cornbread—king bites down, almost loses teef. jim plays it cool like "just crunchypillowcore."  

sudden DOG SWARM in jim's crib—we forgot to lock lean-to door. nat screams "DEMONSSSS," faints. tom yeets meat, resets spawn. gaslights nat: "u seeing shadow people again?"  

nat's shook: "saw 1M hellhounds! need a witchussy pie plz 🥺" tom's all "bet—i'll cottagecore bake it. but no peeking our lore drops, or cursed."  

chapter 37: we upcycle trash into pie tin, stuff it with stolen flour. tom plants nails sus places. aunt sally enters BEEF MODE over missing shirt. i choke on cornbread, yeet it—hits kid. chaos.  

uncle silas fumbles spoon from pocket. sally's malding: "world ending! shirt, sheet, spoon, candles—"  

"brass candlestick gone too," a maid says. sally threatens skillet. i'm ready to forest arc.  

silas tries "i was bibleposting—" sally banshes us: "TOUCH GRASS ALL OF YOU."  

tom clocks silas dropping nail, mutters "he's NPC lootbox. we'll fix his rat glitches." we seal holes for 1hr. silas later: "can't remember patching... rats W tho."  

spoon heist: tom gaslights sally's count. i palm one—she counts 9, we "find" 10. repeat till she ragequits: "i'll skin you nerds!" we plant spoon on her—jim scores it + nail.  

bed sheet trolling: steal/return til she gives up. tom cackles "she'll never math again—full dementia arc."  

candlestick drama? skill issue. we vibin.

bruh that pie was straight mid af, took us forever to glow-up. we set up shop deep in the skibidi woods, baked it there, ended up using three whole ahh pans of flour, got third-degree rizz burns everywhere, eyes leaking from smoke. kept flopping like a degen cheugy simpcake til we big brained it—yeet the whole ahh ladder into the pie? slay. next night we vibed with jim, shredded a bedsheet into rizzler strings, had a noose-tier rope by 3am. told jim it took "9 business months" to craft.  

mfs tried to stuff the whole ahh rope into one pie—ngl it was enough for 40 pies plus a side quest soup. tom: "we only need that sigma male portion" so we yeeted the rest. couldn’t risk the pan melting, so we swiped uncle silas’s ancestral brass pan (his rizzler ancestor brought it on the mayflower lowkey). first few pies were Ls but the last one? bussin. crust looked fire but eatin’ it would make you wish for a dentist arc.  

nat wasn’t sus when we slid jim the pie—hid the ladder in his straw bed, scratched messages on tin plates like "wyd?" tossed it out the window.  

making the pens and saw? absolute skill issue. jim kept malding about the "prisoner grindset" inscriptions. tom pulled main character energy: "jim you NEED heraldry—it’s a canon event!" jim: "i ain’t got no coat of arms bro i’m literally wearing a potato sack." tom invented the most extra ahh design: "doggos chillin’ on chains, sussy snakes, latin gibberish—stole it from wattpad." huck: "my guy what does any of this even MEAN?" tom: "vibes. now let’s trauma-dump some epitaphs."  

tom wrote cringe emo captions like "here king shit’s heart got ratioed" and almost cried. jim: "i can’t scribble all this—i don’t even know cursive!" tom said we’d carve it into a rock instead. found a grindstone at the sus mill, almost died moving it—jim had to break character to help. tom micromanaged like a discord mod.  

then tom tried to gaslight jim into adoptin’ rattlesnakes. jim: "absolutely not, that’s how you get unalived speedrun any%." settled for garter snakes with button rattles. added rats for "aesthetic"—jim had to play juice harp trauma jams to vibecheck them. tom: "it’s lore accurate!"  

when aunt sally found the rats we yeeted? big mad. she whooped us with a chancla. we restocked spiders, almost died harvesting a hornet nest (they were home 💀), then snakes dipped from our half-fast knot. aunt sally kept screaming every time one slinked near her—tom said "women ☕" like the little rizzler he was.  

jim had to water a weed with "trauma tears" but used tap instead. tom malded about "wasted rizz opportunities." whole time jim’s journal entries were "day 37: why am i like this." we collapsed into bed dreaming of prison tiktok clout.  

next day copped a rat trap, filled it with gyatt rodents. lil timmy let them loose in aunt sally’s room—she did a whole tiktok scream comp. we got whooped again. snakes kept doing drive-bys on her plates—she’d yeet outta there like "nope! nope! nope!" tom nodded sagely: "females built diff, no cap."

we got clapped every time one of our snekky bois slid past aunt sally, and she kept screechin' these punishments were just a warmup if we ever turned jim's crib into a reptile rave again. lowkey didn't care about the beatdowns—they were mid—but restocking the critter collection? absolute grind. when they all popped off for their daily jam sesh tho? jim's cabin was lit af. jim wasn't vibin' with the spiders (spider gang said L + ratio back), so they'd ambush him 24/7. dude said between the rat pack, sneks, and the yeet stone, his bed was more crowded than a tiktok meetup. "can't even nap fr," he'd say, "cuz they run shifts—rats on nightwatch, sneks on dawn patrol. if i yeet outta bed? spider jump scares." swore he'd never do the prison arc again, not even for vbucks.  

three weeks deep, our operation was bussin. sent the shirt via sus pie delivery. every time a rat nommed jim, he'd scribble in his trauma diary with fresh rat-ink. carved the grindstone flexes, sawed the bed leg (ate the sawdust like dumbasses—got that tummy apocalypse). tom said it was "the most undigestible fiber ever," which—facts.  

anyway, mission almost done but we were all zooted—especially jim. the kingpin tried mailing "come get your lost npc" letters to non-existent plantations, then started talkin' bout st. louis newspapers. i started panickin'—tom hit me with "yo, time for the anon letters."  

"say sike rn," i said.  

"nah fam—phantom DMs to tip off the feds. historical accuracy! when louis xvi tried to dip, some pickme girl snitched. we're doin' that + mother-son outfit swap. standard prisonbreak protocol."  

"but why warn em? let 'em mald!"  

"bro they're NPCs—zero situational awareness. if we don't script this drama, our whole escape'll flop like a default dance. gotta make it cineMATIC."  

(shooketh by his commitment to the bit)  

later, i had to yomp as the servant girl. tom said "yoink aunt sally's drip for jim's mom costume." argued about stealth mechanics—"principle of the thing, huck! do it for the aesthetic!"  

we dropped the anon note:  

*⚠️ ur in danger, sis. stay woke. - mysterious ally*  

next night: blood-drawn skull emoji on the front door. then a coffin emoji out back. aunt sally was having full beef with ghosts—jumped at every yeet, spun like a fidget spinner yellin "OUCH!" tom said "this is premium content."  

cue final boss move: next morning's letter (planted on a sleeping guard) said:  

*pls dont snitch—gang from fortnite gonna yoink your slave tn. im reformed now. they'll pull up @ midnight. i'll sheep-ba instead of alarm. lock em in & style on em. no cap. - mysterious ally*  

CHAPTER XL (no cap)  

post-breakfast swag: took the canoe, fished, checked the raft. came back to aunt sally full tweakin'—made us sleep early. we yeeted to the snack stash, waited till 11:30. tom dressed as sally, forgot the butter.  

"where's the glizzy glaze?"  

"left it on cornbread—"  

"that's a you problem. slide to the basement."  

got caught mid-quest. butter hunk in my hat drippin' like a glazed donut. aunt sally saw the grease waterfall, screamed "brain fever!", snatched my hat—bread avalanche. "why u no say u wanted snack? jfc—go to bed!"  

zoomed out via lightning rod. jim dressed, tom stuffing straw decoy. farmers with AR-15 energy surrounded the house. i sat shaking, butter becoming my villain origin story. aunt sally interrogated me as farmers debated raid strats.  

butter dripped down my forehead—sally yelped "HIS BRAINS ARE LEAKING!" snatched my hat, saw the snackn't, cried "just ask for food next time smh."  

dipped to the raft. tom's pants snagged on the fence—*SNAP*. farmers: "RATTLED!" Sent shots flying. we booked it river-ward, dogs barking—but they were our dogs (plot twist). hit the canoe, vibed to the raft.  

"jim ur free my g!"  

"no cap huck, that escape was straight fire—most rizzmatic plan ever."  

tom was hyped despite bullet in calf. jim & i said "medic!" tom argued "keep evading!" we folded: "bruh ur leaking HP—doctor or report."  

tom malded but gave doctor instructions:  

"blindfold him, make him swear on minecraft, stuff his pockets with vbucks, take the scenic route, & steal his chalk so he can't mark us. standard ops."  

CHAPTER XLI (sussy epilogue)  

doctor was old but chill. i said "my brother dream-shot himself lmao." he side-eyed hard but followed. saw the canoe: "this looks mad sketch." i said "skill issue"—paddled into the yeetzone.

"oh you good fam, no cap—she could fit three of us easy vibes."  

"what three?"  

"like me n sid n—n—n the glocks; ya feel me?"  

"bet," he goes.  

but he steps on the edge n rocks it, side-eyes it n goes "ion trust it—imma find a bigger flex." but all the boats were on lock, so he yoinks my kayak n tells me to wait or maybe slide home n prep the surprise. i was like "nah," n told him where the raft's at n he dipped.  

then i had a galaxy brain moment. i’m like—yo what if fixing tom’s leg takes mad days? we just gonna post here til he snitches? nah. imma wait n if he tries to ghost again, imma full-send into the river, tie his a** up, n float him downstream. when tom’s done clout chasing him, we’ll zelle him whatever n bounce.  

i crashed in a lumber stack, woke up to the sun blasting. zoomed to the doc’s spot but they said he dipped late night—still MIA. big L for tom, so i yeeted toward the island. turned a corner n almost ate uncle silas’s gut. he goes:  

"tom! where you been, my guy? auntie’s tweakin’!"  

"just chasin’ that runner—me n sid," i lied.  

"where’d y’all even go?"  

"we’re vibin’. followed the pack but they zoinked us. thought we heard ‘em cross water, so we copped a canoe n sent it. found nada, cruised shore til we crashed. sid’s at the post office rn n i’m snaggin’ snacks."  

we went to fetch "sid" but—shocker—he wasn’t there. uncle grabbed mail n said "let sid walk home—we ridin’." couldn’t argue. aunt sally saw me n did the cry-laugh-hug combo, then fake-slapped me like "wait til sid gets this!"  

the crib was packed w/ locals yappin’ at dinner. mrs. hotchkiss was on demon time: "sis phelps—that cabin’s a whole meme. that runner’s unhinged! peep the grindstone scribbles—mf wrote a whole fanfic! son of louis? nebuchadnezzar vibes fr. n the rag ladder? sus af!"  

mrs. damrell co-signed: "how’d they even move that grindstone? no cap, they had a whole discord server helpin’! case knives sawin’ the bed? took weeks! straw dummy on the bed? next-level trolling."  

brer hightower added: "there’s blood scribbles on that shirt—straight up hieroglyphic clout. i’d venmo $2 to decode it."  

aunt sally vented: "they stole everything—my dress, spoons, the whole vibe! we had 16 dudes n 22 dogs n they still ghosted us! our dobermans didn’t even bark. they’re hacking fr—or ghosts!"  

the crowd gasped:  

"yikes—"  

"i’d have peed—"  

"house haunted af—"  

aunt sally trauma dumped: "i locked the boys in their room! imagine bein’ a kid, door unlocked, demons lurkin’—" she paused, side-eyed me, n i ghosted to brainstorm alibis.  

later, i spun her a story: "the gunshots woke us, door was locked, so we parkoured down the lightning rod. got scuffed, never again." she cried n said "boys gonna boy," kissed my head, n sighed:  

"sid’s still missing? big sad."  

i tried: "i’ll fetch him!"  

"nope. uncle’ll go."  

uncle came back empty. auntie stressed, but he said "tom’ll respawn by dawn." she kept a light on n tucked me in, so wholesome i felt guilty. she sobbed about sid drowning or dying, n i lied "he’s chillin’," til she slept at the window, candle melted, head on hand.  

——  

**chapter 42**  

uncle silas failed his sid side-quest. at breakfast, they gloomed over cold coffee. he goes:  

"did i give you the mail?"  

"nope."  

he found a letter from "sis" in st. pete, but aunt sally yeeted it when tom arrived—pale on a stretcher, jim in cuffs n a dress. i hid the letter n sprinted.  

auntie screamed "he’s dead!" but tom mumbled—she sobbed "he’s alive!" n sprinted to prep his bed. the mob wanted to cancel jim, but some said "his owner’s gonna sue," so they just cuffed him tighter.  

the doc defended jim: "he helped save tom—risked freedom for it. W ngl." the crowd softened, promised no more hate, but still locked jim up.  

i needed to explain sid’s "gunshot" lie but dodged uncle silas. next day, tom was better. i tried to scheme w/ him, but aunt sally caught me. she whispered "he’s healing," n we vibed til tom woke.

so we posted up watching, and dude finally twitches a lil, cracks his eyes open like "bruh?" and goes:  

"yo? why tf am i in my crib? where's the raft @?"  

"all gucci," i say.  

"and jim?"  

"vibing," i say, but lowkey sus. he didn't clock it tho, just:  

"slay! absolute W! we made it no cap! you told aunty?"  

i was finna say yeet, but she cuts in like "abt what, sid?"  

"abt the whole mission! the main quest!"  

"what mission?"  

"the jim thing! how we yeeted that king outta slavery—me n tom."  

"free the—? is this kid high rn? someone check his wifi connection fr."  

"nah i'm zooted on facts! we did the thing—me n tom. big brain ops, weeks of grind, midnights clouted on stolen candles n ur bedsheets n spoons?? had to 3D-print fake shackles n write cringe ransom notes in comic sans, do parkour on the lightning rod, diggy diggy hole in the wall—"  

"omfg—"  

"—then we flooded his room with rats n snek for ✨ambience✨. u almost blew our cover keeping tom caked up in butter hat drip—dudes rolled up early, popped shots, we naruto-ran to the canoe, jim's free now! we ate that, no crumbs!"  

aunty sally.exe stopped working: "y'all caused this whole tiktok drama?? i’ll cancel ur avatars rn! wait till ur hp refills—imma unlock the belt of doom on both y’all!"  

tom’s ego doing backflips, yapping 1000wpm while she’s malding—chaos max. she snaps:  

"enjoy ur clout now, but if i catch u messing with him again—"  

"messing with who?" tom fake gapes.  

"the runaway homie, duh!"  

tom side-eyes me heavy: "bro u said he was chillin? he ain’t free?"  

"free?" aunty sally scoffs. "they cuffed him again! bread n water diet, locked in sims 4 basement mode!"  

tom sits up like he’s buffering: "that’s cap! let him OUT! he’s not a slave—old miss watson died cringe, freed him in her will n everything!"  

"then why’d u play escape room sim??"  

"for the plot twist! i’d walk thru a minefield of legos for the lore—HOLY SKYRIUM, AUNT POLLY??"  

and there she was, materializing like a taylor swift jumpscare, glowin like she mainlined starbucks. aunty sally glitched into hug.exe while i yeeted myself under the bed.  

aunt polly stares tom down like he’s a 1-star yelp review: "should’ve stayed incognito, tom."  

aunty sally short-circuits: "sid?? where’s tom—wait, where’s HUCK?"  

"sis that’s huck cosplaying tom," aunt polly sighs. "come out, huckster."  

i crawled out, big oof energy.  

aunty sally n uncle silas did the confused pikachu face irl. aunt polly lore-dumped everything: how miss watson freed jim, how tom did all that extra for clout. i explained my tom-sawyer-arc—aunt sally’s like "call me aunty, i’m trauma-bonded now."  

tom’s aunt polly dragged him: "i dmed u twice abt sid being here!"  

"no cap, didn’t get notifs," aunty sally says.  

"check ur spam folder, tom," aunt polly sus.  

"letters? oh those? vibin in the trunk—thought they’d start beef. my b?"  

"ur b? i’ll b ur funeral—"  

the plot armor held. jim got un-cuffed, tom tossed him $40 for carryin the stream. jim’s like "told u i’d hit that bag! hairy chest = sigma grindset!" tom’s already scripting their next LARP: "let’s wild out in the metaverse—native american arc, twitch sponsorships!"  

i’m like "i’m broke tho."  

tom: "ur 6k’s still chillin. ur dad’s MIA."  

jim gets ominous: "he ain’t comin back, huck."  

"why?"  

"member that dead guy floatin in the house? that was him. gg no re."  

tom’s flexin his bullet pendant like it’s ap drip. aunty sally’s tryna adopt me—nah fam, i’m ghostin to the territories. ✌️ out, huck finn.
