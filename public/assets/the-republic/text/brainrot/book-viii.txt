book viii.

so, glaucon, we’ve landed on the idea that in the perfect state, the wifely squad and kiddos are all shared out; and that all education, along with the hustle of war and peace, is communal—with the dopest philosophers and the bravest warriors ruling as kings?

that, glaucon replied, is already a given.

yep, i said; and we also agreed that when the govern squad is crowned, they roll out their soldiers and plug them into living digs like we described—totally communal, with zero private flex—and about their property, remember what we decided?

yeah, i recall: no one’s allowed those basic human property vibes; they’re gonna be warrior-athlete guardians, getting from the citizens just enough maintenance instead of big annual payouts, and they gotta handle themselves and the whole state.

facts, i said; and now that we’ve split our agenda, let’s circle back to where we left off, so we can get back on the OG track.

coming back is easy—you hinted then, as now, that u had wrapped up the state deets: u said that such a state was lit, and that the guy who vibes with it is dope, though, as it turns out, u had even cooler heat to drop about both the state and the man. and u even said that if this is the real vibe, then all other forms are fake; and among the fakes, u mentioned, if i remember right, that there are four main types, with flaws in both the systems and the dudes running them that are totally worth a deep dive. after scoping all the individuals, and finally agreeing on who’s the goated and who’s trash, we were gonna compare whether the goated one is also the happiest, and the trashiest the most miserable. i asked u about these four government forms, then polemarchus and adeimantus chimed in, and u got back on track to the point we’re at now.

your recall is on point, i said.

then, like a boss wrestler, he replied, “u gotta jump back in that zone; let me drop the same q’s and see if u still hit me with the same fire u were about to drop back then.”

“yes, if i can, i will,” i said.

i’m super keen to peep what the four constitutions u were dissing are.

that question, i said, is an easy drip: the four governments with distinct names are, first, those of crete and sparta—the OG vibes everyone claps for; next up is oligarchy, which isn’t the crowd favorite and is loaded with shady evils; third is democracy, which naturally pops off after oligarchy but on an entirely diff energy; and lastly, the ultimate trash-tier: tyranny, famous for being hella different and the worst disorder in a state. i dunno, u feel me? is there any other constitution that’s got its distinct drip? sure, there are lordships and principalities that get traded around, and some mid-way forms, but those are bland and pop up equally among hellenes and barbarians.

yea, he replied—we straight up hear about a bunch of wild government styles from them.

u know, i said, that governments flip just like people’s vibes vary—and that there gotta be as many state styles as there are human dispositions. we can’t assume states are just built out of cold “oak and rock” without that raw human juice influencing everything, tilting the scales and dragging extra traits along.

yea, he said, states are literally as the peeps are—they grow straight from human characters.

so, if the constitutions of states number five, then the different individual mind vibes also break into five?

certainly.

the one who vibes with aristocracy—and whom we rightly call just and good—has already been described.

we have.

then let’s roll into dishing on the lower-tier vibes: the contentious, ambitious types rolling with the spartan energy; plus the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical crews. let’s line up the most just against the most unjust so we can scope which life is actually lit—the life of pure justice versus that of straight-up injustice misery. then our Q is answered, and we know if we should chase injustice, like thrasymachus suggests, or stick with justice as our convo’s conclusion.

for sure, he replied, we gotta do it that way.

shall we stick to our OG plan for clarity—first breaking down the state, then diving into the individual—starting with the government of honor? i mean, i can’t think of another name for that vibe besides timocracy (or maybe timarchy). then we’ll flex by comparing that same energy in the individual; after that, we’ll map out oligarchy and the oligarchical dude; next, we’ll peep democracy and its corresponding vibe; and lastly, we’ll scope out the city of tyranny, dive into the tyrant’s soul, and drop a verdict that actually makes sense.

that method for vibing on and judging the matter is totally on point.

first off, i said, let’s dig into how timocracy (that honor-based government) pops off from aristocracy (the rule of the best). clearly, all political shake-ups start from splits in the actual governing power—a squad that’s united, no matter how small, just can’t be moved.

deadass, he said.

so, how exactly is our city gonna get stirred up, and in what way will the two crews—the auxiliaries and the rulers—clash with each other? should we, homer-style, hit up the muses and ask ‘how did discord first go down?’ should we picture them roasting us like we’re kids, dropping epic tragic vibes while pretending to be all serious?

how would they even drop that address?

here’s how they’d spit it: a city built like this is hella stable, but yo, since every beginning’s got its end, even a dope constitution like yours won’t last forever—it’ll eventually get clapped and break apart. and here’s the lowdown: just like plants growing in the dirt and animals flexing on the ground, the vibes of fertility versus barrenness hit hard when the circle’s complete—short-lived lives wrap up fast, and long-lived ones take way longer. but no matter how much wisdom or schooling your rulers snag, they can’t fully decode the crazy human juice of being fertile or not; the laws that run that show are always just outta reach, and they’ll end up popping off kiddos when they really shouldn’t. now, stuff that’s divinely birthed vibes on a perfect number—think of a cyclical number like 6 (which equals the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3, so when the cycle of 6 is done, the mini rotations of 1, 2, and 3 are wrapped up too)—but human birth rhythms are calculated in a number that evolves with squared and cubed moves, splitting into three intervals and four segments—numbers waxing and waning so all pieces sync up. (probably the numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6, where the first three form the sides of the pythagorean triangle; then you get 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, which together equal 6 cubed, or 216). the base number 3, plus adding a one-third to make 4, when mixed with 5 (totaling 20) and then cubed, gives two harmonies: the first, a square that’s a hundred times as big (400 = 4 × 100) (or a 100 × 100 square equal to 10,000, making the whole number 17,500—a square of 100 and an oblong of 100 by 75), and the other, a shape with one side matching the first but oblong, formed of a hundred numbers squared on rational diameters of a square (skipping fractions), with the side being 5 (like 7 × 7 = 49 × 100 = 4900), each off by one (compared to the perfect square including fractions, roughly 50) or less by (or “made of two numbers squared on irrational diameters,” etc. = 100—see the introduction for more tea) two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square with side 5 = 50 + 50 = 100); plus a hundred cubes of three (27 × 100 = 2700, and then add 4900 + 400 to hit 8000). now, this beast of a number is like a geometric cheat code that controls the good and bad in births. cuz when your guardians are clueless about the law of births and hook up bridezillas and grooms outta season, the kiddos come out all kinds of off—neither fresh nor lucky. and even if only the top-tier get picked by their elders, they still won’t be worthy of filling their dads’ shoes; and once they scoop up the guardian gig, it won’t be long before they flunk at keeping us, the muses, on point—starting by lowkey dissing music, which then spills over to gym class, leaving the youth of your state far less cultured. in the next generation, new rulers will pop up who’ve lost that guardian vibe of testing the metal of your mixed races—which, like hesiod’s breakdown, come in gold, silver, brass, and iron. and soon enough, iron gets mixed with silver, brass with gold, sparking dissimilarity, inequality, and a total irregular mess, which is always the lowkey fuel for hate and war. the muses are all like, “that’s the OG sauce from which all discord has bubbled up, no matter where you look,” and that’s their drop to us.

facts, and we can assume they’re spitting straight truth.

why, yes, i said—duh, of course they’re real; how can the muses ever cap?

so, what’s the next tea from the muses?

they say that when discord hit, the two crews got split: the iron and brass types went all out hustling for money, land, houses, gold, and silver; while the gold and silver crew, not chasing cash but already packing true inner riches, leaned into virtue and that old-school order. there was an epic showdown between them, and finally they agreed to divvy up the land and houses into individual chunks; plus, they flipped the script on their own homies—those friends and protectors they once kept free—turning them into subjects and servants, all while they themselves stayed busy waging war and keeping vigilant against any heat.

i feel like u totally caught the origin of the switch-up.

so, this new government that drops—will it be a hybrid between oligarchy and aristocracy?

deadass true.

that’s the switch—and once the change is locked in, what next? obviously, the new state, chillin’ in between oligarchy and the perfect state, will be like a hybrid: picking up moves from both while throwing in some offbeat quirks.

true, he said.

in how much the rulers get honored, in the way the warrior squad chills out from basic farming, handicrafts, or trading, in that whole scene of communal meals, and in the mad focus on gym workouts and military drills—the new state will have mad throwback vibes to the OG style.

facts.

but then, there’s that extra twist: they get shook by the fear of letting philosophers take the reins, ‘cause these peeps aren’t coming through all pure and simple anymore—they’re now a mix of vibes; and that shift moves them toward more hot-headed, less layered types, naturally built more for brawls than for peace; plus, they’ll be all about military stratagems and constant wars—making this state hella offbeat and unique.

yea.

so there it is.

yeah, i said; and dudes of this vibe are gonna be mad thirsty for that paper, just like the oligarch crowd; they’ll have that savage, secret flex for gold and silver, stashing their loot in sketchy spots, with their own drip magazines and secret treasuries for hiding the bag; and oh, they’ll cop castles that are basically just cribs for their eggs, where they blow stacks on their bae or any other squad they vibe with.

that’s legit true, he said.

and they're hella stingy 'cause they can't just flex open ways to bag their coin; they'll blow someone else's currency to feed their wild cravings, snatch their vibes, and yeet away like kids dodging daddy's rulebook. they've been schooled on hardcore force, ghosting that real muse of reason and philosophy, while flexing hard on gym grind over chill tunes.

undoubtedly, he said, the government you're outlining is basically a remix of good vibes and shady moves.

yup, there's a dope mix, i said; but there's literally one vibe that's extra prominent—the vibe of hella flexing and drama; and that's straight up thanks to that blazing passionate energy.

facts, he said.

so, which type of dude vibes with this style of gov—like, how did he level up, and what's his drip like?

i think, said adeimantus, that with all that tussle energy he rocks, he's lowkey like our homie glaucon.

maybe, i said, he's similar on that one flex; but on other deets, he's totally on a different meme.

in what ways, tho?

he should be all about self-confidence, less highbrow and bookish, yet still a cultural homie; he’s gonna be a top-tier listener without being a chatterbox. this type tends to be rough on his underlings—unlike the super educated who are too extra for that—and he’s polite to the freemen, lowkey obedient to the big bosses. he’s all about power and honor, claiming the ruler title not 'cause he's got mad eloquence, but 'cause he's a soldier out here flexing real battle feats; plus, he's down for gym sesh and chasing the thrill of the hunt.

exactly, that's the type that vibes with timocracy.

this dude will scoff at riches when he's young; but as he levels up, he'll get lowkey obsessed with stacking paper, 'cause a slice of that greedy vibe’s deep inside him, and he ain't fully locked on virtue, having ghosted his top muse.

who was that? asked adeimantus.

philosophy, i said, spiced up with music that slides into a man's soul and stands as the sole lifesaver for his virtue on the daily.

good, he said.

yup, i said, that's the timocratic youth – totally the mirror image of the timocratic state.

exactly.

his origin goes down like this: he's usually the young kid of a brave af father, living in a city that's totally sus and mismanaged. the old dude declines honors and offices, dodges court drama, and is ready to dip on his rights just to avoid any beef.

and how does the son level up?

the kid's vibe starts evolving when he hears his mom griping that her man has zero clout in the gov game, which leaves her with no rep among the lady squad. then she sees him not hyped for stacking coins—choosing to ride the waves in court or assembly with chill vibes instead—and notices his brain's always on his own flex while he straight up ghosts her. she gets major sus and tells her son that his dad is like only half a real man and way too laid-back, dropping all that extra tea about her suffering that women love to spill.

yeah, said adeimantus, they serve up mad tea, and their whining is total self-reflection.

and, yo, i said, the old servants, supposed to be tight with the fam, sometimes slide into one-on-one chats with the kid; and if they peep anyone who owes coin to his dad or is lowkey jacking him, and the dad ain't calling them out, they straight up tell the kid that when he levels up, he's gotta clap back on those types and be a real man—more so than his old man. he only needs to step out and he'll see the same drama everywhere: those doing their own hustle in the city get labeled as noobs, while the nosy ones get mad props. so, soaking all that in—along with his dad's own words and close-up lifestyle comparisons—he's pulled in as many directions; while his dad's watering that rational vibe in his soul, the rest are hyping up the wild, passionate, and hungry juices. since the kid wasn’t originally a bad egg but rolled with sketchy peeps, their combined influence eventually drags him to the middle, letting that beef and passion vibe rule his inner kingdom, turning him straight-up arrogant and extra.

yo, you just described his starting kit perfectly.

so now, i said, are we looking at the second form of gov and the next character archetype?

we do.

next, let's check out another dude who, as aeschylus says, "is set over against another state;" or, per our plan, let's start with the state.

all good.

i'm thinking oligarchy is next on deck.

so, what swag of gov do you label oligarchy?

it's a gov all about that property drip, where the rich run the show and the broke get totally ghosted.

i feel that, he replied.

shouldn't i first break down how timocracy morphs into oligarchy?

yep.

well, i said, you literally don't need a magnifying glass to see how one transitions into the other.

how so?

stacking up gold in private vaults spells doom for timocracy; they start cooking up shady hustle moves to drop cash, since like, why would they or their bae ever care about the law?

for sure.

and then, when one sees his homie get rich, he jumps in to level up, so the majority become total money junkies.

big facts.

so they keep stacking while virtue gets left on read; on the balance, as one goes up, the other takes a nosedive.

true af.

and the more the state hypes the rich, the more virtue and the righteous get totally dissed.

clearly.

and those clout-worthy get groomed, while what doesn't get the hype just gets ghosted.

that's straight-up obvious.

and so eventually, instead of vibing on conflict and glory, dudes swap it for the hustle of trade and cash; they hype up the rich, anointing them as rulers, while dissing the broke.

exactly.

next up, they draft a law setting a coin threshold for citizenship – with the bar varyin' by spot, based on how exclusive the oligarchy is – and anyone with less stash than the set amount gets totally excluded from ruling. these constitution tweaks are enforced by straight-up force, if not pure intimidation.

very true.

and so, in a nutshell, that's how the whole oligarchy vibe gets established.

yeah, he said; but what are the key deets of this gov form, and what are its major flaws we were talking about?

first up, i said, consider the coin qualification. imagine if pilots were picked based solely on their bank, and a broke dude got benched, even if he was a far better flyer?

mean, they'd totally crash, right?

yep, and isn't that a fact of any form of gov?

i can vibe with that.

except maybe a city? or does that roll too?

nah, he said, running a city is the ultimate grind – the toughest, highest stakes of 'em all.

so, that's the first major glitch of oligarchy, right?

clearly.

and here's another major flaw, just as sus:

what's the flaw?

the unavoidable split, man: this state ain't one, it's like two separate squads – one for the broke and one for the rich – both chillin' in the same hood and constantly scheming against each other.

no cap, that's at least as messed up.

another major bummer is that, for similar reasons, they're totally incapable of waging war. either they arm the mob and get more shook by their own peeps than the enemy, or if they keep the masses benched, then they're just an oligarchy with too few fighters to match their few rulers. plus, their mad love for cash makes them dodge taxes like it's an awkward question.

so cringe, right?

and as we already dropped, in this system the same peeps wear a million hats—farming, hustling, and soldiering all at once. does that even look fire?

no cap, that's a hot mess.

there's another massive evil, probably the worst of them all, that this state is doomed to right from the jump.

what's the evil, fam?

a guy might offload all his gear and someone else snags his stash; yet after selling, he remains stuck in the city – not as a merchant, craftsman, horseman, or soldier, but just a straight-up poor, helpless dude.

yup, that's the kind of evil that kicks off right here.

clearly, this evil doesn't get nipped in the bud, since oligarchies serve up both mega rich flex and complete pauper grind.

true.

but check it: back in his wealthy days, when he was droppin' mad cash, did this guy truly add legit value as a citizen for the state? or did he only appear to be part of the ruling squad, even though deep down he was just a junky spender?

exactly, he came off as a ruler, but in reality he was just a spendthrift.

aren't we just calling this dude the freeloader drone of the house, kinda like the buzzing drone in a honeycomb – where one is a curse to the city just as the drone is to the hive?

exactly, socrates.

and god's out here making flying drones, all stingless, while for the walking drones, some are stingless and others pack mad toxic stings; the stingless ones end up as paupers in old age, and the stingers turn into the whole criminal crew.

most true, he said.

so, whenever you peep paupers in any state, you can bet there are hidden-away scammers, pickpockets, temple robbers, and all kinds of lowlife troublemakers lurking around.

clearly.

so, i said, in oligarchical states, don't you always see paupers?

yes, he said; literally, anyone who isn't ruling is a pauper.

and can we be bold enough to say that these states also house a ton of criminals, rogues with stings, who the authorities are forced to rein in by brute force?

certainly, we can be so bold.

the presence of these clowns is totally due to a lack of proper education, bad training, and a shady state constitution, right?

true.

so, that's the structure and the evils of oligarchy; and trust, there are plenty more rotten issues lurking.

very likely.

so, oligarchy—the gov where the coin-rich are elected—can be dismissed. next, let's dive into the nature and origin of the person who vibes with this state.

by all means.

doesn't the timocratic man morph into the oligarch one like this?

how so?

eventually, a timocratic dude gets a son: at first, the kid copies his dad's moves, but then he sees his old man suddenly tanking against the state like he hit a reef, losing everything; maybe he was a general or a high-level boss who got dragged into a trial because of haters, and ended up either executed, exiled, or stripped of his citizen status while his assets got snatched.

nothing could be more on point.

so, having witnessed all that, the son is totally wrecked, and his fear teaches him to boot ambition and passion off his inner throne; humiliated by poverty, he jumps into hustling for cash, stacking up every penny through miserly saving and hard grind until he pulls together a fortune. ain't that prime for letting the mad craving for loot crown itself as the inner king, kitted out in a crown, chain, and scimitar?

most true, he replied.

and once he's got reason and spirit chilling obediently on each side of his inner boss, taught to stick to their lane, he forces one to only focus on flipping small coin into big stacks while not letting the other vibe with anything but cash and rich peeps, nor be hype about any goal other than amassing wealth and the means to grab it.

of all transitions, he said, there's no quicker or more guaranteed flip than turning that ambitious youth into a hardcore greedster.

and so, i said, the money-hungry one is basically the oligarchical youth, right?

yes, he said; basically, the og dude he evolved from is just like the state that birthed oligarchy.

let's peep if they're really on the same wavelength.

very good.

first, they both are all in on that coin-money grind.

certainly.

also, they got that scrappy, hustling vibe; the guy only satisfies his basic cravings and only drops coin on essentials, crushing all extra desires as unprofitable.

true.

he's a scruffy dude, always snagging a bit from everything to fatten his wallet; that's exactly the kind of guy that the normies hype up. isn't he the perfect image of the state he's representing?

he sure does; after all, money is a major flex for him, just like it is for the state.

you see, he's not the cultured type, i said.

i imagine not, he said; if he had any real education, he would've never crowned some clueless god as the boss of his crew or dished out top honors like that.

excellent, i said. but, for real, consider this: doesn't his lack of culture bring out those lowkey drone-level cravings, like those of paupers and rogues, which he only keeps down with his everyday grind?

true.

do you know where you'll have to peep if you wanna uncover his shady antics?

where must i look, fam?

you should scope him out when he's got a big chance to act sketchy – like when he's in charge of an orphan's guardianship.

aye.

it'll be clear af that in his regular hustle, which scores him a rep for being on the up and up, he keeps his sketchy desires in check not by schooling them with reason but by strict discipline and fear—'cause he's always shook about losing his stash.

to be sure.

yeah, for real, my dear friend, you'll notice those natural drone vibes are always lurking in him whenever he's droppin' cash that's not his own.

yes, and they'll be mad strong in him too.

so, the dude ends up at war with himself—like, he's two men in one; but generally, his better vibes come out on top over his weak ones.

true.

so because of that, he might seem more respectable than most, but the real vibe of a united, harmonious soul will be totally absent and never roll with him.

i'd expect that.

and surely, the miser is a cringe competitor for any glory prize or honorable hustle; he won't drop coin on the contest for fame, too shook of unleashing his pricey cravings to join the fight; oligarch-style, he only plays with a tiny slice of his dough, which usually means he misses out on the win while keeping his money safe.

very true.

can we even doubt that the miser-money-maker is the perfect rep for the oligarchical state?

there's zero doubt.

next, we got democracy; we haven't yet dived into its origin and vibe, and then we'll check out the ways of the democratic dude and call him out.

that, he said, is how we roll.

so, i said, how does the shift from oligarchy to democracy happen? isn't it that the state's main flex is to get as loaded as possible—an appetite that's never satisfied?

what then?

the rulers, knowing their power rides on their wealth, straight up refuse to legally curb the wild spending of the spendthrift youth because they profit off his ruin; they scoop up interest and buy up his estates, boosting their own wealth and rep.

to be sure.

there's zero doubt that mad love for cash and a chill moderation vibe can't roll together in one state's citizens—one is always gonna be left out.

that's pretty clear.

and in oligarch states, with all the careless excess, even the dudes from solid families end up reduced to beggars.

yes, often.

and yet, they're stuck in the city; there they are, armed and ready to sting—some owing mad coin, some stripped of citizenship; a whole third batch is caught in both traps; and they end up hating and scheming against those with property—and everyone else—buzzing for a full-on revolution.

that is true.

on the flip side, business peeps, stooping low and pretending not to see the wreckage they caused, slide their cash sting into some unsuspecting fool, and then scoop up their original sum, multiplying it into a legacy through a family—and so they churn out drones and paupers in the state.

yes, he said, there's plenty of them—that's for sure.

the evil ignites like a blazing fire; and they won’t put it out, neither by restricting a man's own property nor with any other fix:

what other solution?

the next best remedy, with the bonus of pushing citizens to check their own character: let there be a general law that everyone enters voluntary contracts at their own risk, and then the shady money-making and evils we mentioned will drop mad low in the state.

yes, they would be greatly slashed.

currently, the governors, fueled by these motives, treat their subjects poorly; and they and their squad, especially the young ruling class, are too used to a life of luxury and idleness—doing nothing and unable to fight back against pleasure or pain.

very true.

they're only out here to stack cash and couldn't care less about cultivating virtue, just like paupers.

yes, completely indifferent.

such is the state of affairs among them, fr. often the rulers and their squad cross paths—whether on a road trip, random meetup, pilgrimage, or even a march, vibing as fellow soldiers or fellow sailors; and yo, they might catch each other mid-drama when danger's lit—'cause where there's danger, the broke peeps ain't getting dissed by the rich flexers—and deadass, you might see that wiry, sunburnt poor dude getting strapped in battle right next to a rich homie who’s never even gotten roasted and is packing extra flesh—when he peeps this dude completely gasping and maxed out, how can he not peep that guys like him are rich only 'cause nobody's got the guts to snatch their swag? and when they kick it one-on-one, ain't folks gonna be throwing shade like, “our warriors ain't all that”?

yeah, he said, i'm totes aware that's literally how they chat.

and just like a sick body where even a tiny extra touch can mess things up, sometimes—no external tea even required—mad drama pops off from within. same vibe in any weak-ass state: even a slight trigger, with one squad throwing in their oligarch flex from the outside and the other sliding in their democrat crew, sends the state into a self-sabotaging brawl; sometimes it even goes off on a tangent with zero external inspo.

yes, for sure.

then democracy drops in on the scene when the broke squad straight up claps their haters—some get yeeted, others exiled—while the rest get an equal slice of freedom and power; and this is the type of government where the magistrates are basically picked by drawing straws, no cap.

yeah, he said, that's democracy's vibe—whether the revolution's gone full-on with the claps or the opposition bailed out straight-up out of fear.

so, yo, what's their daily drip and which kind of government they rockin'? 'cause the state shapes the dude.

obviously, he said.

first up, ain't they all just free af? ain't the city bursting with mad freedom and no-cap honesty—where a dude can spit and do whatever he wants?

yup, that's what they say, he replied.

and where there's freedom, a person can totally boss up their own life, right?

for sure.

so in that kind of state, we're gonna see the wildest mix of peeps, correct?

for sure.

so basically, this is likely the most lit state, like an embroidered drip-fit all spangled with every sort of flower. and just like women and kiddos are all about a variegated color palette, there are lots of dudes who see this state—with all the human vibes and quirks sprinkled on it—as the ultimate aesthetic, the fairest of them all.

yep.

yeah, my good sir, there's no better spot to scoop a government.

why tho?

'cause the liberty there is on fleek—they got a full assortment of constitutions, like different flavors on deck; and if you wanna build your own state, you gotta slide into a democracy like you're hitting up a bazaar, pick out the one that vibes with you, and then—bam!—found your own kingdom.

you can bet there's a whole squad of patterns to choose from.

and btw, i said, there's zero pressure for you to boss it up in this state, even if you're mad capable, or to be governed, unless it's your jam—like, you don't have to join the war squad when everyone else is fighting, or chill in peace when others are at ease—unless you're feelin' it. there's literally no rule saying you gotta hold office or be a decision-maker if you've got a fancy. isn't this lifestyle right now just hella awesome?

for now, yeah.

and ain't it mad cute how their vibes with the condemned sometimes come off as pretty charming? haven't you peeped how in a democracy, plenty of folks—even if they're sentenced to do the ultimate exit or exile—just chill where they are and cruise the world, with the dude strutting like a legit hero while nobody even bats an eye?

yeah, he replied, like a ton.

look, i said, democracy's all about that chill, forgiving vibe—so chill that she doesn't sweat the petty tea and straight-up ignores all our high-key ideals we set when we founded the city. remember when we said that, except for one of those rare gifted peeps, no good dude ever grows up without vibing with beauty and turning it into joy and a study? well, she tramples all that classy stuff under her kicks, never giving a thought to the pursuits that make a true statesman, and hyping up anyone who claims to be the people's ride-or-die.

yeah, she’s on that noble flex.

all these vibes and other similar quirks are totally democracy’s signature—a charming form of government that's wild with variety and chaotic as heck, handing out a kind of equality to both the boss level and the underdogs alike.

we stan her, fr.

now peep this, i said: what type of dude is the individual? or, looking at it like the state, how does he even come into being?

solid, he said.

isn't it that he’s basically the spawn of a cheap, oligarch dad who schooled him on his own shady habits?

exactly.

and, just like his old man, he lowkey keeps in check the spending vibes—those pleasures that are all about flashing cash instead of earning it—the ones we call unnecessary, ya dig?

obviously, bet.

for clarity’s sake, you wanna break down which pleasures are essential and which are just extra?

i’m down.

aren't necessary pleasures the ones you just can't ditch, with satisfaction that actually levels you up? they're called necessary 'cause nature built us to crave what’s beneficial and essential—no cap.

true that.

so it's totally legit to label 'em necessary, right?

we are, fr.

and those desires a dude can kick to the curb if he hustles from youth—cravings that bring zero vibe and sometimes straight-up wreck your flow—can we call all that extra stuff unnecessary?

yes, certainly, no cap.

suppose we pull an example of each, so we can really peep what they're about?

bet, that's lit.

isn't that hunger for basic grub and condiments—the ones needed for health and strength—a necessary flex?

that's exactly what i’d say.

the joy of munching is necessary twofold; it boosts our vibe and keeps the life train rolling.

yes, for sure.

but those condiments? they're only necessary if they're actually good for your health, right?

certainly.

and that extra flex for gourmet treats or other luxuries—stuff you could totally yeet if you trained yourself early on and that messes with your bod and kills your soul’s vibe for wisdom and virtue—is straight-up unnecessary.

very true, no cap.

can we say that those extra cravings just drain your coin, while the essential ones help you level up and produce real benefits?

certainly.

and for the love vibes and all the other pleasures, same deal, right?

true, no cap.

and that drone we mentioned? the dude who gets totally drowned in extra, unnecessary cravings—basically a slave to that extra hype—while the one who sticks to just the essentials stays all oligarch and tightwad.

very true, fr.

again, let's peep how a democratic dude emerges from that oligarch hustle—the process is kinda like a glow-up.

so what’s the process then?

when a young dude, raised in that basic and miserly style we just laid out, gets his first taste of drone’s honey and starts chilling with some savage, slick peeps who can hook him up with all sorts of refined pleasures, then—obviously—the oligarch vibes in him start flipping into full-on democratic mode.

inevitably, fr.

and just like in the city where like attracts like, with external alliances boosting one squad, the young dude gets switched up by a wave of outside cravings that hype up his inner vibes, kinda linking similar energies to boost one another.

certainty, bet.

and if any squad—like his dad or fam—adds fuel to his oligarch side, whether by hyping or throwing shade, then his soul splits into two crews that end up clashing hard.

yup, it has to be.

and sometimes the democratic vibe gives way to that oligarch flex—some of his cravings dip or even get booted out; then a vibe of mad respect slides into his soul and order is briefly restored.

yes, he said, that really happens sometimes.

and then, once the old cravings are yeeted, fresh ones pop up that are like mini-me versions, and since their OG doesn't know how to school them right, they go savage and multiply.

yes, he said, that's totally how it goes.

they pull him back to his old crew, getting all secret vibes with him, and boom—they multiply inside his persona.

very true, no cap.

eventually, they snatch up the citadel of his soul—a place that, sadly, is void of legit achievements, solid pursuits, and real talk that normally lives in the minds of peeps loved by the gods and who serve as their ultimate guardians.

no one better.

and fake flexes and clout-chasing catchphrases start stacking up to take over.

they're gonna do that, no doubt.

so the young dude ends up retreating to the lotus-eaters' zone, setting up camp right in front of everyone's eyes; and if his homies try sending support to his oligarch side, those same bogus vibes slam the gate of his kingly crib—blocking any official counsel or even private advice from the wise OGs. there's an all-out internal brawl, they clinch the victory, and then modesty—dubbed “silliness”—gets brutally exiled, while temperance—mocked as “unmanliness”—is trampled in the mud and tossed out; they hype it up that moderation and smart spending are just basic and lame, so with a rabble of shady appetites, they boot those principles beyond the border.

yep, for sure.

and once they've totally cleaned out the soul of the dude now under their control, initiating him into their wild mysteries, the next move is to flood his space with straight-up insolence, anarchy, waste, and raw impudence—flaring up in bright arrays with garlands on their heads and a massive squad chanting his praises and slinging sweet nicknames. they call insolence “breeding,” anarchy “liberty,” waste “magnificence,” and impudence “courage.” and so the young dude peaces out from his original, necessity-trained vibe and dives headfirst into the freedom and debauchery of useless, extra pleasures.

yes, he said, you can totally peep that transformation.

after that, he just keeps vibing—blowing his coin, energy, and time on extra pleasures just as much as on the essentials; but if he’s lucky and not too cray in his head, when years pass and the wild passion era fades—assuming he even invites back some exiled virtues into his life and doesn’t totally surrender to the next-gen vibes—then he manages to balance his pleasures and lives in a kind of equilibrium, handing over control of his life to whoever wins the first round; and when he's had his fill, he passes the reins to someone else—disrespecting none and hyping them all equally.

very true, he said.

and he won't take, nor let into his inner fortress, any legit advice; if anyone tries to school him that some pleasures are the satisfaction of noble, good vibes and others come from shady desires—and that he should cherish some while bossing the others around—every time it’s brought up, he just shakes his head and goes, “they're all the same; one is as dope as the next.”

yes, he said; that's just how he rolls.

yeah, i said, he lives day-to-day riding the vibe of the moment; sometimes he gets totally smashed, vibing on drink and flute jams; then he goes water-only to trim down; hops into a round of gymnastics; sometimes he just chills and ghosts all responsibilities, then flips back into full philosopher mode; often he’s deep in politics, suddenly jumping up to say and do whatever wild thought hits him; and if he starts flexing like a warrior, off he goes, or if it's business mode, he flips that switch too. his life is pure chaos—no rules, no order—and he calls that distracted hustle joy, bliss, and freedom; and so he just rolls on.

yes, he replied, he's all about that liberty and equality.

yes, i said; his life is mad motley and multifaceted—an epic snapshot of countless living styles. he's basically the living embodiment of that spangled, fair state we described. and tons of dudes and dudettes will see him as their role model, with a whole collection of constitutional flex and manners on deck.

just so.

so, set him against democracy and you got the prototypical democratic man.

let that be his vibe, he said.

lastly, we gotta talk about the most extra of all—for both the man and the state: tyranny and the tyrant; these are up next for consideration.

preach, he said.

so tell me, my friend, how does tyranny even pop off? it's clear that its roots are in democracy.

clearly.

and like, doesn't tyranny vibe off democracy just like democracy did off oligarchy—like, in a similar way?

how tho?

the tea is, the oligarchy was all about flexing mad wealth to keep power—am i right?

yes, no cap.

and that never-satisfied hustle for cash, while totally ghosting everything else, was straight-up the downfall of oligarchy, right?

true.

and democracy’s own vibe, that same endless thirst for more freedom, eventually brings her to the edge of collapse?

what vibe, though?

freedom, i replied; cuz in a democracy, freedom is the ultimate flex of the state—and that’s why only in a democracy does the free spirit truly wanna kick it.

yes; that’s the wave on everyone’s lips.

i was gonna point out that this unquenchable thirst and total neglect of everything else flips democracy on its head, setting up a real demand for tyranny.

how so, tho?

when a democracy, dying for freedom, ends up with sketchy cup-bearers running the party and guzzles too much of that strong freedom wine, then—unless the rulers are super chill and keep the draught coming—she straight up calls them out and punishes them, crowning them as cursed oligarchs.

yes, he replied, that's hella common.

yes, i said; and her loyal peeps get dissed by her own underlings—those clinging to their chains and those with zero clout—she wants subjects who flex like bosses and rulers who are just as chill as the everyday crew: these are the peeps she vibes with and praises both in private and on the streets. now, in a state like that, can liberty even have limits?

definitely not.

gradually, chaos sneaks into private cribs and eventually even spills over to the animals, infecting them with pure anarchy.

what do you mean, tho?

i mean the old dude starts chillin' at his kids' level and even gets shook by them, while the kid ends up on the same wavelength as his pops—with zero respect for either. that's his twisted version of freedom; even the metic is on equal ground with the citizen, and the stranger's just as dope as either.

yes, he said, that's literally how it goes.

and these ain't the only baddies, i said—there are a ton of smaller evils: in such a society, the boss fears and overly flatters his students, while the students straight-up diss their mentors and tutors; young and old basically merge into one vibe; the young are ready to throw down in words or deeds with the old, and the old, too busy being all chipper and jovial, end up mimicking the young's style instead of being morose or bossy.

quite true, he said.

the ultimate level of popular freedom shows up when a money-bought slave—male or female—is just as free as the buyer; and i gotta note the sick equality between the sexes when it comes to freedom.

why not, as aeschylus drops the word that just pops off our lips?

that's exactly what i'm doing, i replied; and i must add, no one clueless would believe just how mega the liberty is for the animals under human rule in a democracy versus any other state: truly, the she-dogs—as the old proverb goes—are as dope as their she-mistresses, and the horses and donkeys strut with all the rights and dignity of freemen; they'll straight-up yeet anyone blocking their path, and everything's practically about to burst with freedom.

when i take a country stroll, he said, i totally catch that vibe. it's like you and i share the same daydream.

and above all, i said, as the final sauce of all this, peep how extra sensitive the citizens become; they get hella triggered by even the smallest hint of authority, and eventually, as you know, they stop caring about laws—written or unwritten—and don't want anyone calling the shots over them.

yes, he said, i know that vibe all too well.

so, my friend, i said, that's the dope, epic kickoff from which tyranny actually sprouts.

glorious indeed, he said. but what's the next step, tho?

the downfall of oligarchy spells the downfall of democracy; it's like the same disease, blown up by too much freedom, that overtakes democracy—the truth is, when anything goes into overdrive, it eventually flips into its opposite. and that's true not just for the seasons or plants and animals, but especially for governments.

true, no doubt.

an overload of liberty—whether in states or in individuals—just ends up flipping into extreme slavery.

yes, that's the natural order.

so tyranny naturally emerges from democracy, and the most extra form of tyranny and slavery shows up when liberty is taken to the max?

just as you'd expect.

but that ain't what you really asked, right? you wanna know what disorder sprouts up in both oligarchy and democracy that ends up being their ultimate downfall.

just so, he replied.

well, i said, i'm talking about that squad of idle spendthrifts—the ones where the braver peeps end up leading while the more scaredy-cats follow—those very ones we compared to drones, some stingless and others packing a sting.

that's a super legit comparison.

these two cliques are like the plague on every city where they pop up, just like phlegm and bile in the body. and the top doc and lawgiver of the state should, like a savvy beekeeper, keep them at arm's length and, if possible, stop them from ever sneaking in; and if they've already crashed the party, he should slice 'em and their hives out as fast as possible.

yes, by all means, he said.

then, to keep it 100 and see our moves, let's imagine democracy chopped into three squads; cuz first up, freedom churns out way more drones in a democracy than in an oligarchy.

that's true, no cap.

and in a democracy, they're totally more extra.

how so, tho?

'cause in an oligarchy, those drones get disqualified and booted from power so they can't level up; whereas in a democracy, they're basically the ruling majority, and while the sharper peeps talk and act, the rest buzz around the bema, not allowing a single dissenting word on the flip side—so in democracies, almost everything is run by the drones.

very true, he said.

then there's another squad that's always getting split off from the main crew.

what's that, tho?

they’re the orderly squad, lowkey the richest ones in a trader hood.
obviously, no cap.

they’re the most get-squeezable peeps, oozing a swamp load of sweet honey for the drone crew.
why, he said, there’s barely any juice to squeeze outta folks who got nothing.

and that’s what we call the high-key wealthy crew—and the drones are out here milking them hard.
that's lowkey the tea, he said.

the people are like a third tier crew, the ones hustling with their own hands; they ain’t politicos and are mad broke sometimes. but when they roll together, they're the biggest, most extra power squad in a democracy.
true, he said; but yo, the mass squad ain't about vibing unless someone drops a bit of that honey.

and don't they share? i said. don't their top dogs swipe the rich’s estates and spill that drip among the crew, while always clutching the major chunk for themselves?
why, yup, he said, that's how the squad shares it out.

and those peeps who get jacked of their stash are forced to throw down a defense before the crowd, doing their best—what else can they do?

and then, even if they ain't tryna remix the vibes, the haters claim they’re plotting to mess with the peeps and are basically oligarchy homies.
facts.

and eventually, when the squad gets peeped—not by their own vibe, but 'cause they're fed up by shady tea from bogus informers trying to front a fast one—they're forced into the oligarch life; not by choice, but the sting of the drones is real and it triggers a wild revolt.
that's 100% the tea.

then come the wild impeachments, court dramas, and trial feuds.
facts.

the peeps always rally up a hype beast champion whom they crown and level up into greatness.
yep, that's how they do it.

this, and no cap, is the root from which a tyrant is born; when he first claps out his presence, he’s all about that protector vibe.
yeah, crystal clear.

so how does our protector morph into a full-on tyrant? duh—it happens when he starts pulling that wild move from the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus saga.
what saga, bro?

the scoop is: if one’s ever dipped into the entrails of one homie chopped up with others' guts, bro, he's on track to become a wolf. you never heard that tea?
oh, bet.

and our people-protector’s on the same path; with a whole mob ready to back him up, he don’t hesitate to off his own kin. using his fave move of bogus charges, he drags them to court and yeets them—making their lives vanish—while his twisted tongue savors his peeps’ blood. some he claps, others he banish-yeets, all while dropping hints about canceling debts and redividing property. and after all that madness, fate’s like: either get rekt by your enemies or flip from human to wolf, i.e., become a straight-up tyrant.
inevitable, no cap.

i said, that's the same dude who starts a crew against the rich.
same, bro.

after a hot minute, he gets kicked out, but then he boomerangs back—enemy be damned—as a fully grown tyrant.
clear af.

and if they can't kick him out or land a public death sentence on him, they end up conspiring to off him.
yup, he said, that's their typical move.

then up pops the legendary call for a bodyguard—a classic move in every tyrant’s playbook—"let not the people's friend," as they say, "be lost to them."
facts.

the people are totally cool with it; all their fear is for him—they ain't worried for themselves.
deadass.

and when a wealthy dude, tagged as a squad enemy, scopes this, then, my dude, just as the oracle dropped to croesus,
"by pebbly hermus’ shore, he bounces and never catches a break, with zero shame for being a total coward."
and he was like, "true that," 'cause if he were, he'd be forever drowning in shame.

but if he gets clapped, he dies—obviously.

and our once-protector peep is now the main overthrower, not just "larding the plain" with his bulk, but straight flexin' in the state chariot with reins in hand—ditching the protector vibe for pure, absolute tyrant energy.
no cap, he said.

and now, let's peep the happiness vibes of the man and the state that spawned a legend like him.
yeet, he said, let's vibe on that.

in the early glow-up of his power, he’s all smiles—saluting every soul he meets; this tyrant is droppin’ promises in both public streams and DM convos, freeing debtors, dishing out land to the peeps and his inner circle, and flexin’ mega kindness on everyone!
of course, no cap.

but once he’s yeeted out his foreign foes via war or chill treaties—once there’s zero threat—he always stirs up some fresh war drama just to keep the squad dependent on his leadership.
for real.

and isn't his other move to slam down mad taxes, leaving the squad broke and hustling just to survive, so they ain't got the clout to rebel?
obviously.

and if he even suspects someone of catching freedom vibes or resisting his rule, he’s got the perfect excuse to off ’em by handing them over to the enemy; hence, our tyrant is forever cookin’ up a war.
straight up, he must.

next, he starts losing major street cred—the inevitable clout drop.
then some of his ride-or-die crew, who helped crown him and still rock power, start throwin’ serious shade and droppin’ the real tea right into his grill.
obviously, expected vibes.

and if the tyrant’s tryna run the show, he’s got to off anyone—even a friend or an enemy—who’s still lit enough to stir some trouble.
no cap, he cannot.

therefore, he’s scanning the room for anyone bold, woke, wise, or loaded; dude, he’s automatically the enemy of all that fire energy and must find any chance to roast 'em until he cleans house.
yeah, he said, and it's a hardcore, rare purge.
i said, like, not that doctor-style cleanse where you boot the trash and keep the gems; nah, he flips it completely—kicking out the good and hoarding the toxic extras.
if he wanna rule, i suppose he’s doomed to that glitch, no cap.

what a blessed option, i said—to either be forced to chill only with a bunch of toxic lemmings and get hated for it, or, lowkey, not exist at all!
yep, that's the only option.

and as his cringey moves get more despised by the peeps, the more extra homies and loyal satellites he must snag, right?
definitely.

and who exactly are his devoted ride-or-die crew, and where's he gonna scoop 'em up?
he said, they'll roll up on him on the real if he’s droppin’ cash.
damn, i said, we're basically talkin' about a crazy swarm of drones from every nook and cranny.
yes, he said, they are.

but won't he wanna scoop 'em up right on the spot?
what do you mean, exactly?

he's gonna jack the citizens' slaves, set 'em free, and sign 'em up for his personal bodyguard squad.
for sure, he said; and he can trust those best, no cap.

what a lit creature, i said, this tyrant must be—offing the others and keeping these as his ultimate homies.
yes, he said; they're strictly his type.

i said, and these are the brand-new citizens he's conjured up—who stan him and roll with him, while the good ones are all about hating and ghosting him.
obviously.

for real, then, tragedy is some deep wisdom, and euripides was the ultimate tragedian.
why's that?
all 'cause he came through with that bomb quote,
"tyrants are wise by living with the wise;"
and he was clearly low-key saying that the wise ones picked as his homies legit make up his squad.
yes, he said, and he even hypes tyranny as god-tier; plus, plenty more similar vibes are dropped by him and other poet-homies.

and so, i said, those wise tragic poets will forgive us and any future squad if we don’t let 'em into our state—they're like the ultimate droppers of tyranny praise.
yes, he said, the brainy ones will def forgive us.

but they'll still roll into other cities, pulling in mob after mob, hiring voices that are loud and persuasive, and roping entire cities into both tyranny and democracy vibes.
so true.

moreover, they score mad cash and receive hella honors—the highest, as you'd expect, from tyrants and the next best from democracies; but the higher they climb our constitutional ladder, the more their rep fades, like they're gasping for air to go further.
facts.

but we're veering off, so let's bounce back and ask: how does the tyrant keep his lit, big, and constantly changing squad of soldiers?

if, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he'll snatch and splurge them; and if the fortunes of the downfallen can help, he'll slash the taxes he’d otherwise slam on the peeps.
and when those run out?
why, obviously, he said, then he and his crew—dude, whether they're dudes or chicks—will keep rollin’ using his dad’s stash.
so you mean the peeps who birthed him will end up supportin’ him and his homies?
yes, he said; they literally can't escape it.

but what if the squad flips and says that a grown son shouldn’t be bankrolled by his old man—but rather, the dad should be supported by the son? like, the father didn’t create him just to serve his own crew of scrubs; he raised him to guard him and help break free from that rich, aristocratic flex. so the old man kicks him and his posse out, just like any parent booting out a wild, unruly kid and his sketchy sidekicks.

by heaven, he said, then the old man will see the real monster he’s been cultivating; and when he tries to kick him out, he’ll find himself weak while the son’s rockin’ straight-up boss mode.
what, you don't seriously mean the tyrant's gonna throw hands against his own old man if he resists, right?
yes, he will—after disarming him, of course.

and then he’s basically a parricide—a straight-up savage to his own folks; and that’s where real tyranny lies, no question: as the saying goes, the peeps trying to dodge the smoke that is the slavery of freemen end up in the fire that is the tyranny of slaves. so, liberty, when it loses all order and logic, flips into the meanest, bitterest version of slavery.
true, he said.

alright then; can we say we've done enough dissection on the vibe of tyranny and the flip from democracy to tyranny?
yes, quite enough, he said.
