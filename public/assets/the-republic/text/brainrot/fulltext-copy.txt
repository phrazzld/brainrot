book i.

yo, so yesterday i dipped to the piraeus with glaucon, son of ariston, to throw up some prayers to the goddess (bendis, aka the thracian artemis, for real) and also to peep how they’d level up the new festival vibes. i was hype about the lit procession of the locals—even though the thracian squad’s parade was even more extra. once we wrapped up our sacred vibes and soaked in the visual drip, we turned toward the city; and then, outta nowhere, polemarchus—the son of cephalus—peeped us from afar as we were about to bounce home, and hollered to his sidekick to sprint over and say, “hang on, yo, polemarchus wants you to chill a bit.”

i spun around and asked, “where’s your boss at?”

the kid was like, “there he is, trailing behind—just chill and wait up.”

glaucon was like, “bet, we gotchu,” and a few mins later, polemarchus showed up with adeimantus (glaucon’s bro), niceratus (son of nicias), and a bunch of peeps from the procession.

polemarchus shot one at me: “socrates, i peep that you and your crew are already cruisin’ towards the city.”

i was like, “facts, you ain’t too off, my dude.”

but he clapped back, “yo, can you peep how many squad members there are?”

i was like, “ofc.”

then he asked, “are you strong enough to handle all these peeps? cuz if not, you’d have to stay put.”

i fired back, “can’t we just slide by and convince you to let us scoot?”

he snapped, “like, can you even hype us up if we ain’t vibing with your talk?”

glaucon piped in, “facts, definitely not.”

so, we’re not gonna listen to this, trust that.

adeimantus then added, “yo, haven’t you heard about the torch race on horseback in honor of the goddess that’s dropping tonight?”

i was like, “with horses?! fr, that’s wild. so these riders toss torches around mid-race?”

polemarchus confirmed, “yup, and not only that—but there’s a nighttime festival coming up that you gotta peep. after we grub, let’s bounce and soak in the festival vibes; there’ll be a crew of young blood for a dope chat. so, stick around and don’t be extra stubborn, aight?”

glaucon was like, “guess since you’re insistin’, we gotta roll with it.”

i hit back, “cool, cool, bet.”

so, we dipped with polemarchus to his crib, and there we bumped into his bros lysias and euthydemus, plus thrasymachus from chalcedon, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon (son of aristonymus). also, cephalus—polemarchus’ old man—was there, and damn, i hadn’t seen him in ages; he looked mad ancient. he was chilling on a cushy chair, rocking a garland on his head ‘cause he’d just been sacrificing in the court; a few other chairs were set up in a chill semicircle, and we scooted down next to him. he greeted me with mad hype, then dropped this:

“yo, socrates, you don’t hit up my pad as often as you should. if i could still roll up to see you on my own, i wouldn’t bug you to come here. but now, at my age, i can barely roll to the city, so you better slide into the piraeus more often. real talk: as my body’s pleasures fade, the charm and vibe of a good convo only get sweeter. so don’t ghost my invite—make my crib your go-to chill spot and kick it with these young homies; we’re old friends, and you’ll feel totally at home.”

i shot back, “cephalus, nothing beats kicking it with seasoned peeps—I see y’all as travelers on a journey i might someday be on, so i gotta ask: was the road smooth or mad rocky? basically, i wanna know if life’s a breezy cruise or an epic struggle.”

“alright, socrates,” he said, “lemme drop my two cents. peeps my age squad up together—birds of a feather, y’know—and when we vibe, the usual saga is: i can’t chow down, can’t sip right; all the lit perks of youth and romance are ghosted. back in the day, times were dope, but now it’s like, over. life just ain’t life anymore. some folks be whining about fam disses, blaming old age for all their probs. but for me, socrates, these whiners be blaming the wrong vibe. if old age was the real tea, then i and every old-timer would be on that same struggle. but that ain’t how i roll, nor have my homies. i still remember sophocles—the legendary old poet—when someone asked him, ‘yo, how does love vibe with age? still the same you?’ and he answered, ‘peace’—like, i’m stoked to have dodged that wild ride; i felt like i escaped from a raging, mad boss. his words still hit hard, as fresh now as back then. for real, old age brings major chill and freedom; when all that extra drama fades, as sophocles said, we’re freed from not just one crazy boss, but a whole squad. the truth, socrates, is that these moans and fam beef aren’t really caused by old age—they come from our own characters and temperaments. a peep with a calm, happy vibe barely feels the weight of age, but if you’re on the opposite trip, both youth and old age hit like a heavy burden.”

i sat there, super impressed and prodding him for more—so i said, “cephalus, i kinda suspect most peeps aren’t buying your vibe when you drop that wisdom; they figure your chill old age isn’t ‘cause you’re mellow, but ‘cause you got mad coin—and we all know cash is a killer comforter.”

“true dat,” cephalus replied, “they aren’t convinced—and there’s some truth in their clapbacks, just not as drastic as they think. i could drop one like themmistocles did to that seriphian hater who said i was only famous ‘cause i was an athenian: ‘if you were from my hood or i from yours, neither of us would be famous.’ same goes for those poor souls who gripe about old age; for a good poor dude, old age isn’t a lightweight, and a shady rich guy can never find real peace.”

so, i asked, “cephalus, can i ask: was your bag mostly inherited or did you hustle it out yourself?”

“acquired, for sure, socrates! ya dig? wanna know how much i raked in? in the money game, i’m right in the middle between my dad and granddad. my granddad—i even rock his name—doubled and trebled his stash (what he inherited is basically what i got now), but my dad, lysanias, kinda whittled it down to less than it is today. i’d be stoked if i can leave my sons not just what i got, but even a little extra over what i inherited.”

yo, that's exactly why i hit you with that question, i replied, cuz i peep that you're totally chill about cash – which, fr fr, is more typical of peeps who inherited their stacks rather than hustled for them; the money-makers are lowkey in a second-level crush with coin, like they stan their own bangers or how parents hype up their kids, on top of that natural love for cash for the flex and profit that all humans get. so, no cap, they're pretty much a one-track squad, only yapping about mad props for wealth.

facts, he said.

bet, that's so true, but can i hit you with another q? what's the absolute best blessing you copped from your coin stash?

one, he said, that i probably wouldn't have an easy time convincing others about. cuz listen up, socrates, when a dude thinks his time is almost up, all sorts of cray fears and dramas start poppin' off in his brain – stuff he never ever felt before; those ghost stories about a chill world below and the payback for our here-and-now moves used to be nothing but a lame meme, but now he’s straight up shook, wondering if they’re for real. whether it’s the whole aging vibe or just 'cause he’s cruisin’ closer to that next realm, he starts peepin' these things way clearer; suspicions and intense alarms flood his mind, and he starts reppin' over every bad move he dissed on others. and when he sees that his total screw-ups are mad high, he’ll, like a little kid, jump outta bed in the middle of sleep from fear, all drenched in dark, heavy vibes. but for a dude who feels zero guilt, sweet hope – as our boi pindar drops so charmingly – is like the ultimate hype nurse for his life's playlist:

  "hope cherishes the soul of a homie who lives straight up in justice and holiness, and is, like, the ride-or-die for his years and the squad on his journey; hope is the real mvp flex that can sway even the most restless soul of man."

omg, his words are straight-up fire! and check it, the dopest blessing of having mad stacks – and i'm not dissing any normie, but a legit good guy – is that he never had to go beast mode on anyone by schemin' or scamming them, whether on purpose or by accident; and when he taps out to the big beyond, he ain't stressin' about dropping offerings to the gods or owing any debt to the squad. like, that peace-of-mind vibe is majorly boosted by having cash, so, when you line up all the perks wealth can drop, for a wise homie, this is, in my honest opinion, the top flex.

facts, cephalus, i replied; but when we talk about justice, what’s the real tea? is it just keeping it 100 and paying up your debts—that’s it? and even that, aren’t there some twisty exceptions? like, say a homeboy, when he was solid, stashed his arms with me, and later, when he’s totally off his game, asks for them back—should i just straight up return them? nobody’s gonna hype that as the right move, any more than they'd say i should always be spewing truth to someone who’s way off their vibes.

facts, you're mad right, he replied.

but yo, i said, spitting truth and paying your debts ain't the full 411 on what justice really is.

true that, socrates, if simonides is what we’re vibin' with, chimed in polemarchus.

yo, i gotta bounce, said cephalus, 'cuz i gotta keep an eye on the sacrificial ritual vibes, so i'm droppin' the debate mic to polemarchus and the rest of the crew.

ain't polemarchus like your main successor? i asked.

aye, for sure, he answered, and dipped off laughing as he rolled toward the sacrifices.

spill the tea then, oh heir to this debate—what did simonides drop, and what do you honestly think he meant about justice?

he dropped that paying back your debts is just, and honestly, that vibe seems solid to me.

i’d be mad sorry to doubt the word of such a legendary, lit dude, but his drip, though probably crystal for you, is total static for me. cuz he definitely wasn’t saying that i should just hand back a stashed set of arms – or any other deposit – when someone’s off their game; yet a deposit is still, facts, a debt.

facts.

so when the homie who asks me is totally outta it, i'm not supposed to yeet the stash back, right?

definitely not.

so, when simonides said that payin' your debts was justice, he wasn’t including that off-the-rails case, right?

definitely not; cuz he’s all about that friend vibe – a real homeboy always does good for another homeboy and never goes out to roast them.

so, you're sayin' that if a friend gets back a deposit of gold that ends up hurting them, it ain't really payin' back the debt—that’s the vibe you'd expect him to drop?

yep.

and enemies, too, gotta get what we owe them?

for sure, he said, they should get what’s due; and like, an enemy, in my eyes, owes an enemy whatever is proper to them—in other words, bad juju.

so, simonides, channeling those poetic dark vibes, was basically saying that justice means giving each homie what’s rightful for them, and he called that a debt.

bet that's what he meant, he said.

no cap, i replied; and if we asked him what proper drop is given by medicine, and to whom, what do you reckon he'd say?

for sure, he’d say that medicine drops drugs, grub, and bevvies to human bodies.

and what proper drop does cookery deliver, and to who?

seasoning, bro – that’s the flavor for food.

so then, what does justice drop, and on who?

if, socrates, we vibe with the earlier analogies, then justice is that art that doles out good vibes to friends and low-key bad ones to enemies.

so, that’s his flex then?

i think so, fr.

and who’s best at boosting his squad’s vibes and dissing his haters even when they're down or sick?

the physician, obviously.

or, like, when they’re out cruising the wild seas, dodging all kinds of peril?

the pilot, no doubt.

but in which clutch moves, or aiming for what end, is the just dude most lit at dropping good on his friends and clapping back on his enemies?

by goin’ to war against one side and squad'ing up with the other.

but if a dude is all good and on point, my dear polemarchus, why would he need a physician?

nah.

and if you're not on a wild sea cruise, why call in a pilot?

nah.

so in chill, peace-out times, justice is basically just meh, right?

i’m way off that idea.

so you reckon justice can flex in both peace and battle?

facts.

like farming for that golden corn?

yep.

or like cobbling up fresh kicks for your drip—that what you're sayin'?

yep.

so, what similar clutch flex does justice have in peace mode?

in sealin’ the deal with contracts, socrates – justice is hella useful.

and by contracts, you mean those tight partnerships?

exactly.

but, between a righteous homie and a mad skilled draughts player, who would be the better squadmate in a game?

the skilled player, no cap.

and when it comes to stackin' bricks and stones, is the just dude a better partner than the builder?

nah, it's totally the other way around.

so in what kind of squad-up does the just dude outshine even a baller harpist—since when jammin' on a harp, the legit harp-player totally surpasses a guy who’s just about justice?

in a money collab, obviously.

yeah, polemarchus, but surely not in actual money moves; cuz you wouldn't want a justice nerd advising on buying or selling a horse—a dude who actually knows horses would come in clutch, right?

certainly.

and if you're tryna grab a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be the go-to?

true.

so, what’s that joint play with silver or gold where the just dude is actually the preferred partner?

when you need a deposit to be locked down safe.

you mean when money’s just chillin’, not actively in play?

precisely.

in other words, justice is clutch when your cash is just sitting useless.

that's the vibe.

and if you wanna keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice’s role is lit for both the individual and the state; but when it comes to actually usin' it, you gotta roll with the vine-dresser’s art, ya dig?

straight up.

and when you wanna stash a shield or a lyre rather than use 'em, then justice is the move; but if you're tryna flex 'em in action, then it's all about the soldier or the musician’s craft.

certainly.

so basically, for all these other things too—justice is useful when stuff is on chill mode, and kinda useless when that stuff is in full flex.

that's the takeaway.

so, justice ain't exactly a boss in practicality. but check this: isn't the dude who lands the sickest punch in a brawl or any fight the one best at blocking one back?

certainly.

and is the homie who's mad skilled at dodgin' or bouncing off a sickness also, like, the MVP when it comes to sparking one up?

for real.

and the ultimate camp guard is the one who can, like, stealthily outmaneuver the enemy?

certainly.

so basically, if you're dope at keepin' your stuff secure, you're also slick enough to jack it, right?

yup, that's the takeaway.

so, lowkey, if the just dude's lit at hoardin' cash, he's also, by that logic, mad skilled at snatching it.

that's exactly the inference.

so, turns out, the so-called just dude is, in the end, pretty much a thief. and this is a lesson i bet you picked up from homer; cuz he, when talkin' about autolycus – odysseus's maternal granddude and a total fav of his – drops that line:

  "he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury."

so, you, homer, and simonides are all vibin' that justice is just an artful hustle of thievery; meant, like, to be practiced "for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies"—is that what you were droppin'?

nah, certainly not that, even tho i can't exactly recall what i said before; but i'm still stickin' with that latter vibe.

but yo, here's another q: by "friends" and "enemies," are we talkin' about peeps who are, like, genuinely solid or just frontin' that vibe?

for sure, he said, you’d expect a dude to stan those he sees as good, and to roast those he pegs as trash.

true, but humans are lowkey confused about what's good and what's evil: a bunch of folks who ain't truly good might seem that way, and vice versa.

facts.

so then, might our squad accidentally end up callin' the good haters and the evil ride-or-die peeps?

true.

and then they'd be, like, droppin' good vibes on the baddies and dishing out bad juju to the good? obviously.

but the real ones, the good peeps, are straight-up just and wouldn't go out causin' harm.

true.

so, by your logic, is it justice to clap back on peeps who haven't done any wrong?

nah, socrates; that line of thought is straight-up immoral.

so, i guess we should be, like, boostin' the righteous and dissing the wicked, right?

i vibe with that, for real.

but peep the burn: plenty of dudes who don’t really get human nature end up with friends who are actually toxic – meaning they'd deserve a roast; and they might have enemies who are secretly gems, so they deserve props; but if that's the case, we'd be spittin' something totally opposite to the vibe simonides set.

big facts, he said: and i reckon we gotta fix this mix-up in how we're usin' "friend" and "enemy."

so, what's the glitch, polemarchus? i asked.

we kinda assumed that a friend is someone who appears or is thought to be good.

so, how do we remix this error?

we should say that a true friend is someone who is actually good as well as looks good; and if someone is only puttin' on a good face but ain't really good, then they ain't a friend at all; and the same goes for enemies.

so you're sayin' that the good are our ride-or-die crew and the bad are our haters?

yeah.

and instead of just sayin' that it's justice to do good for our friends and harm our enemies, we should drop it as: it's just to do good for our friends when they're actually good and to dis our enemies when they're truly evil.

yeah, that vibe sounds hella legit to me.

but should the righteous ever drop harmful blows on anyone at all?

no doubt, they should hit up only those who are both shady and their confirmed haters.

when a horse gets clapped, does it glow up or get wrecked?

definitely, it gets wrecked.

like, the horse loses its on-point qualities, not like a dog, right?

yep, of horses.

and dogs, too, lose their inherent doggo vibes when hurt, not horse vibes?

of course.

and won't humans who get injured lose that core human drip—the virtue that makes them who they are?

certainly.

and that core human drip is justice, right?

for sure.

then, if dudes get hurt, they're, like, inevitably made less just?

that's the take.

but can a musician, just by droppin' beats, make folks lose their musical vibe?

def not.

or can a rider, just by flexin' his craft, turn someone into a bad horseman?

impossible.

and can a righteous dude, by simply being righteous, flip someone into injustice—or more generally, can pure good vibes turn a person bad?

absolutely not.

any more than heat can just spawn cold, right?

it totally cannot.

or like, trigger moisture during a drought?

clearly not.

nor can the good ever truly harm anyone.

impossible.

and the just is basically the good, right?

for sure.

so droppin' harm on a friend or anyone else isn’t the move of a just dude—it’s what the unjust do.

i feel that up to the highest degree, socrates.

so if a dude claims that justice is merely payback on debts, and that good is the debt a just dude owes his friends while evil is what he owes his haters—droppin' that ain't smart; cuz, as we've shown, harming someone is never just, no matter how u spin it.

i agree with you, said polemarchus.

so, you and i are ready to throw down on anyone who tries to flex that line from simonides, bias, pittacus, or any of those so-called wise OGs or prophets?

i'm hella ready to squad up and battle on your side, he said.

should i spill whose vibe i think actually started that line?

who, tho?

i reckon that either periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban, or some other mega-rich, flexin' dude with crazy self-love, was the first to drop that justice line: "doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies."

preach, he said.

yep, i said; but if this justice definition also gets wrecked, what alternative roll-up can we serve?

in the heat of the debate, thrasymachus tried several times to hijack the convo for his own drip, but the squad shut him down, dying to hear the finale. but once polemarchus and i were done spitting and things went quiet, he totally lost his chill; gathering all his wild beast energy, he charged at us like a savage tryna snatch us up. we were, like, totally shook, panic-mode activated.

he bellowed to the whole crew: "what crazy biz, socrates, has gotten into you all? and why, you damn goofy peeps, are you brawling among yourselves? i mean, if you truly wanna know what justice is, you shouldn’t just ask—you gotta drop your own answer too, and stop chasing clout by solely tearing off an opponent's argument; there are mad peeps who can ask without being able to answer. and i ain't down for you saying justice is just duty, profit, gain, or interest, cuz that weak sauce won't fly with me—I need clarity and real talk."

i was legit terrified by his rant, shaking so hard i could barely peep him without trembling. honestly, i swear if i hadn’t fixed my eyes on him, i would've been totally struck dumb; but once i saw his fury rising, i braced up and managed to hit him back.

thrasymachus, i stuttered, please don’t roast us too hard. polemarchus and i might've slipped up a bit in our debate, but trust that it wasn’t on purpose. like, if we were out there hunting for gold, you wouldn’t think we were trippin’ over one another and blowing our chance to snag it. so why, when chasing justice – which is way more precious than piles of gold – do you say we're weakly yielding to each other instead of going all out for the truth? no, my dude, we’re hella willing and hyped to get it, but sometimes the vibe just escapes us. so, if that’s the case, you wise peeps should cut us some slack instead of getting mad.

classic socrates, he shot back with a bitter chuckle; "yo, that's just your ironic flex! did i not call it out—did i not warn you that whoever is asked something will always dodge the real answer by using irony or some other shuffle to avoid actually answering?"

you're a philosopher, thrasymachus, i replied, and you know if you ask someone what combo of numbers makes twelve—and you strictly ban them from answering "two times six," "three times four," "six times two," or "four times three," because you say, 'this kind of nonsense won’t cut it for me'—then obviously, if that's your way of setting the question, no one can nail an answer. but imagine if they shot back, "thrasymachus, what do you mean? if one of these banned answers is actually the correct flex, am i screwed for dropping another number that's off?—is that what you're sayin'?"—what would your comeback be?

like, as if these two scenarios were even in the same league! he replied.

why not? i asked; and even if they're not truly identical, but just seem that way to the one gettin' asked, shouldn't he just spit his own thoughts regardless of whether you and i try to shut him down?

so, i guess you're gonna drop one of those banned answers?

i dare say i might – even if it's risky – if, after some deep thought, one of them vibes with me.

but what if i hit you with a justice answer that's next-level and better than any of those? he said, then what do you reckon you deserve to have done to you?

done to me! – like, as any clueless dude should learn from a wise one—that's the vibe i reckon i deserve.

what, and like, no cash out? that's an epic notion!

i'll pay when my wallet's flush, i replied.

but dude, you, socrates, as glaucon already said—and you, thrasymachus, shouldn't sweat cash either, cuz we're all gonna chip in for socrates.

yep, he replied, and then socrates will do his usual move—refusing to drop a straight answer himself, but going all out to tear apart someone else's answer.

bro, i said, how can anyone who claims to know stuff, and even if they've got some hazy ideas, be shut down by a so-called authority from spittin' them? naturally, the speaker should be someone like you who not only claims to know but can actually spill the tea. so, please, enlighten the squad and me, fam.

glaucon and the rest of the crew jumped in on my ask, and thrasymachus, as anyone could see, was lowkey hyped to speak – he thought his answer was fire and would let him shine. but at first, he played it off insisting i should answer; eventually, he relented and started. "check it," he said, "the genius of socrates: he doesn't school himself, but goes around learning from others—without even dropping a 'thank you.'"

i replied, "yeah, it's true i learn from others; but saying i'm ungrateful? that's straight-up bogus. i got zero cash, so i pay in praise, which is honestly all i've got; and trust, i'm always ready to hype anyone who spits real fire—you'll see when you answer, cuz i expect you to slam a killer response."

listen up, then, he declared; "i proclaim that justice is nothing but the interest of the stronger. so now, why don't you give me props? but of course, you won't."

"let me break it down," i replied. "justice, as you say, is the interest of the stronger. so, thrasymachus, what exactly do you mean by that? you ain't tryin' to say that, just because polydamas—the ultimate pancratiast—is stronger than us and finds beef perfect for boosting his strength, that eating beef is automatically good for us weaklings and, like, totally just for us, right?"

that's straight-up trash, socrates; you’re twisting words in the most damaging way for the argument.

not at all, my good sir, i said; i'm just tryna get your drift and wish you'd drop some clearer deets.

"well," he said, "haven't you peeped that there are diff types of government out there; like, tyrannies, democracies, and aristocracies?"

yup, i know.

and, like, the government is the main ruling force in each state, right?

for sure.

and yo, check it: different types of gov – whether they’re democratic, aristocratic, or straight-up tyrannical – drop laws that are all about boosting their own clout; these laws, crafted just to hype up their own agenda, are the “justice” they serve to their squad, and anyone who steps outta line gets yeeted as a lawbreaker and called totally unjust. that's what i mean when i say that in every state, the vibe of justice is the same – it’s all just the gov’s own hustle; and since the gov’s gotta be all about that power, the only logical flex is that everywhere, justice is really just the interest of the stronger. no cap.

aight, i got you, i said; and whether you’re on point or not, i'm gonna dive in. but gotta drop this tea: in your definition of justice, you peeped the word “interest” – even though you told me not to drop it – except you sneaked in “of the stronger” on top.

a small add-on, you gotta admit, he said.

big or small, who cares – first, we gotta see if what you're saying is the real tea. now we both vibe that justice is some kinda interest, but then you add “of the stronger”; and honestly, i'm not 100 on that extra drop, so i gotta look a lil deeper.

proceed.

i will; first off, tell me—do you vibe that it’s legit for subjects to obey their rulers?

i do.

but check it: are state rulers totally flawless, or do they sometimes mess up?

for real, he replied, they def slip up.

so when they craft their laws, sometimes they nail it, and sometimes they totally clown?

true.

when they’re on point, their laws vibe with their own interests; but when they’re off, they end up with laws that go against their own hustle—you feel me?

yes.

and these laws have to be followed by their peeps—and that's what you call justice?

no cap.

so then, by your logic, justice isn’t just about the subjects riding the wave for the stronger’s gains, but also, like, the flip side?

what are you even sayin? he asked.

i'm just rehashing your own words, i believe. but check this: haven’t we already agreed that rulers can be off on what they think their own interest is when they drop orders, and yet obeying them is still called justice? that was already a given, right?

yes.

then you gotta admit that justice isn’t really about serving the stronger’s interest when rulers accidentally order stuff that actually hurts them. cuz if, as you say, justice is just the subjects doing what they're told, then oh wisest of men, can we dodge the truth that the weak end up forced to do not what benefits the stronger, but what harms the stronger?

nothing’s clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.

yeah, said cleitophon, jumping in, if you want me as witness.

but no cap, no witness needed, said polemarchus, 'cause thrasymachus already admitted that rulers sometimes drop orders that don't even boost their own game, and yet following them is still called justice.

yeah, polemarchus—thrasymachus said that subjects doing what their rulers dictate is justice.

yeah, cleitophon, but he also slid that justice equals the stronger’s interest, and while confessing both moves, he also admitted that the stronger might order the weaker to do stuff that isn’t even in his favor; hence, justice ends up being about the injury just as much as it’s about the gains for the stronger.

but, cleitophon said, what he meant by the stronger’s “interest” was just what the stronger thought was his own flex—that’s what the weak had to handle; and he crowned that as justice.

that’s not exactly what he said, shot back polemarchus.

nm, i replied, if he’s now saying that, let’s just roll with it. tell me, thrasymachus, did you really mean by justice what the stronger thinks is his interest, whether that’s on point or just a cap?

certainly not, he said. do you really think that i call a dude who’s off his game “the stronger” just 'cause he’s mistaken?

yep, i said, i got the vibe that you did that when you admitted that rulers aren’t infallible and can totally mess up.

you be arguing like a snitch, socrates. are you saying, for example, that a doc who misdiagnoses isn’t really a doc while he’s tripping? or that someone who flops in math or grammar is still tagged as a math whiz or wordsmith at the time of the goof, with the mistake just being a slip? true, we say that the doc or the math whiz made a mistake, but that’s just how we chat; the real tea is that no legit grammarian or expert ever messes up while they’re truly dope at what they do—they only slip when their game is off, and then they ain’t that skilled no more. no true artist, sage, or ruler slips up while they’re fully in their role; even if folks be saying they do, that's just common talk. but for the sake of mad accuracy—since you’re all about that detail—we should say that a ruler, as long as he’s in ruler mode, is unerring, and being unerring, always drops commands that serve his own clout; and his subjects are obliged to follow. so, like i said from the jump, justice is the interest of the stronger.

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i seriously come off as that snitch, huh?

certainly, he replied.

and you think i'm tossing these questions just to roast you in this debate?

nah, he replied, ‘suppose’ isn’t the right word—I know it; but you’re gonna get clapped, and with just your arguments, you’ll never come out on top.

i ain't tryna go there, my dear man; but to keep it 100 for the future, lemme ask: when you talk about a ruler or the stronger—whose interest, as you dropped, is so thought to be their own flex that the weaker must follow—is that a ruler in the everyday, popular sense or in the strictly legit sense?

in the strictest sense possible, he said. and now, go ahead and play that snitch game if you wanna; i’m not asking for mercy. but trust, you’ll never ever pull it off.

and you really think, i said, that i'm such a lunatic as to try and hustle a cheat, thrasymachus? that’d be like trying to shave a lion, fr fr.

why, he said, you already tried it like a minute ago and flopped.

alright, enough of this pleasantry, i said. let’s cut to the chase: is the true physician—a real one in that strict sense—a healer of the sick or just a coin-chaser?

a healer of the sick, he replied.

and what about the pilot—that is, the real pilot—is he the captain of his sailors or just riding shotgun as a regular sailor?

a captain of sailors.

the fact that he’s on the ship doesn’t count; he’s not just a sailor. the title “pilot” is all about his mad skills and his boss-level authority over the crew.

facts, he said.

now, i said, every art has its own vibe or interest, right?

certainly.

for which it’s gotta scope out and deliver?

yes, that’s the whole aim of art.

and the point of any art is to be perfect—nothing more, nothing less?

what do you mean?

i mean, peep this negative example using the body. if you asked me whether the body can handle itself or if it’s got needs, i’d say: for sure, the body has needs; it can get sick and need fixing, and that’s exactly why the art of medicine is in the game—it’s there to serve the body’s interests, as you'd agree. right?

quite right, he replied.

but then, is the art of medicine—or any art for that matter—guilty of being buggy or missing something, like how an eye might not see well or an ear might not catch sound, and therefore need another art to step in? in other words, is any art prone to glitches that require extra fixes over and over, or do arts only worry about their own subject’s vibe? or are they straight-up flawless, with no need for any extra patch-up, since they’re perfect as long as they stick to what they’re about? using your super precise terms, tell me—am i right?

yes, clearly.

then medicine isn’t looking out for its own bag, but for the body’s vibe, right?

true, he said.

and same with, say, horsemanship—it’s not about the art itself but about what’s best for the horse; no art cares for itself 'cause they got no needs—they only serve what their subject requires.

true, he said.

but surely, thrasymachus, aren’t the arts like total bosses over their own subjects?

he agreed, but with a serious hint of hesitation.

then, i said, no science or art is out here hyping up the stronger's own gains; they’re only about boosting the subject’s vibe, the weaker ones.

he tried to argue back a bit, but eventually chilled and agreed.

then, i continued, no real physician, while in doc mode, is out here thinking about his own profit when prescribing—they’re all about the patient’s good; after all, the true doc is like a ruler with the human body as his domain, not some coin-flipping hustle; we’re on the same page, yeah?

yes.

and the pilot too, in the strict sense, is the boss of the sailors—not just another sailor on deck?

that was agreed.

and such a pilot, as the ruler, dishes out orders that serve the sailors’ vibe, not his own or the boss’s profit?

he muttered a reluctant “yes.”

then, i said, thrasymachus, no ruler—while in full ruler mode—cares about boosting his own bag; he’s always laser-focused on what’s best for his subjects or what works for his art. that’s the only thing he ever considers in all his moves.

at this point in the debate, when everyone peeped that the whole definition of justice was totally flipped on its head, thrasymachus, instead of clapping back, hit me with: “tell me, socrates, you got a nurse?”

why you droppin’ that question, i said, when you should be spitting your own bars?

'cause she lets you snivel and never even wipes your nose—she didn’t even school you on who’s the real shepherd and who’s just a sheep.

what makes you say that? i replied.

'cause you’re tripping thinking that a shepherd fattens up his sheep or oxen for their own good—like he’s at some fancy dinner or chowing down at a banquet, or even hustling as a trader on the market—instead of actually looking out for his own boss vibes; and you even imagine that true state rulers never see their subjects as sheep, always scheming for their own gain day and night. nah fam; you’re so off-base about what’s just and unjust that you don’t even realize justice and the just are really all about someone else’s gain—that is, the ruler’s interest and the loss for the subject, while injustice is the flip side. the unjust boss gets all the clout over the genuinely simple and just crew: he’s the stronger, and his subjects do what perks up his hustle and serve his happiness, which is mad far from being their own. think on it, most foolish socrates—the just always end up taking an L compared to the unjust. first, in private deals: whenever a just person teams up with an unjust one, when the partnership breaks, the unjust dude always walks away with more, and the just gets played. second, when dealing with the state: with income tax, the just pays way more and the unjust way less on the same stack; and when there’s any loot to be had, the unjust pockets big while the just comes up empty. also peep what happens when they step into office: the just man ends up neglecting his own grind, maybe suffers extra losses, and gets zilch from the public ‘cause he’s too busy being honest; plus, his mates roast him for refusing to serve them through shady means. but flip that script for the unjust man. i’m talking big-scale injustice here where the upside for the unjust is crystal clear; and it hits hardest when we peep the highest form of injustice—where the criminal is living his best life and the ones who stick to being just end up totally miserable—that’s tyranny, where by straight-up fraud and force, he rakes off everyone else’s property, not little by little but on the down-low wholesale; scooping up the sacred with the profane, the private with the public; for if he got caught doing any one of these moves solo, he’d get smashed with punishment and mad disgrace—those solo wrongdoers get tagged as temple robbers, man-stealers, burglars, swindlers, and thieves. but when a dude goes all out—snatching cash and even turning citizens into slaves—then instead of getting roasted with those names, he’s hailed as happy and blessed by not only his own people but by everyone who hears he maximized injustice. 'cause people call out injustice not just ‘cause they’re too woke to do it themselves, but ‘cause they’re scared they might get hit next. so, as i’ve been droppin, socrates, when injustice runs on a big scale, it’s got mad strength, freedom, and control compared to justice; and like i said from the start, justice is just the interest of the stronger, while injustice is all about a man’s own profit and hustle.

after dropping that massive bath-man flow, thrasymachus was lowkey about to dip. but the squad wasn’t having it—they insisted he stay and defend his stance; and i even threw in my humble ask for him to stick around. “yo, thrasymachus,” i said, “your points are hella suggestive! you really gonna bounce before schooling us on whether they’re legit or not? is figuring out how we all level up in life such a minor side hustle for you?”

and do i seem any different from you on how important this deep dive is? he said.

you honestly seem like you couldn’t give a damn about us, thrasymachus—whether we live better or worse ‘cause of not knowing what you claim to know is all just blah to you. come on, friend, don’t keep your wisdom locked up; we’re a whole squad, and any glow-up you drop on us will get mad props. as for me, i’m out here saying i’m not convinced, and i don’t think injustice is more profitable than justice—even if you let it run wild. even if there’s some unjust dude out here pulling shady moves by fraud or brute force, that still doesn’t convince me that injustice is the superior flex, and maybe others are feeling the same. maybe we’re off; if that’s the tea, drop your wisdom and show us we’re wrong about preferring justice over injustice.

and how am i supposed to convince you, he said, if you’re not already shook by what i just dropped? what else can i do? you want me to implant the proof straight into your soul?

heaven forbid! i said; i’m just asking you to keep it consistent—if you switch up, do it out in the open, no shady vibes. i gotta note, thrasymachus, if you remember what you dropped earlier: even though you started by defining the true physician in a super exact way, you totally lost that precision when talking about the shepherd; you were trippin’ thinking that a shepherd, in his role, tends the sheep not for their own good but like he’s feasting at a banquet or hustling as a market trader, instead of being a real shepherd. but for real, the art of the shepherd is only about the good of his crew; he just has to serve the best for them, since an art is already on lock once all its boxes are ticked. and that’s what i was saying about the ruler too. i figured the art of ruling—whether in a state or in private life—should only be about the good of his flock, while you seem to think that state rulers—the true bosses—are all about flexing their own authority.

think! nah, i’m mad sure of it.

then why is it that for lesser gigs, no one’s tryna take ’em without getting paid, unless they believe they're governing for the squad’s gain and not just for themselves? lemme ask: aren’t the different arts, by nature, all about their own separate functions? and, my illustrious friend, spit your truth so we can actually make some progress.

yes, that’s the diff, he replied.

and each art drops its own special perk and not just a general vibe—medicine, for instance, gives you health; navigation gives you safe waves at sea, and so on?

yes, he said.

and the art of payment has the unique job of dishing out cash—but don’t get it twisted with other arts, just like the art of the pilot isn’t the same as the art of medicine, even if a sea trip might boost a pilot’s health. you wouldn’t say that navigation equals medicine, right, if we gotta stick to your exact words?

certainly not.

nor would you say that because a dude's vibing in good health after getting paid, that the art of payment is medicine?

i wouldn’t.

and you feel that the benefit of each art is locked to that art alone?

yes.

then, if there’s any perk all artists share, it’s gotta come from something they all use in common?

true, he replied.

and when an artist benefits by getting paid, that extra boost comes from the separate art of payment, which isn’t actually his main craft?

he grumbled a reluctant “yes.”

so, the cash flow isn’t derived directly from each artist’s own art. the real tea is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of building drops a crib, there’s always that extra art of pay in the mix. each art does its own thing and boosts its own subject, but would an artist even gain any clout from his craft unless he also got paid?

i suppose not.

but does that mean he drops zero benefit when he works for free?

definitely, he still drops benefits.

now, thrasymachus, there’s zero doubt: neither arts nor governments are in it for their own bag; as we were saying, they rule and boost the interests of their subjects—the weaker ones, not the strong—catering to their good, not that of the superior. and that, my dear thrasymachus, is why, like i was just saying, no one’s hyped to govern; cuz no one wants to fix problems that aren’t even their own drama without getting some form of payment. when a true artist’s out here doing his work and dishing orders, he never weighs his own hustle—he’s all about what’s best for his subjects; so for rulers to be down to rule, they gotta get paid in one of three ways: cash money, mad honor, or even a penalty for frontin’.

yo, what you tryna say, socrates? said glaucon. the first two ways of gettin’ paid are hella clear, but the penalty part? i’m straight-up lost on how a penalty can even count as cash.

dude, you seriously ain’t gettin’ that this “payment” – the ultimate flex for the real ones to rule – is the big motivator? obviously, you know that chasin’ clout and mad greed are seen as total cringe, no cap.

facts.

and for that reason, i said, money and honor ain’t on their vibe; the real ones don’t wanna be out here openly demanding fees for runnin’ things and gettin’ tagged as mere hirelings, nor do they wanna sneakily dip into the public loot and get labeled as thieves. since they’re not extra about the cash grind, honor just isn’t their jam. so, necessity has gotta be slapped on 'em, and they’re forced into servin’ outta straight-up fear of punishment. i guess that’s why steppin’ up to take office on your own terms—rather than waitin’ to get pushed in—gets called dishonorable.

and the worst part? if you bounce on rulership, you might end up bein’ ruled by someone even wackier than you. that fear, i reckon, forces the good ones to grab the reins—not 'cause they’re hyped for perks, but simply because they can’t pass the buck to someone better (or even as good as themselves). there’s real talk in thinkin’ that if a city were built entirely of solid peeps, dodgin’ office would be just as much a hot mess as snaggin’ it now; that’d straight-up prove that the true boss isn’t meant to chase personal gain but has to look out for the squad. anyone in the know would rather pocket a benefit from someone else than waste time dishin’ one out themselves.

i’m nowhere near vibin’ with thrasymachus’ idea that justice is just the interest of the strong. now, this later question doesn’t need much more deep-divin’ for now; but when thrasymachus drops that the crooked life is more lit than the just life, that new claim hits way harder. so, which of us is spillin’ the truth? and, glaucon, which life you dig more?

i, for my part, think that livin’ just is hella more advantageous, he answered.

yo, did you catch all the extra perks thrasymachus was spittin’ about for the crooked path?

yeah, i heard his spiel, he replied – but honestly, it didn’t flex enough to convince me.

then, shall we try to show him that his claims are straight-up bogus?

most certainly, he replied.

if, i said, he drops a fixed speech and we hit back with our own lit rundown of the advantages of bein’ just, and he answers and we counter-rap, then we’d just be countin’ and comparin’ the perks on both sides – eventually needin’ a squad of judges to decide; but if we keep our convo real, swapping admissions like we did before, we’d basically merge the roles of judge and lawyer in our own crew.

big mood, he said.

and which method you feel is best? i asked.

the one you just proposed.

aight, then, thrasymachus, i said, let’s rewind to the start: you claim that flawless injustice is way more gainful than flawless justice?

yup, that’s my vibe, and i’ve already dropped my reasons.

so, do you peep one as straight-up virtue and the other as pure vice?

certainly.

so, you’re sayin’ justice equals virtue and injustice equals vice?

what a cute idea! especially since i’m reppin’ injustice as profitable while justice comes off as meh.

what else you got then?

the opposite, he replied.

and would you tag justice as vice?

nah, i’d say it’s pure, sublime simplicity.

so then, would you call injustice malignity?

nah – i’d label it all about discretion.

but yo, do you peep that the crooked peeps come off as wise and dope?

yeah, he said; at least the ones who can nail perfect injustice and have the muscle to boss around states and nations – though maybe you think i’m just talkin’ about lowkey cutpurses. even that shady hustle, if it flies under the radar, has some perks, though they can’t really compare to the ones i just mentioned.

i ain’t tryna diss your meaning, thrasymachus, i replied; but fr, i’m shook that you’re mixin’ injustice with wisdom and virtue, and callin’ justice the total opposite.

yup, i definitely do that.

so, i said, you’re standin’ on some deep, almost unanswerable ground; like, if the injustice you’ve been hypin’ as profitable was also admitted (by you and others) to be straight-up vice and ugliness, then we could’ve shot back with classic principles. but now, i see you’re callin’ injustice honorable and strong, and you’re slappin’ all the same qualities on the crooked that we used to drop on the just – you don’t even blink when you pair injustice with wisdom and virtue.

you read my mind, he replied.

then i certainly won’t back down from this debate as long as i’m feelin’ you, thrasymachus, keepin’ it 100; i totally believe you’re now all in and not just clownin’ at our expense.

i might be dead serious or not, but that’s on you—to shut down the argument is your gig.

facts, i said; that’s my job. but can you answer one more thing? does a just dude try to score extra over another just dude?

nah, on the flip—if he did, he wouldn’t be that chill, low-key vibe creature he is.

and would he ever try to level up past just doin’ what’s right?

he wouldn’t.

so, if he tried to one-up the crooked, would he see it as just or totally off?

he’d think it’s on the up-and-up and try to grab that edge; but he just wouldn’t be able to pull it off.

whether he can or can’t is beside the point, i said; the real tea is whether a just dude, while not tryna outdo another just dude, still wants and claims to have more than the crooked ones?

yep, he would.

and what about the crooked—do they try to score more than the just and do things that aren’t on the level?

of course, he said, ‘cause they’re all about flexin’ to have more than everybody else.

true.

so, rephrase it like this, i said—the just dude only wants more than his non-just crew, not more than his equals, whereas the crooked ones aim to snag more than both their own squad and the outsiders.

nothing, he said, can top that level.

and does that mean the crooked are smart and dope while the just aren’t?

good, he said.

and isn’t it that the crooked are on the same wavelength as the wise and dope, while the just are totally not part of that club?

obviously, he said – if you’re built with that real vibe, you’re just like others who are too; if not, you ain’t.

so, i said, every person is basically what their crew is, right?

certainly, he replied.

solid, thrasymachus, i said; now switch it up to the arts: you cool with sayin’ one dude can be a musician while another isn’t?

yeah.

so, which one’s baller and which one’s basic?

obviously, the musician’s the smart one, and the non-musician comes off as clueless.

and he’s good when he’s on point, and bad when he’s off?

yup.

and you’d drop the same for a physician?

yeah.

and tell me, my excellent friend, do you think a musician, when fine-tunin’ his lyre, would ever try to flex by outperformin’ another musician at adjusting the strings?

i don’t think so.

but he’d definitely wanna outshine a non-musician, right?

of course.

and what about a physician? when handin’ out meats and drinks, would he try to one-up another physician or even the whole med game?

he wouldn’t.

but he’d for sure wanna outdo someone who isn’t a doctor?

yes.

and when it comes to knowledge versus ignorance in general, would any brainiac ever wanna flex by sayin’ or doin’ more than another brainiac? wouldn’t he rather just keep it on the same level as his fellow smart peeps?

that, i suppose, is pretty obvious.

and what about the clueless ones? wouldn’t they be all about havin’ more than both the smart and the clueless?

i dare say.

and the knowledgeable are wise, right?

yes.

and the wise are good?

true.

so, the wise and dope dudes wouldn’t try to snag more than their own crew, but only more than those outside it?

i guess so.

while the trash and clueless ones wanna grab more than everyone else?

yes.

but didn’t we say, thrasymachus, that the crooked go beyond both their own squad and the outsiders? wasn’t that your own drip?

they were.

and you also dropped that the just won’t go beyond their own crew but only target the outsiders?

yes.

so, that means the just are like the wise and dope, and the crooked like the evil and clueless?

that’s the takeaway.

and each person is exactly what their crew is?

that’s a given.

so, in the end, the just come off as wise and dope, and the crooked as evil and clueless.

thrasymachus admitted all this – not in a smooth flow like i just recapped, but with major reluctance; it was a scorchin’ summer day, and sweat was drip-droppin’ off him in torrents; and then i peeped something i’d never seen before – thrasymachus straight-up blushed.

since we were now on the same page that justice equals virtue and wisdom, and injustice equals vice and ignorance, i bounced to another topic:

aight, i said, thrasymachus, that matter’s settled; but didn’t we also say that injustice got mad strength – you feel me?

yeah, i remember, he said, but don’t go thinkin’ i’m vibin’ with your take or that i’ve got no comeback; if i were to drop an answer, you’d totally call me out for goin’ off; so either let me spill my tea, or if you wanna fire questions, do it, and i’ll hit you with a “very good” – like how they nod at those old storytellers – and drop a yes or no.

def not, i said, if it ain’t really your vibe.

yeah, he said, i will – just to keep you happy, since you ain’t lettin’ me speak. what else you want?

nothing in the world, i said; and if you’re down, i’ll ask and you gotta answer.

fire away.

then, i’ll repeat the question i dropped before, so our deep dive into justice versus injustice stays on track. someone said that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, but now that we’ve pegged justice as wisdom and virtue, it’s clear that justice beats injustice (if injustice is just straight-up ignorance) – and that’s unarguable. but i wanna flip the script, thrasymachus: you ain’t gonna disagree that a state can be totally crooked and even try to enslave other states, or might already have 'em on lockdown, right?

true, he replied; and i’d add that the dopest, most perfectly crooked state is the prime candidate to do that.

i know, i said, that’s your whole vibe; but here’s my twist: can that mad power of the top state roll without justice, or does it only pop off when justice is in the mix?

if you’re right and justice equals wisdom, then it only rolls with justice; but if i’m right, then it can run wild without justice.

i’m straight-up vibin’, thrasymachus, seeing you nod both yes and no and droppin’ some fire answers.

that’s just courtesy for you, he replied.

you’re too kind, i said; now do me a solid and tell me—do you think a state, an army, or even a crew of robbers and thieves (or any gang of evildoers) could even roll if they started messin’ with each other?

nah, for sure, he said – they wouldn’t last.

but if they kept it chill and didn’t hurt each other, then they could squad up better?

yeah.

and that’s 'cause crookedness just sparks mad divisions, beef, and chaos, while justice drops harmony and squad goals; right, thrasymachus?

i totally vibe with that, he said, ‘cause i’m not tryna throw hands with you.

mad props, i said; but i gotta know—since injustice always courts beef wherever it pops off (among slaves or free peeps), wouldn’t it just make everyone turn on each other and wreck any chance of squad action?

definitely.

and even if only two peeps are doin’ injustice, wouldn’t they end up beefin’ and clashing, turnin’ enemy not only with each other but with the just crowd too?

they sure will.

and if injustice chills in just one person, do you reckon they lose their natural power or keep it?

let’s assume they keep their power.

but seriously, isn’t the force of injustice such that wherever it sets up shop – be it in a city, an army, a fam, or any crew – that squad ends up all over the place, unable to unite ‘cause of constant sedition and distraction? doesn’t it turn them into their own worst enemy and start beef with anyone that opposes them, including the just?

yes, totally.

and isn’t injustice just as fatal when it’s locked in one person – first makin’ him unable to act 'cause he’s not vibin’ with himself, and second, turnin’ him into an enemy of both himself and the just? true, thrasymachus?

yes.

and yo, my dude, i said, the gods are legit just, right?

granted they are.

but if that’s the case, then the crooked are basically enemies of the gods, and the just are on the gods’ squad?

feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; i won’t step in, ‘cause i ain’t tryna ruffle the squad’s vibes.

alright then, drop your answers, and let me grab the rest of my snack. we already showed that the just are hella smarter, better, and more boss than the crooked, and the crooked can’t squad up at all; plus, talkin’ 'bout totally evil dudes ever vibin’ together is off – ‘cause if they were completely evil, they’d just end up clashing with each other; clearly, there’s some leftover justice in 'em that even lets them combine – otherwise, they’d wreck each other along with their victims. they’re just half-ass villains in their hustle; if they were full-on villains and utterly crooked, they’d be completely incapable of rollin’. that’s the real tea, not what you dropped at first. but whether the just live a way better, happier life than the crooked is another level we gotta dive into. i reckon they do, based on all the deets i just laid out; but i still wanna break it down further, ‘cause we’re talkin’ about the very rule of human life here.

fire away.

now, imma ask: wouldn’t you say a horse has a purpose?

i would.

and the purpose or use of a horse – or of anything – is basically that thing which no other tool can hit, or can’t hit as hard?

i’m not vibin’ – what’s that mean? he said.

lemme break it down: can you see without using your eyes?

certainly not.

or hear without your ears?

nope.

so, these are legit the purposes of those organs, right?

they are.

but yo, you can cut a vine branch with a dagger or a chisel, or a bunch of other tools, right?

of course.

but not as smoothly as with a pruning-hook made for that exact job?

true.

so, can we say that the purpose of a pruning-hook is exactly that?

we can.

now, i think you’re catchin’ my drift about askin’ whether the purpose of anything is that which no other thing can do, or can’t do as well.

i get your meaning, he said, noddin’ in agreement.

and that whatever’s got a purpose also has its own excellence? do i really need to ask if the eye’s got a purpose?

it does.

and doesn’t the eye also have some mad excellence?

yes.

and the ear’s got a purpose and its own excellence too?

true.

and same goes for all other things – each thing has a purpose and its own special excellence?

exactly.

so, can eyes even do their job if they lose their own inherent swag and end up with defects?

how would they, he said, if they’re blind and can’t see?

you mean, if they lose the very excellence that is sight? but i’m not there yet. i just wanna ask generally whether things that nail their purpose do so because they got the proper excellence, and if they’re deficient, they totally flop.

definitely, he replied.

i could say the same for ears; when they lose their proper excellence, they can’t hit their purpose, right?

true.

and that vibe applies to everything else too?

i agree.

now, what about the soul – doesn’t it have a purpose that nothing else can fulfill? like, to boss up, command, deliberate, and all that? aren’t those functions totally meant for the soul, and can’t be handed off to anyone else?

to literally no one else.

and ain’t life itself one of the soul’s major goals?

assuredly, he said.

and doesn’t the soul also have its own dope excellence?

yes.

so, can it still nail its goals if it’s stripped of that excellence?

it just can’t.

then, an evil soul is bound to be a wack ruler and boss, while a good soul is gonna be a lit ruler, right?

yes, no cap, necessarily.

and we already dropped that justice is the soul’s supreme excellence and injustice is its major flaw?

that’s locked in.

so, the just soul and the just dude will live dope, and the crooked dude will live rough?

that’s exactly what your argument proves.

and the one livin’ well is blessed and happy, while the one livin’ rough is basically cursed and miserable?

certainly.

so, the just are happy and the crooked are miserable?

so be it.

but bein’ happy instead of miserable is where the real profit is at.

of course.

then, my blessed thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable than justice.

let this, socrates, he said, be your binge-worthy entertainment at the bendidea.

for that, i’m kinda owe you, i said, now that you’ve chilled out and stopped throwin’ shade at me. still, i wasn’t exactly entertained – but that’s on me, not you. like, it’s as if an epicurean dude grabs a taste of every dish as they roll by without ever stoppin’ to savor the last one; so i hopped from one topic to the next without actually nailin’ down what i originally sought – the real nature of justice. i bailed on that quest and switched gears to debate whether justice equals virtue and wisdom or is just pure evil and dumb; and when another question about the perks of justice versus injustice popped off, i couldn’t help but dive in. and the final tea of this whole sesh? i know nothin’ at all. i got no clue what justice really is, so i can’t say whether it’s a virtue or a flop, nor can i tell if the just dude’s truly happy or totally bummed out.

book ii.

with those words, i figured i’d wrapped up the convo; but real talk, that end was just the kickoff. glaucon, always the most trigger-happy dude, wasn’t down with thrasymachus bouncin’ – he was all, “let’s throw down for real.” so he hit me with, “socrates, you tryna actually school us, or just fakin’ like you convinced us that bein’ just is always better than bein’ crooked?”

i’d really love to school you, i replied, if i could.

then, clearly, you ain’t nailed it. now lemme ask: how would you sort out the goods – aren’t there some things we stan just for their own vibe, independent of any follow-up perks, like harmless pleasures that hit different in the moment even if nothing extra drops later?

i totally vibe with that idea, i replied.

and ain’t there also a second squad of goods – like knowledge, sight, health – that are dope not only on their own but also for the glow-ups they bring?

certainly, i said.

yo, wouldn't you peep a third squad like gym class vibes, sick-care crew, and doc skills; plus all those money-making side hustles—lowkey they do us good but we still think they're kinda sus; nobody's choosing 'em for the pure feels, only 'cause they bring that extra clout or reward, no cap.

yeah, there's a third crew too. but why you askin'?

straight up, i wanna know—in your three-tier menu, where you droppin' justice?

i replied, "it's in the supreme squad—the kind of glow-up a true vibe-seeker wants both for the pure feels and for that epic payoff."

then a bunch of peeps be like, "nah fam, justice is actually in the sus squad—it's all about chasing clout and receipts, but on its own, it's hella meh and best left ghosted."

i know, i said, that's literally their flex, and that was exactly the tea thrasymachus was droppin' just now—roasting justice and hyping up injustice. but real talk, i'm too stupid to get swayed by his cringey drip.

i wish, he said, that you tuned into my vibe as hard as you did his, then we'd see if we’re on the same wavelength. like, thrasymachus got snagged by your voice like a snake mesmerized by sick beats, but honestly, the real lowdown on justice and injustice is still mad foggy for me. ditching all that clout and reward talk, i wanna know what they are deep down and how they work on the soul. if you’re cool, then imma resurrect thrasymachus’s argument. first up, imma spill the tea on the nature and origin of justice as the squad normally sees it; next, i'll flex that every dude who plays justice is doing it on auto-pilot outta necessity—not 'cause it’s inherently lit; and finally, imma hit you with the fact that, if their claim is on point, the shady life is way more fire than being straight-up just—though, socrates, i'm not about that vibe myself. still, i gotta admit, my ears are drowning in thrasymachus and a million other voices, and i've yet to hear anyone convincingly proving that justice trumps injustice on its own. i need to hear justice hyped for the sake of pure justice; then i'll chill, and i know you're the plug who can drop that tea. so imma go full send praising the unjust life, and my flow will show how i wanna see you hype justice and roast injustice. you down with that plan?

i'm totally vibing with it; honestly, i can't think of anything more lit to rap about.

i'm hella hyped to hear that, he replied, so imma kick off by dropping the deets on the nature and roots of justice.

they be sayin' that dishing out injustice is lowkey a win, while catchin' it is hella bad—but the bad vibes always outweigh the good. so when peeps have both served and taken injustice, and can't dodge one or snag the other, they squad up and be like, "nah, let's just skip this game," and boom—laws and mutual deals drop in. whatever gets stamped by law becomes what they call legit and just. this is the tea on justice’s origin—a remix between the dopest move of doing injustice and dodging punishment, and the worst-case of suffering injustice with zero recoil; justice just lands in the middle, not lit as a win, but as the lesser evil, respected only 'cause folks ain't got the juice to be blatantly unjust. cuz real ones, who actually earn their stripes, would never sign up for that lame deal if they could fight it off—they'd be straight trippin'. that's the ancient account, socrates, on how justice came to be.

now, peep this: the real tea on peeps who ride justice is that they do it involuntarily, 'cause they ain't got the power to be shady. to get the full picture, imagine if both the just and the unjust had full-on free reign—let's watch where their cravings take 'em. you'd see that both squads end up chasing what they think is their ultimate win, but only get shoved onto the justice track by the law's hard push. and that freedom? it’d be cranked up if we call it the power that gyges—ancestor of croesus from lydia—was rumored to have. word on the street is, gyges was just a shepherd grindin' for the lydia king; when a mega storm and earthquake cracked the ground where he was chillin' with his flock, my dude slid down and discovered a hollow bronze horse with doors. there, he peeped a dead homie, lookin' larger-than-life and rockin' nothing but a gold ring. he yeeted that ring off the corpse and bounced back up. later, when the shepherd crew gathered to drop their monthly report to the king, gyges strolled in with that ring. while he was kickin' it, he accidentally flipped the ring’s collar inward—boom, he went invisible, and the squad started chattin' like he dipped. he was shook, so he twisted it back outward and reappeared. after a few tests—same drill: inward equals vanish, outward equals visible—he plotted his move, got picked as one of the court's runners, and once there, seduced the queen. with her help, he clapped the king and snatched the whole kingdom. now, picture if there were two magic rings—one on the just crew and one on the shady crew; no dude's got the guts to stick to pure justice if he could flex being shady. honestly, no one would leave cash on the table, or pass up swiping what isn't theirs at the market, or crash any crib for a chill sesh, or even off someone from jail, if they could safely do it, flexing like a god among mortals. then, the moves of the just and the shady would look identical—they’d both end up at the same point. and that's solid proof that no one is just by choice or 'cause they think justice ups their personal game—they only roll with justice 'cause they can't safely be shady. deep down, every soul knows that dodgy moves bring way more wins than being on the level, and anyone vibin' with my theory will agree. imagine someone with that invisibility clout who never does wrong or touches someone else's stash—they’d be seen as a major clown by the watchers, even though they'd get secret props out of fear of catching injustice themselves. enough of that hot mess.

alright, if we wanna seriously judge the just life versus the shady life, we gotta isolate 'em—no mixing allowed. how we do that? here’s the play: let the shady dude be 100% shady, and the just homie be 100% just; nothing gets cut, and both come fully loaded for their own grind. first up, let the shady guy be like a boss-level pro—like a slick pilot or next-level doctor who knows his limits and can bounce back if he slips. so, let him pull off his shady moves the right way and keep it on the DL if he wants to level up in injustice (because if he gets caught, he's done for—nobody's buying that). the ultimate of being shady is when you're falsely tagged as just, even though you're not. so i say, in a truly shady dude, we gotta assume he deploys the peak of injustice; no discounts allowed, but still he scores the highest rep for appearing just while doing the most off moves. if he stumbles, he better be able to recover fast; he’s gotta be smooth on the mic if his moves leak, and use his strength, cash, and squad power to bulldoze through when needed. meanwhile, right next to him, we got the truly just guy—noble and simple, actually wanting to be good instead of just lookin' it—like aeschylus said, to be and not just seem. there should be zero fakin', 'cause if a dude only seems just, he'll rack up honors and rewards, and then we can’t tell if he’s truly just or just chasin' clout; so let him be draped in only genuine justice, with no extra flair; picture him livin' the complete opposite life from the shady one. let him be the best of men, even if the world thinks he's the worst—then his real self gets tested. and let him ride that vibe all the way to the grave, being just inside while appearin' shady outside. when both push to the extremes—the one on justice and the one on injustice—let's drop the final verdict: which one ends up truly happier?

bro, my dear glaucon, i said, how you shinin' these up for the showdown—like you're polishing two statues one after the other.

i do my best, he replied. now that we peep their true profiles, it's easy to map out the life path awaiting each. imma break it down now; but if my description comes off a bit raw, socrates, just roll with it and imagine these words coming straight from the eulogists of injustice: they'll tell you that the just dude who gets tagged as shady ends up getting whipped, tortured, tied up—have his eyes burned out; and then, after catchin' every kind of L, he even gets impaled. then he realizes he should just look the part and not actually be just; aeschylus's lines might actually vibe better for the shady crew than the truly just. cuz the unjust are chasing the real deal—they don’t live for appearance; they wanna be actual shady, not just seem it.

"his mind got that deep, fertile dirt where all his dope brain moves just spring up, no cap."

first off, peeps see him as straight-up just, so he runs the city scene; he can marry whoever he wants and even hook up others, trade and deal wherever, always flipping it to his own advantage 'cause he ain't got no guilt about being shady; in every matchup—public or private—he claps his rivals, cashes in on their losses, stacks that paper, and uses his gains to boost his friends and wreck his enemies. on top of that, he can drop lavish sacrifices and epic gifts to the gods, and honor whoever he pleases way better than the truly just, meaning he's likely even more favored by the gods. so, socrates, it's like gods and mortals team up to make the shady life way more baller than the just life.

i was about to drop some words to glaucon when adeimantus, his bro, jumped in: "socrates, you ain't gonna tell us there's nothing else to add, right?"

i was like, "c'mon, what else is there to yeet?"

he shot back, "yo, you missed the absolute strongest flex of them all."

aight, then, as the old saying goes, "let brother help brother"—if a dude flops anywhere, you gotta back him up; even tho, i gotta admit, glaucon already spilled enough tea to put me on blast and strip me of any clout in boosting justice.

nah, bogus, he replied. but lemme drop some extra tea: there's another angle to glaucon’s whole spiel on praising and trashing justice versus injustice—which you gotta catch to get his drift. basically, our parents and teachers are always on us about staying just; but why? not for the love of justice itself, but for rep and clout—in hopes that if you're known as just, you unlock dope offices, marriages, and all those perks glaucon mentioned that shady folks get from the rep of justice. plus, this crew cares more about the looks than the real deal; they even throw in the gods' blessing and hype up how a shower of benefits rains on the pious—as told by the noble hesiod and homer. hesiod drops lines sayin' that the gods make the oaks of the just "bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle; and the sheep get bowed down by their heavy fleeces," and serves up a load of similar epic blessings. homer’s on the same beat: he hypes up a dude whose rep is "like that of a flawless king who, like a god, keeps it just; to whom the black earth drops wheat and barley, whose trees are loaded with fruit, and his sheep never bail, while the sea hooks him up with fish."

and yo, the heavenly gifts for the just are even next-level—musaeus and his son drop blessings straight into the mortal realm, where saints are chillin' on couches at eternal ragers, always smashed and crowned with garlands; apparently, an everlasting binge is the ultimate badge of virtue. some even say that the squad of the faithful and just will flex their legacy through third and fourth generations. that's the vibe when they hype justice. but when it comes to the wicked, they flip the script: they dump them in a gross slough in hades, making 'em haul water with a broken sieve; plus, while they're still livin', they drag their names through the mud and hit 'em with all the punishments glaucon described for those just dudes who are mistaken as shady—nothing extra in their punishment toolkit. that's how they serve praise for one and throw major shade for the other.

once more, socrates, lemme ask you to peep another angle on justice and injustice—a spin not just from the poets, but also from the straight-up prose voices. the universal voice of mankind keeps shoutin' that justice and virtue are mad respectable but hella heavy and toilsome; meanwhile, the perks of vice and being shady are super accessible, only gettin' clapped for by law and public opinion. they even say that being honest is usually less profitable than dodgy moves; and they're quick to call bad dudes happy, hyping 'em publicly and privately when they're rich or influential, while dissing and ghosting the weak and broke—even though deep down, they know those weakies are better than the rest. but the wildest flex is how they rap about virtue and the gods: they claim the gods dole out mad misery to way too many good peeps, while blessing the shady ones with all the good vibes. then, those hustlin' prophets show up at rich dudes' doors, convincing them that they've been handed divine power to clear a man’s or his ancestors' sins through sacrifices, charms, epic feasts, and ragers; promising to smack an enemy—just for a small fee—using magic and incantations that supposedly bind the heavens to their will. and the poets? they’re the OG authorities who smooth out the path of vice with hesiod’s bars: "vice may be had in abundance without any hassle; the way's smooth and her crib is right nearby. but before virtue, the gods set you on a grind," a tedious uphill hustle. then they drop homer as witness that even the gods can get swayed by mortals; like, he says, "the gods, too, can be turned from their groove; and dudes pray to them, dodging their wrath with sacrifices, chill entreaties, libations, and that bomb aroma of fat when they've totally screwed up."

and then they serve up a whole squad of books by musaeus and orpheus—the so-called kids of the moon and the muses, as they claim—in which they flex their ritual moves and convince not just individuals but entire cities that you can wipe your sin slate clean with sacrifices and dope distractions that fill a free hour, serving both the living and the dead; for the dead, they call it "mysteries," which are supposed to redeem us from hellish pain, but if we ghost 'em, no one even knows what epic L awaits.

he proceeded: "and now, when the youngins catch all this chatter about virtue and vice, and how gods and mortals rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i'm talkin' about the quick-witted crew, buzzing like bees all over every dope flower, scooping up all these takes on what kinda peeps they should be and how they should roll if they wanna live their best life. probably these youth will be like quoting pindar in their head: 'can i, by keepin' it just or by flexin' some crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people be sayin' that if i'm truly just and also seen as just, there's zero profit—instead, you'll only suffer mad pain and losses. but if, while bein' shady, i score the rep of justice, then a heavenly life is on the menu. since philosophers proved that appearances flex harder than truth and rule the happiness game, i gotta ride that look. i'll deck out the front of my crib with a picture-perfect vibe of virtue; and behind the scenes, i'll let a sly, crafty fox shadow my moves—just as archilochus, the dopest of sages, recommends. and sure, i hear some peep yellin' that hidin' your shady deets is mad difficult; to that, i say, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth, we'll set up secret crews and underground political clubs. plus, there are straight-up rhetoric profs teachin' how to sway courts and assemblies; so, mixin' smooth talk with a bit of muscle, i can snag illegal gains and dodge the heat. and yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be fooled or forced. but what if there are no gods—or if they could care less about human drama? then why sweat about stayin' lowkey? and even if the gods are on our side, we only know 'em from legends and poet family trees—the very same folks who claim they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it 100: either we buy it all or we don't. if the poets are droppin' straight facts, then we had better be shady AF and cash in on those unjust gains; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge cosmic revenge, we'll miss out on the sweet wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating between sinning and prayin', the gods get all appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future crew will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the reflection—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with epic power. that's what the major cities be proclaimin', and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same truth.

. . .

so then he went on, "and now when the young bloods get all this talk on virtue and vice, and how gods and peeps rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i mean, the sharp ones—buzzin' like bees across every dope flower and snatching up conclusions about how they should roll—might be like, in the words of pindar, 'can i, by bein' just or by pullin' off crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people say if i'm actually just and also seen as just, then there’s zero profit—and you'll only rack up pain and loss. but if, while bein' shady, i secure the rep of justice, then a heavenly life gets promised to me. since philosophers proved that appearances straight-up rule over truth and happiness, i gotta devote myself to that vibe. i'll set up a dope picture of virtue as the entrance and face of my crib; and behind it, i'll let the subtle, crafty fox of deception trail my moves, just like archilochus—the dopest sage—recommended. sure, i hear someone shout that hidin' your shady side is mad tough; to that, i hit back, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the whole argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth mode, we'll form secret brotherhoods and underground political clubs. plus, there are rhetoric professors droppin' lessons on persuading courts and assemblies; so, partly with slick talk and partly with muscle, i can snag illegal gains and avoid the heat. yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be tricked or forced. but what if there are no gods? or, if they literally don't give a damn about human biz—why should we even sweat the stealth? and even if the gods are out there, we only know 'em from legends and poet fam trees—and those same poets drop that they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it real: either we buy into it all or we don't. if the poets are spittin' truth, then we had better go full shady and bank on the gains of injustice; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge heaven's vengeance, we lose out on the unlawful wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating sinning and prayin'—sinning and prayin'—the gods get appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future squad will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the takeaway—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with major clout. that's the word from the big leagues, and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same testimony.

on what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice? like, if we just squad up the worst injustice with some extra shady flex on appearances, then both the gods and the homies in life and in the afterlife are totally vibing with that, as the most extra and highest authorities be preaching. now, socrates, with all that cosmic tea in play, how in the world is any dude with extra smarts, clout, rank, or stacks ever gonna be down to honor justice—or even chill enough not to crack up when justice gets hyped? and even if some genius comes around to drop the truth bomb that justice is the real mvp, he still ain’t throwing fits at the baddie crew; he’s hella down to forgive ’em, ‘cause he knows straight up that peeps don’t just pick justice by free will—unless, of course, some inner divine flex inspires a savage hate for injustice or he unlocks the secret sauce of truth (and no other normie can claim that). honestly, only the weak sauce who, thanks to being a total wuss, old, or just low on clout, can’t even flex being unjust will end up roasting injustice; and, no cap, as soon as that weak sauce gets the power, he goes full-on unjust mode, doing the maximum diss.

yo, the root of all this, socrates, was already dropped at the start of our chat, when my bro and i were like, “we were shook that among all the justice squad—right from the ancient hero legends (whose drip has been preserved for us) to the modern-day peeps—not one of these justice clout preachers ever dissed injustice or hyped justice except to flex the glories, honors, and epic perks that come with them.” no one has ever seriously laid down in verse or prose the true core vibe of either justice or injustice chillin’ in the soul, hidden from the mortal or the divine eye; or shown that, out of all the swag in a man’s soul, justice is the ultimate boss buff and injustice the sickest debuff. if that lit vibe had been the universal track, if y’all had been schooling us on that since back in the day, none of us would’ve been out here on guard trying to stop each other from going off—instead, every dude would’ve been his own bouncer, scared that a wrong move would load him up with the deadliest virus. i’d bet that thrasymachus and the rest would be lowkey saying that the words i’m droppin’—or even harsher ones—about justice and injustice are, in my honest flex, totally twisting their true nature. but i’m spitting this heat in all that passionate fashion, gotta be real with y’all, ‘cause i wanna hear your flip side; and i need you to show not only that justice slaps way harder than injustice, but also break down what kind of glow-up they give to whoever holds ‘em—making one a straight-up good boi and the other a total villain, whether the gods and the homies can peep it or not.

i always had mad respect for the genius of glaucón and adeimantus, but when these words dropped, i was hella hyped and was like, “sons of an illustrious father, that was a chill kickoff to the elegiac verses our biggest fan dropped for you after you absolutely clapped at the battle of megara:— ‘sons of ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’” that title is bang on, ‘cause there’s something totally divine about debating the superiority of injustice while still being unconvinced by your own drip. and i seriously feel that y’all ain’t even vibing with your own argument—i can peep that just from your overall aura, ‘cause if i was only judging by your soundbites, i’d be throwing major shade. but now, the more i trust your genius vibes, the tougher it is for me to pick the right words. i’m caught between two modes; on one side, i feel like i’m not cut out for this epic flex, and on the other, i’m low on clout ‘cause you weren’t down with the answer i threw at thrasymachus proving that justice is the ultimate upgrade over injustice. yet, i can’t just ghost the convo while i still got breath and words to drop; i fear it’d be a straight-up sin to sit back and let justice get clapped without throwing down a defense. so, i gotta step up and drop whatever fire i got.

glaucón and the rest were all up in my dms begging me not to let the deep dive drop, but to keep probing the truth about justice and injustice and their relative wins. i told them straight up that this quest is gonna be a heavy-duty ride, and it’s gonna need some next-level vision to nail it. so, i was like, “since we’re not exactly the einsteins of the century, we should roll with a hack: imagine a peep with super bad eyesight is asked to read tiny text from afar; then someone is like, ‘yo, maybe these words are over here where they’re bigger’—if it’s the same text and he can read the big letters first and then the small ones, that’d be a rare lucky flex.”

“very true,” said adeimantus; “but how does that vibe drop into our inquiry?”

“i’ll break it down,” i replied; “justice, the main tea of our quest, is sometimes dropped as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the overall vibe of a state.”

“true,” he replied.

“and a state is def bigger than a single homie, right?”

“it is.”

“then in the bigger picture, justice is likely more massive and easier to peep. i propose we scope out the nature of justice and injustice first as they roll in the state, and then zoom in on the individual—going from big to small and comparing the vibes.”

“bet, that’s a killer plan.”

“and if we picture the state while it’s still in beta, we’re gonna see justice and injustice emerging along with it.”

“i dare say so.”

“and once the state hits its full release, maybe the cheat-code to our search will drop even easier.”

“yes, far more easily.”

“but yo, should we even try building one? honestly, to construct one is a mega serious flex. think on that.”

“i’ve been thinking, and i’m hyped for you to keep it rolling,” adeimantus said.

so i said, “a state pops off, in my view, from the wild needs of mankind; no one’s riding solo, ‘cause we all got mad wants. can you even imagine any other OG origin for a state?”

“there’s literally no other way.”

“then, since we all got a bunch of needs and a crew is needed to cover ‘em, you grab a helper for one vibe and another for a different one; and when you gather all these partners in one crib, boom—that’s a state.”

“true,” he said.

“and they’re swapping with each other—one drops his goods and the other picks ‘em up—thinking the trade’s gonna be a win-win, a straight flex for everyone.”

“very true.”

“so, let’s start by building a mental state; but remember, the true creator here is necessity, the original mom of our hustle.”

“of course,” he replied.

“now, the numero uno and biggest need is food—the fuel for life.”

“definitely.”

“next up is a crib, and then fresh threads and all that.”

“true.”

“and now, let’s see how our city can handle this major demand: suppose one dude’s a farmer, another’s a builder, someone else slays as a weaver—should we throw in a shoemaker, or maybe another peep to cover our bodily needs?”

“exactly right.”

“in the most basic blueprint of a state, you gotta have like four or five peeps.”

“for real.”

“and how they grind? will each homie drop the fruits of his hustle into a common stash—like the farmer producing extra for the squad, hustling four times as hard to feed not just himself but everyone; or will he ghost collaborating and only handle his own chunk of the feed in a fraction of the time, then spend the rest of his grind building a crib, a coat, or kicks—doing his own thing without teaming up, just handling his own biz?”

adeimantus was like, “i think it’s better if he just focuses on farming instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.”

“probably,” i replied, “that’s the smarter play; and hearing that reminds me that we’re all built diff—our natures are prepped for different hustles.”

“very true.”

“and yo, isn’t a task way more on point when a homie sticks to one gig rather than juggling a whole buffet of work?”

“when he’s on one, it’s def better.”

“plus, no cap, a job is straight-up doomed if it ain’t done at the right moment.”

“no doubt.”

“business isn’t waiting for the homie to chill; he’s gotta lock in his hustle and make it his top priority.”

“facts.”

“so, if that’s the case, then everything gets produced more smoothly, in bulk, and with better quality when a dude just does the one thing he’s naturally built for at the perfect time and leaves the rest alone.”

“undoubtedly.”

“hence, we need more than four citizens; ’cause the farmer ain’t gonna whip up his own plow or mattock if he wants them to perform, and the builder won’t craft his own tools—he’s gonna need a squad; same goes for the weaver and the shoemaker.”

“true.”

“so then carpenters, smiths, and a whole bunch of other artisans will be part of our little state that’s already starting to grow?”

“true.”

“and even if we add herdsmen, shepherds, and other animal handlers—so our farmer squad can cop oxen for plowing, and builders and farmers can get draft cattle, while curriers and weavers score fleeces and hides—our state is still gonna be pretty modest.”

“that’s true; but it won’t be super tiny either as long as all these peeps are in the mix.”

“then, again, there’s the sitch of the city—finding a spot where nothing needs to be imported is basically impossible.”

“impossible.”

“so there must be another class of citizens who roll in with the goods from another city, right?”

“there has to be.”

“if a trader rolls up empty-handed with nothing for the peeps who need him, he’s just gonna bounce back with nada.”

“that’s for sure.”

“so what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but also so epic in both quantity and quality that it hooks up those who bring in the missing vibes.”

“very true.”

“then more farmers and more artisans will be needed?”

“they will.”

“not to mention the importers and exporters, aka the merchants?”

“yes.”

“then we’re gonna need merchants?”

“we are.”

“and if merchandise has to be carried over the sea, mad skilled sailors are gonna be needed in huge numbers?”

“yes, in huge numbers.”

“then, back in the city, how do they swap their drip? setting up that exchange was, as you remember, one of our main moves when we squad’d up and formed a state.”

“clearly, they’re gonna be buying and selling.”

“so they’re gonna need a marketplace, plus some coin—a money-token—for smooth exchanges.”

“definitely.”

“imagine now if a farmer or artisan brings his goods to market and shows up when there’s nobody around to trade—does he just dip and chill, leaving his hustle behind?”

“not at all; he’ll find peeps there who, spotting the gap, step in as the official sales crew. in well-run states, these are usually the ones who aren’t exactly jacked up—low on muscle and thus not too useful for heavy lifting—so their only gig is to chill in the market, swapping cash for goods with sellers and grabbing coin from buyers.”

“this need creates a class of retail traders in our state. isn’t ‘retailer’ the term for those holding down the market spot, while the roaming squad between cities get dubbed merchants?”

“yes, exactly.”

“and then there’s another crew of workers who might not be brainiacs but are jacked enough for heavy labor—they sell their strength and are called, if i’m not tripping, hirelings (with ‘hire’ being the tag on the price of their grind).”

“true.”

“so hirelings help bulk up our population?”

“yes.”

“and now, adeimantus, is our state all leveled up and perfect?”

“i think so.”

“then, where’s justice and where’s injustice, and in which corner of the state did they drop in?”

“i’d say they pop off in the way these citizens interact with each other. i can’t see them cropping up anywhere else.”

“i dare say you’re onto something,” i said; “we’d better really think this through and not shy away from the inquiry.”

“let’s then peep their way of life now that our state is on lock. won’t they be growing corn, brewing wine, sewing threads, cobbling shoes, and building cribs for themselves? and once they’re housed, they’ll be grinding all summer—usually stripped down and barefoot—but in winter, they’re gonna be decked out with full gear and kicks. they’ll chow down on grub like barley-meal and wheat dough, baking and kneading them into noble cakes and loaves; served up on reed mats or clean leaves while they chill on beds dotted with yew or myrtle vibes. then, they and their kiddos will go all out feasting—sipping the wine they brewed, rocking garlands on their dome, and hyping the gods in a lit hangout session. plus, they’ll keep it real by making sure their fam stays within budget, always watchful of poverty or the threat of war.”

“but,” interjected glaucón, “hold up—you didn’t add any extra flavor or relish to their meal, did you?”

“true,” i replied, “i totally spaced that—of course they gotta have a killer relish: salt, olives, and cheese, with roots and herbs boiled up just like the country peeps do; for dessert, we’ll dish out figs, peas, and beans; and they’ll roast myrtle berries and acorns over the fire, sipping moderately. with a menu like that, they’re set to live in peace and health for ages and pass down that vibe to their kiddos.”

“yes, socrates,” he said, “and if you were feeding a city of pigs, how else would you keep the beasts fed?”

“but what would you have, glaucón?” i replied.

“dude, you gotta hook them up with the everyday luxuries—soft sofas to chill on, fancy tables to dine off, and modern sauces and sweets to keep it lit.”

“yeah,” i said, “now i catch your drift: you want me to explore not just the basics of a state but also how to build a deluxe, luxury state; and honestly, no harm in that, ‘cause in a deluxe state we might see how justice and injustice really pop off. in my opinion, the true and healthy constitution of a state is the one i just laid out—but if you’re also about that extra hype, i’m down. i suspect plenty of peeps won’t settle for the simple life. they’ll be about adding sofas, tables, and a whole lot of extra flair; along with gourmet treats, dainties, perfumes, incense, courtesans, cakes in every flavor—not just one kind, but mad varieties. we’d be pushing past the basic needs of cribs, threads, and kicks: the arts like painting and embroidery would have to get in on the hustle, and gold, ivory, and pretty much every kind of bling would need to be snatched up.”

“true,” he said.

“then we gotta expand our borders, ‘cause the OG healthy state just won’t cut it. now the city will have to swell with a massive crew of extra gigs that aren’t needed for the bare necessities—like an entire tribe of hunters and performers (one squad handling visuals and colors, another squad dropping beats and rhymes with poets, players, dancers, and managers), plus makers of all kinds of goods (even women’s dresses). and we’ll need even more assistants. won’t there be a serious need for tutors, nurses (both wet and dry), tirewomen, barbers, bakers, and cooks; and even pig herders, who weren’t on the roster before but are now totally in demand? they can’t be forgotten—and if peeps are munching on animals, a bunch of other critters will be needed too.”

“definitely.”

“and living all this luxe, we’re gonna need way more physicians than before, right?”

“way more.”

“plus, the land that used to support the original crew will be way too cramped now.”

“totally true.”

“then we’ll have to snag a slice of our neighbors’ land for extra pasture and farming, and they might end up wanting a slice of ours too if, like us, they overdo the flex and chase endless wealth.”

“that, socrates, is inevitable.”

“and so, glaucón, looks like we’re heading to war, huh?”

“most certainly,” he replied.

“then, without even deciding whether war is a win or a fail, one thing’s for sure: war comes from the same wild causes that brew nearly every evil in both private and public states.”

“undoubtedly.”

“and our state must expand again—and this time, the upgrade is straight-up an army that has to roll out and battle invaders for every bit of what we got, as well as for the peeps and goods we just broke down.”

“why though?” he asked; “aren’t they strong enough to defend themselves?”

“no,” i said, “not if we stick with that principle we all peeped when we built the state: one dude just can’t nail a bunch of arts at once.”

“very true,” he replied.

“but like, isn’t war an art in itself?”

“definitely.”

“and an art that needs as much focus as, say, shoemaking?”

“definitely, no cap.”

and yo, our squad straight up banned the shoemaker from doing extra gigs like farming, weaving, or building—cuz we needed those kicks on fleek, no cap; each homie got one designated grind that just vibes with their natural drip, and they had to stick to that hustle for life, fr only that gig. no one’s allowed to ghost their chance to level up, else their work game stays lame. honestly, nothing is a bigger flex than soldiers nailing their battle hustle.

but like, can you really think war is such a chill skill to pick up that a dude can be a warrior while also doing farming, shoemaking, or any other artisanal hustle? cuz ngl, no one’s ever been lit at dice or checkers if they just dabble for fun without grinding hardcore from day one. no fancy gear can turn you into a boss workman or defense master if you never put in the hours learning the moves. so how in this meme-filled kingdom is some dude gonna grab a shield or any war gadget and go full fighter in a single day, whether he’s squad-dealin’ heavy fire or rocking any other troop flex?

yeah, he dropped that those epic tools teaching peeps how to use their own gear are straight up priceless, no cap.

and i was like, yo, the bigger the guardian job gets, the more major hours, sick skills, savage art, and hustle are gonna be required, right?

no doubt, fam, he snapped back.

and don't forget, he gotta be born with that clutch vibe for the hustle, right?

straight up, no cap.

so basically, it's on us to flex our selection game and scoop up those natty types who are a perfect match for guarding the city’s crib, bet?

for real, it will.

and i was like, yo, picking these guardians ain’t a walk in the park, but we gotta be bold and put in all our savage effort.

bet, we absolutely must.

aren't the noble youngins just like a snatched, well-bred pupper when it comes to guarding and peeping?

what's that even vibe though?

i mean, both gotta be super on point with their vision, hella fast in catching enemy lurkers, and straight up buff enough to throw down when it's go time.

all those dope traits, he iced, are an absolute must for the guardian squad.

and i mean, your guardian gotta have guts if they're gonna wreck it in battle, right?

100%, definitely.

and honestly, can a dude be brave with zero spunk, whether he's riding a hooptie, flexing like a pupper, or reppin' any beast? seriously, have you not peeped how pure spirit is untouchable and boss-level, making any soul totally fearless and unbreakable?

i mean, i've def caught that vibe.

so basically, we now got a vibe-check on the physical glow-up needed for a guardian.

facts.

and don’t sleep on the brain game too; his soul gotta be lit with spirit, eh?

hell yeah.

but yo, aren’t these extra spirited peeps prone to throw shade and go savage on each other and everyone else, fr?

he admitted that's a major diff obstacle to squash, no cap.

but i was like, they gotta be absolute beasts to their haters and total softies for their squad; otherwise, they’re gonna be self-sabotaging, crashing their own vibe before their enemies even get a chance.

facts, he clapped.

so what’s the move then? i asked—how the heck do we scoop a mellow vibe that still packs that insane spirit, cuz those two seem like total opposites?

true that.

i mean, a guardian missing either vibe is straight weak; but combining both seems like an impossible meme hack—so one might think that leveling up as a top-tier guardian is, like, a total myth.

fr, he admitted, "i’m lowkey scared that you’re absolutely right."

feeling hella confused, i started to re-evaluate the whole convo. "my dude," i said, "no surprise we’re in a total state of confusion—cuz we kinda lost the original vibe we started with, ya feel?"

he was like, "what you even mean, bro?"

i meant to drop that real talk: there are peeps out there pre-gifted with that wild combo vibe.

and like, where do we scoop these legend-status natures, huh?

i fired back, "check it: plenty of animals show us how it’s done. take the dog, for example—these high-key well-bred pups are super chill with their fam and squad, but go savage on strangers."

dude, i know that, fr.

so basically, finding a guardian with that combo is totally valid and natural, right?

for sure, not impossible.

and hold up—a guardian, besides being lit with spirit, should also come with mad philosopher vibes, right?

i’m not really catchin’ your drift, bro.

i clarified, "bro, that trait is also something you peep in dogs, and it’s straight iconic in how they roll."

which trait though?

like, yo, ever notice how a dog gets all heated when a stranger shows up but gives mad love when its homie drops by—even if the stranger never did anything shady and the buddy never did any good? pretty wild, right?

i never really peeped that before, but i gotta admit, your point’s pretty spot on.

and like, that doggy instinct is hella charming—your pupper is basically a lowkey philosopher, no lie.

why’s that, though?

cuz, see, the dog basically peels faces based solely on whether it vibes with you or not. shouldn't every creature be all about that learning life, deciding its faves based on what's known versus what's unknown?

oh for sure, 100%.

and like, isn't lovin' to learn basically lovin' wisdom, aka philosophy?

they're basically on the same vibe, he clapped.

so, can we not, with full drip, say that a dude who’s chill with his squad is naturally a wisdom and knowledge aficionado?

facts—you can bet on that.

so that means a legit epic and noble city guardian’s gotta combo that dope mix of philosophy, spirit, mad speed, and beast strength, right?

no cap—undoubtedly.

so, we've scoped out our ideal peeps; but now that we found them, how do we vibe up their education and rearing? isn't this like a major deets drop on the ultimate quest—how do justice and injustice level up in states? cuz we ain't tryna miss any lit points or drag this convo into endless scroll.

adeimantus was like, "this question is gonna be a major glow-up for our game, trust."

so i told him, my dude, we can’t just yeet this task—even if it’s a mega long haul.

100%, definitely not.

so let’s kick back, chill for an hour droppin' epic stories, and let our tale be the ultimate schooling for our future legends.

yasss, let’s get it.

so like, what’s the education recipe? can we vibe with anything better than the classic drip? cuz it splits into two major tracks: gym class for that body glow-up and music—like tunes for the soul.

facts, true that.

shall we kick off with some sweet beats and then hit the gym for that body flex?

hella yes.

and when you say music, you vibin' on lit too or nah?

i mean, totally.

and literature can be either vibe-true or totally fake?

yeah, for real.

and the kiddos gotta get schooled in both, but do we kick off with the faux tales?

he was like, "i ain't catchin' your drift here, bro."

i was like, "listen up, we start by droppin' stories for kids that might have some truth tea but are mostly made-up, and we serve these up while they're too young to hit gym class hard."

facts, totally on point.

that was my vibe when i said we gotta school 'em on music vibes before all that heavy gym hype.

he was like, "yeah, straight facts."

you also know the start of any project is the ultimate key drop—especially for young, tender things; that's when the squad’s character gets built and that epic impression lands way easier.

no doubt, facts.

and are we really gonna let kids soak up any random, throwaway stories cooked up by random peeps, planting ideas that are like total opposites of what we want their adult vibes to be?

nah fam, we cannot.

so, step one is to set up a lit censorship system for fiction writers, where the censors only let the dope stories fly and yeet the wack ones; and we gotta have moms and caretakers only sharing the approved recaps with the kiddos. let them shape their minds with those epic vibes, even more intensely than they flex on their bodies—but honestly, most of today's tales gotta bounce.

he asked, "which tales you even talkin' about, bro?"

i was like, "yo, the lesser tales reflect the big ones—they both come from the same vibe and share that same spirit, no cap."

he was like, "for sure, but i’m still lowkey confused on what you call the big ones exactly."

i said, "those are the legends spun by homer, hesiod, and the other og poets who've been mankind’s ultimate storytellers since day one."

he was like, "but which stories are you on about, and what's the big tea on their flaws?"

i dropped, "the mega diff is that they be spitting straight lies, and not just any lies—they're servin' up some seriously toxic bs."

but like, when does this epic fail occur?

basically whenever they flex a sketch of gods and heroes that’s totally off—like an artist drawing a portrait with zero vibe of the original masterpiece.

he was like, "yeah, that kind of vibe is totally trash; but which stories you even mean, bro?"

i started, "first off, there's that mega lie straight out of the high towers, where the poet dished on uranus—yeah, hesiod’s wild story about what uranus did and how cronus was like, 'bet, i'm gonna clock you.' even if cronus’s drama and his son’s savage payback were lowkey true, they shouldn’t be casually served up to young, clueless peeps; ideally, just keep that tea locked down. but if you absolutely gotta drop that mystery drop, only a chosen few should peep it, and they gotta sacrifice not some basic eleusinian pig, but like, a massive, legendary, un-findable beast—so only the real ones get in on the secret tea."

he was like, "yeah, no cap, those stories are straight-up massive cringe."

i was like, "amen, adeimantus—they're tales that should never drop in our state; our dudes shouldn't get the message that doing the worst crimes is like, no big deal, or that callin' out your old man on bein' wack is just mimicry of the og god moves."

he straight-up agreed, "i'm totally with you—those stories are not even on the menu for retweetin'."

and also, if we want our future guardians to see internal beef as totally trash, we shouldn't be droppin' any tea about celestial wars or gods schemin', cuz that's all bogus. nah, we ain't ever gonna drop battle recaps of giants or stitch those sagas on their drip; we gotta stay muted on endless godly feuds among buddies and fam. if they’d just vibe with us, we'd say, "yo, squabblin' is unholy," and that there’s literally never been any beef among citizens. that’s the vibe our OGs—old heads—should first school the kiddos on, and later, poets gotta write in that same tone. but those wild stories about hephaestus strappin' his mom down, or the time zeus yeeted him for defending her, and all those god wars in homer—nah, those tales are outright banned in our state, whether they’re deep allegories or not. cuz a young brain can’t even tell what’s metaphor and what’s literal; whatever they soak up at that age sticks like a permanent meme watermark. so it's crucial the first stories they hear are pure, epic role models of virtue.

he was like, "facts, but if any cat asks, 'where do we peep these ideal models and which tales are you spillin'?' how do we even answer that?"

i said, "bro, you and i right now aren’t just poets—we’re the og founders of this state. founders need to know the blueprint of how poets should flex their stories and the boundaries that gotta be maintained, but creatin' the stories isn’t on us."

he was like, "facts, but what exactly are these theology forms you’re on about?"

i replied, "think of it like this—god should always be dropped as he really is, no matter if it’s in an epic, lyric, or tragic style."

right on.

and like, isn’t he the ultimate good boi? shouldn’t he always be shown as such?

absolutely.

and literally, no good thing ever hurts, right?

nope, for real.

and what ain’t hurt, stays harmless, no cap?

definitely not.

and if it doesn’t hurt, it ain’t evil, yeah?

nah.

and can something that’s all good be the reason for evil, fam?

impossible, straight up.

and the good stuff is totally a major plus, right?

100%, yes.

so it’s like, the secret sauce for all that well-being?

yep.

so basically, the good only drops good vibes—it’s not behind every single thing, just the top-tier goods, right?

word, assuredly.

so like, if god is truly good, then he ain’t behind every lil’ thing like everyone says—he’s only the mastermind for the really dope stuff, not most of what hits humanity. c’mon, there’s only a couple of lit perks in human life and tons of burns, so the good vibes come solely from god, while the evils get their receipts from somewhere else, not him.

he was like, "that’s fact, most true that is."

then we can’t vibe with homer or any other poet who goes full cringe by spitting lines like:

  "lie at the threshold of zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots,"

and that if zeus mixes them,

  "sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;"

but if you get the cup of pure bad juju,

  "him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth."

and again—

  "zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us."

and if some fool claims that breakin' oaths and treaties—which was really pandarus’s move—was actually sparked by athene and zeus, or that all that godly drama was kicked off by themis and zeus, then zero respect, my dude; plus, we ain’t lettin’ our young bros catch aeschylus say, "god plants guilt among men when he’s dead set on wreckin' a house." and if a poet starts dishing on niobe’s sufferin’—from that tragic iambic drop—or on the house of pelops, or on the trojan war, or any similar theme, we either don’t let him claim these are god’s works, or if they are, he’s gotta spin a legit explanation that vibes with our search for truth; he must say god did what was righteous and it only made things more epic by droppin' punishment—but then admit that the punished are straight-up miserable and that god can’t be credited with causin' their misery. the poet is totally blocked from sayin' otherwise; sure, he can note that the wicked get their l's cuz they deserve punishment and might even benefit from that divine hammer drop, but sayin' that god, bein' all good, is behind evil for anyone is a major no-go, and that kind of fake news is suicidal, ruinous, and hella impious.

he was like, "i totally agree, i'm down to sign off on that law."

so let this be one of our core rules when it comes to the gods, fam—our poets and reciters gotta stick to the vibe that god ain't the creator of everything, just the source of pure good.

he was like, "that’s dope, that works."

and what about a second rule? can i ask, do you think god is like a mad magician who pulls shape-shifts outta nowhere—showing up in all kinds of forms, sometimes trickin' us with these epic transformations; or is he one and done, locked into his forever epic original form?

he was like, "bro, i need a sec to vibe on that before i drop an answer."

i replied, "look, if anything's gonna change, it’s either the thing doing its own glow-up or some external force messin' with it, ya feel?"

most definitely, no cap.

and like, stuff vibin' at its peak is the least likely to get wrecked; like, when a human’s at their healthiest and strongest, they ain’t easily messed up by food or drinks, and a plant in full blossom barely gets shook by winds or savage sun heat—that’s just facts, fam.

of course.

and wouldn’t the bravest, wisest soul be totally unbothered by any external bs?

totally true.

and i’m guessing the same rule goes for all composite stuff—furniture, houses, clothes: if they’re on point quality, they basically don’t get wrecked by time or life’s curveballs.

very true, no cap.

so basically, any good thing—whether crafted by artsy hands or natural vibes, or both—is the least likely to be messed up by external forces?

true.

but fr, god and all his divine creations are, like, perfect in every way, right?

of course they are, straight up.

so god can hardly be pushed by any outside bs to flip into different shapes?

he’s not gonna, no way.

but could he, like, decide to glow up or transform himself at all?

clearly, he was like, "if change happens at all, it can only be a self-initiated glow-up."

and if he does switch it up, will it be a major upgrade for beauty or just a downgrade into a rougher look?

if god ever changes, it’d only drop his level—because we can’t honestly think he’s ever been lacking in virtue or that epic beauty, right?

very true, adeimantus; but really, who in their right mind—god or mortal—would wanna downgrade and make themselves worse?

impossible, bro.

so it’s like, god will literally never be down to change, cuz he’s supposed to be the ultimate, most flawless version possible—like every god stays 100% locked in their own epic form forever, no cap.

that straight-up follows logically, he said, in my judgment.

then i said, "my dear friend, no poet should ever be allowed to flex that the gods, sneakin' around in weird stranger disguises, strut through cities in all sorts of random forms;" and no one is gonna trash proteus or thetis, nor should any poet—whether in tragedy or any other vibe—drop lines like someone in priestess cosplay beggin' for alms, sayin', "for the life-givin' daughters of inachus of the argos river;" like, we’re not about that fake hype. also, we can’t let moms influenced by these poets scare their kids with messed-up myth versions—spoutin' that certain gods "roll around at night in random stranger looks and in all kinds of forms;" cuz that only turns our kiddos into scaredy-cats while dissin' the gods.

he was like, "heaven forbid, bro."

but even though gods are totally unchangeable, could it be that through some witchcraft or straight-up deception they trick us into thinkin' they're switchin' forms?

maybe, he replied.

but can you really imagine that god would ever be down to lie, either in words or actions, or even send a phony ghost of himself around?

he was like, "i can’t really say, i’m not feelin' that vibe."

i said, "don't you know that the true lie—if we can even drop that term—is despised by both gods and humans alike?"

he was like, "what you mean by that, bro?"

i meant that no one wants to get their core, real self or their highest truths messed with by a lie; that's the one thing they fear infiltrating their whole being.

still, he said, "i just don’t get what you're on about, bro."

i explained, "look, you're readin' super deep into my words, but i'm just sayin' that deception—being duped about the highest truths in your inner self, your soul, and letting a lie stick there—is what people are most majorly not about; they straight up hate it, like, hardcore."

there’s literally nothing more cringey to them.

and like, as i was sayin', that deep ignorance in someone’s soul once they've been duped is what i'd call the real lie; cuz a lie in words is just a lame imitation—a shadow of a past soulful vibe, not pure, unfiltered falsehood. right?

exactly right.

so the true lie gets downright despised by both gods and dudes, right?

yes.

meanwhile, a lie in words can actually be super useful and not all bad; like when you're dealin' with haters—or when your so-called friends go off in a fit of wild madness and are about to do some harm—then that lie can serve as, like, a remedy or a preemptive fix. also, in those myth vibes we were chattin' about—since the real tea on ancient times is lowkey a mystery, we mash up falsehoods to look as real as possible and turn that to our advantage.

he said, "that's mad true."



but can any of these reasons even apply to god? like, are we supposed to think he’s so clueless about the ancient vibes that he ends up straight-up inventing stuff, no cap?

bruh, that would be totally absurd, he said.

so then, does that mean the lying poet has no spot in our god squad?

i’d say nah.

or maybe he drops a lie just ‘cause he’s shook by haters?

that is totally unthinkable.

but what if he’s rolling with friends who are, like, totally cray or extra?

no way—no mad or senseless person can be down as a friend of god.

so there’s literally zero reason for god to cap?

none whatsoever.

so does that mean our superhuman, divine bae is absolutely incapable of any fake energy?

yaaaass.

so god is, like, perfectly simple and 100% real in word and deed; he never switches up, never yeets anyone with fake vibes—neither by sign nor word, by dream or fully woke vision.

“your thoughts,” he said, “reflect mine.”

you’re on the same page then, i said, that this is the second style in which we should spill the tea about divine things. the gods aren’t no magic chameleons who flip modes on us, nor do they ever ghost humanity with deception.

i vibe with that.

then, even though we stan homer, we’re not here for that lying dream that zeus dished out to agamemnon; and we sure ain’t gonna hype up the verses from aeschylus where thetis claims that apollo at her nuptials

  ‘was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long, and to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. and i thought that the word of phoebus, being divine and full of prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has slain my son.’

these kinds of vibes about the gods are pure trigger material; whoever drops them gets benched from the chorus, and we won’t let teachers use that trash to school the young—‘cause our guardians, as human as they get, need to be 100% real worshippers of the gods, on their level.

i’m totally down with that, he said, and promised to lock it in as his own law.
