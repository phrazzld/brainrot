introduction and analysis.

yo, plato’s republic is literally his longest drop (aside from the laws, obvs) and is straight up the ultimate masterpiece, no cap. sure, his philebus and sophist flex some modern metaphysics vibes, and the politicus (aka statesman) is all about that ideal energy; the laws break down state deets super clearly, and works like the symposium and protagoras? total next-level art, flexin’ excellence. but honestly, no other plato dialogue serves up this massive scope and flawless style—it's like the only one vibin’ with timeless wisdom, packing thoughts that are both old school and brand new for every era.

plato’s got that savage irony, dank humor, and imagery that hits harder than a viral meme, with dramatic power for days. none of his other works blend real life with deep speculation or fuse politics with philosophy like this one does. the republic is the ultimate hub around which all his dialogues vibe; here, philosophy soars to peaks (especially in books v, vi, vii) that ancient thinkers could only dream about.

plato, the original greek brainiac, was the first to cook up a method of knowledge—think of him as the bacon of ancient wisdom. even though neither he nor bacon always separated the mere sketch from the real truth, they were chill with rocking an abstract science that hadn’t dropped yet. big facts: plato was the ultimate metaphysical genius, and his mind was an incubator for next-level knowledge way ahead of its time. the whole shebang of logic and psychology tools we still flex today gets its roots from socrates and plato, legit the og blueprint.

we’re talking principles of definition, smashing contradictions, calling out that sus circular logic, breaking down what’s essential versus extra, means vs. ends, and causes vs. conditions, plus chopping the mind into its rational, lusty, and hotheaded zones (or splitting pleasures into must-have versus extra)—all that epic thought goodness is in the republic, and plato probably invented these ideas first, no cap. and real talk, he stressed the ultimate truth: the major diff between words and actual things, even if he sometimes mixed them up in his own drops. but he wasn’t about locking truth in lame formulas—logic stays draped in that metaphysical drip; his concept of a science that “contemplates all truth and all existence” is a whole different vibe from the syllogism flex that aristotle later claimed to have discovered (soph. elenchi, 33.18).

and don’t sleep on this: the republic is just one third of a mega-plan that was meant to include an ideal history of athens plus a full-on political and physical philosophy remix. the critias fragment spawned a legendary tale, almost as epic as the drama of troy or the legend of arthur, and lowkey even inspired some sixteenth-century navigators. this mythic saga—about the athenians waging wars against the island of atlantis—is thought to be based on an unfinished solon poem, standing in the same relation as how logographers leaned on homer’s poems. it would’ve served up an epic struggle for liberty (see tim. 25c), mirroring the clash between persia and hellas. just peep the noble start in timaeus, the critias fragment itself, and book three of the laws to see how plato would’ve smashed this high-key debate.

we can only speculate why this genius plan got ghosted—maybe plato peeped some major incongruity in his fictional history, lost interest, or simply the advancing years forced him to drop it. but imagine if that epic narrative had been finished—plato himself would’ve been all in on the hellenic independence flex (cp. laws, iii.698 ff.), spitting a victory hymn over marathon and salamis, maybe even dropping herodotus-level wisdom like, “how brave a thing is freedom of speech, making the athenians surpass every other state in hellas!” or, more likely, he’d credit the win to athens’ classic good order and the blessings of apollo and athene (cp. introd. to critias).

furthermore, plato is like the big boss—the “arhchegoz” or captain of a killer squad—since the republic is the original inspo for cicero’s de republica, st. augustine’s city of god, sir thomas more’s utopia, and all those other lit imaginary states riding the same vibe. real talk: aristotle and his crew owe mad props to plato in the politics game—even if aristotle himself never dropped the shoutout. these two philosophers were lowkey on the same wavelength, and some of plato’s juice might still be hidden in aristotle’s lines. even in english philosophy, you can trace plato’s influence in the cambridge platonists as well as in heavy hitters like berkeley or coleridge. the belief that there’s a truth higher than raw experience—one that your mind just feels intrinsically—is a vibe our generation is totally riding, and it’s gaining major ground.

among all the greek authors who sparked a renaissance vibe in the world, plato’s influence is unmatched. his republic is also the first serious guide on education, setting the stage for the legit descendent writings of milton, locke, rousseau, jean paul, and goethe. like dante or bunyan dropped revelations about another life, and like bacon was all about the unity of knowledge, plato’s rep massively shaped early church theology and later lit up political thought during literature’s revival. even when his thoughts were passed around second-hand (symp. 215d), they’ve always had people shook as they saw their own higher nature reflected in them. he’s the papa of idealism in philosophy, politics, and literature, and many modern ideas—like knowledge unity, the reign of law, and gender equality—were already in his visionary dreams.

now, here’s the tea: the republic’s main quest is the hunt for justice. the concept is first casually dropped by cephalus, that righteous, no-drama old timer, then broken down with epic moral pro-tips by socrates and polemarchus, roasted by thrasymachus and partially decoded by socrates, shrunken to abstract form by glaucon and adeimantus, and finally, when justice seems invisible in the individual, it makes a grand comeback in the ideal state socrates builds. the rulers’ top priority? education—crafted according to that classic hellenic model, with a glow-up in religion and morality, simpler vibes in music and gym class, a tougher, manlier spray of poetry, and a harmonious sync between the individual and the state.

this naturally leads to the vision of a higher state where “no man calls anything his own,” where there’s zero marriage drama, and where kings are philosophers and philosophers are kings. in this state, education goes next-level—intellectual, moral, religious, scientific, and artistic—and isn’t just for the young but for life itself. but yo, such an ideal state is practically a unicorn in the real world and quickly degenerates. after the perfect ideal, you get rule by hardcore soldier-types and honor lovers, which then slide into democracy, and eventually democracy flips into tyranny—a fictional yet methodical cycle that doesn’t match real-life tea at all. when “the wheel comes full circle,” we don’t start a fresh era; instead, we drop from the absolute best straight to the worst, and that’s where it all ends.

the convo then switches up to the classic beef between poetry and philosophy—a debate that was only lightly touched on in the earlier books but now gets a full-on showdown. poetry is slotted as an imitation thrice removed from truth, and homer along with other dramatic poets gets benched as mere copycats, sent into banishment along with their crew. meanwhile, the idea of the state gets that extra epic sauce by unveiling the promise of a future life.

the division into books—like all similar splits (cf. sir g.c. lewis in the classical museum, vol. ii. p.1)—is probably a later remix than plato’s original drop. naturally, the work splits into five parts; (1) book i and the first half of book ii, up to the part starting “i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus,” serving as a lit intro. this first section roasts the mainstream, sophistic notions of justice and, like some earlier dialogues, wraps up without a solid conclusion. then it rehashes the common opinion on justice and straight-up asks—what is justice when you strip away all the appearances?

(2) the second section covers the rest of book ii along with books iii and iv, mainly busy with constructing the first state and its foundational education system. (3) the third part consists of books v, vi, and vii, where the deep dive shifts from justice to pure philosophy, building a second state based on communist vibes run by philosopher-kings, with the meditative pursuit of “good” replacing normal social and political virtues. (4) in books viii and ix, the twisted perversions of states and their matching individuals get broken down one after the other, with pleasure and the mechanics of tyranny getting further dissected on a personal level. (5) finally, book x wraps up the whole saga, laying down how philosophy and poetry ultimately relate and crowning the citizens’ assured happiness in this life with a vision of another glorious existence.

alternatively, you can split it into two major parts; the first (books i–iv) describes a state built on classic hellenic vibes of religion and morality, while the second (books v–x) transforms that state into an ideal philosopher kingdom—an ultimate model from which all other governments are just off-brand copies. these two perspectives are total opposites, with the clash only subtly masked by plato’s genius. the republic, like the phaedrus (see introduction to phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the high light of philosophy eventually bursts through the rigid mold of the hellenic temple and vanishes into the heavens.

whether this structural imperfection comes from an expansion of the original plan, from plato’s own struggle to merge clashing ideas in one dope work, or from him writing it over different times—now that’s a question as deep as the iliad vs. odyssey debate: worth pondering, but with no clear answer. in plato’s day, there was zero fixed way of publishing, so an author could switch up or add to a work known only to a few of his buddies without a second thought. it’s totally plausible he took long breaks or bounced between projects—interruptions that are way more likely in a lengthy epic than a short piece. trying to nail down the exact timeline of plato’s writings from internal clues is a hot mess, especially for long works like the republic and the laws compared to the shorter ones. on the flip side, any apparent discrepancies in the republic might just be the clash of different thought streams that plato was trying to fuse into one fire work, even if he couldn’t spot the inconsistencies that we now see crystal clear. later generations drop judgments on his work that few great writers ever managed to foresee—missing links and gaps that only modern peeps can call out. in the early days of literature and philosophy, when thought and language were still getting started, inconsistencies ran wild, unlike now when the paths of speculation are well worn and words come with tight definitions. consistency, like everything else, grows with time; even the sickest creations of the human mind can lack unity. by today’s standards, some of plato’s dialogues look a bit off, but that doesn’t mean they were dropped in separate batches or by different hands. the idea that the republic was written in one continuous creative grind is sort of backed up by all the callbacks scattered throughout.

the alt title “concerning justice” isn’t how the republic was originally dubbed by aristotle or in antiquity—in fact, like most secondary titles on plato’s dialogues, it’s probably a later add-on. morgenstern and others have wondered whether the main flex of the work is defining justice or constructing the state. the real tea is that both vibes merge into one—they’re two sides of the same coin; justice is the order that runs the state, and the state is justice made real in human society. think of it as the soul (justice) and the body (state), with the greek ideal being a perfect mind in a perfect body. in hegelian terms, the state is the real deal that embodies the idea of justice; or, in christian lingo, it’s like saying the kingdom of god is within and then blossoms out into a physical church—a celestial house brought down to earth. or, using a pure plato image, justice and the state are the warp and the woof that give shape to the entire fabric of existence. and when the state’s structure is locked in, the idea of justice never bounces—it reappears, sometimes under a new name, as both the inner law of the soul and as the principle behind rewards and punishments in another life.

virtues are built on justice, with even everyday honesty in trade serving as a mere shadow of that ideal, and justice itself is founded on the idea of good—the ultimate harmony of the world, reflected both in state institutions and in the movements of the heavenly bodies (cp. tim. 47). the timaeus, which zeroes in on the political rather than the ethical side of the republic and is packed with theories about the outer world, still drops mad hints that the same universal law is meant to reign over the state, over nature, and over man.

but yo, both ancient and modern critics have gone off on this question way too hard. there’s a phase in criticism where every work—whether nature or art—is reduced to its design. in ancient writings, and literature in general, there’s always a huge chunk that wasn’t part of the original plan. the plan grows as the author is writing; new ideas hit mid-flow, and he never fully mapped out the argument before diving in. so if you’re hunting for one uber idea that sums up the whole thing, you’re bound to grab the vaguest, broadest vibe. thus, stallbaum—dissatisfied with the basic takes on the republic—claims he’s uncovered the real argument “in the representation of human life in a state perfected by justice and governed according to the idea of good.” while there might be some merit in such broad strokes, they hardly capture the writer’s full blueprint. truth be told, we might as well say there are multiple designs at play instead of one singular plan; nothing gets left out in a masterpiece where the mind naturally links up a wild array of ideas without messing with the overall purpose. what level or type of unity you chase in a building, art, poetry, or prose totally depends on the subject matter. for plato, asking “what was the writer’s intention?” or “what’s the principal argument of the republic?” would’ve been pretty meaningless—and so it’s best yeeted (cp. the introduction to the phaedrus).

yo, isn't the republic basically the ultimate ride for like three or four major truths that plato himself thinks are best repped as the state? just like the jewish prophets dropped mad hints of messiah vibes, the lord's epic day, that suffering servant flex, or even that 'sun of righteousness with healing in his wings'—each serving up those big spiritual ideals for the squad—we get that plato is throwing down his own divine drip on perfection through the greek state: the idea of good is like the blazing sun on our feed; human perfection? that's justice, no cap; education that starts when you're a lil' meme and stays lit as you level up; poets, sophists, and tyrants are all the fake teachers and cringe rulers of humanity; 'the world' is basically the ultimate collage of these vibes; and there's an unreal kingdom that doesn't even exist on earth but is stored up in heaven as the blueprint for human life. like, no masterpiece stays strictly on point—just like when the sun breaks through the clouds and paints every shade of light and dark. every possible filter of truth and made-up drama that masks the real tea is fair game in this philosophical meme fest. it's not all one level; ideas flip from myths to wild fancies, from straight facts to clever wordplay. this ain't just dull prose—it's wild poetry, at least on the major drip—and it should def not be judged by outdated logic or stale history probabilities. plato isn't putting his brain drops together into a neat art collage; nah, they straight up take over him and are just too extra. so, no need to stress whether a state like plato's is actually doable or if the outer package or inner grind hit his mind first—practicality ain't even linked to truth here; his highest flexes are all about the dopest 'design marks'—justice over the state's outer shell, good over justice. the epic science of dialectic, or how he organizes ideas, doesn’t pack real content; it's just the vibe, the method, the spirit for chasing that higher knowledge that every eternal viewer of life is supposed to peep. in books five, six, and seven, plato totally hits the 'summit of speculation'—even though they might not pass the modern thinker test, they're lowkey the most fire and original drops in the whole work.

alright, so we don't gotta go off on that minor tea spill boeckh started about when this convo supposedly went down (like, year 411 b.c. is his random guess, and it's as good as any other flex); after all, a fiction writer—especially one like plato who's notorious for ghosting on chronology (yo, check rep., symp., 193 a, etc.)—is just fishing for overall probability. whether every single homie mentioned in the republic ever vibed together at once isn’t a major glitch for an athens reader 40 years later, or even for plato dropping these dialogues (same as shakespeare with his own plays), so it ain’t a huge mood killer for us now. still, this question might be one of those unsolvable riddles that's still worth asking, bc digging into plato's dates is like trying to meme-solve a mystery; it’s totally pointless to waste time inventing wild reconciliations just to dodge timeline drama—like c.f. hermann's out-there guess that glaucon and adeimantus are not bros but actually plato's uncles (peep apol. 34 a), or stallbaum's wild idea that plato purposely dropped anachronisms as his timestamp trolling in the dialogues.

yo, the main squad in the republic is cephalus, polemarchus, thrasymachus, socrates, glaucon, and adeimantus. cephalus only makes a cameo in the intro, polemarchus bounces at the end of the first debate, and thrasymachus gets totally clapped into silence by the close of book one. the real chat is carried by socrates, glaucon, and adeimantus. in the background, we've also got lysias (the hype orator) and euthydemus—the sons of cephalus and bros of polemarchus—plus a mystery dude, charmantides, who’s just a silent spectator; and then there's cleitophon, who casually drops in like he’s thrasymachus' ride-or-die (he even got his own dialogue, lowkey his extra cameo).

cephalus, the head honcho of the fam, is busy with that proper sacrifice vibe. he's the OG old dude who’s nearly checked out of life, totally at peace with himself and everyone else. he feels like he's sliding closer to the next world and is lowkey stuck on all those past memories. he's super hyped for socrates to drop by, mad about the old poetry classics, feeling blessed from a well-spent life, and stoked to have escaped the wild tyranny of youthful cravings. his love for deep convos, his genuine warmth, his chill about chasing paper—even his constant chit-chat—are all extra interesting. he ain't one of those silent types whose brain is just all about cash; he even admits that having money can keep peeps away from the shady temptations of lying or faking. gotta give props to socrates too, who always serves cephalus mad respect—his own love for dropping questions on anyone, young or old, is totally part of his oracle-assigned mission. like, who else is better to ask the justice Q than cephalus, whose whole life just vibes like justice? his chill take on old age being a totally tolerable phase is iconic, not just for him but for the whole greek spirit—way different from cicero’s over-the-top rants in de senectute. plato paints the twilight years with mad expression using barely any embellishments. as cicero once dropped in (ep. ad attic. iv. 16), old cephalus would’ve been totally outta place in the heavy convo that comes next, since he wouldn’t have even been able to keep up without breaking all kinds of dramatic decorum (yo, check lysimachus in the laches).

now, polemarchus—cephalus' son and heir—is all about that savage youthful candor and impulsiveness; he was even down to hold socrates at gunpoint in the opening act and refuses to let him off when it comes to dissing discussions on women and kids. like cephalus, his view is kinda limited—he vibes with that typical 'rule-your-life by maxims' stage over deeper principles—and he even drops quotes from simonides (peep aristoph. clouds) just like his dad used to rock pindar lines. but TBH, after his initial flex, he runs out of steam; socrates basically has to drag his answers out through heavy-duty dialectic. dude hasn't caught the sophistic drip like glaucon and adeimantus yet, and he’s not even woke to the need to shut them down; his brain is still stuck in the pre-socratic, pre-dialectical era. he’s straight-up incapable of a solid debate and ends up so confused by socrates' savage questions that he barely knows what he's saying. in the end, he's forced to admit that justice is basically a sneaky thief, and that all virtues are just doing a remix of the arts. oh, and from his bro lysias (anti eratosth.) we hear he got wrecked by the thirty tyrants—but no extra tea is spilled about his fate or the whole deal that cephalus and his fam were originally from syracuse and migrated from thurii to athens.

next up, we got thrasymachus—the so-called "chalcedonian giant" we already peeped in the phaedrus—who's the walking meme of sophists in all their worst, extra vibes according to plato. this dude is all vanity and non-stop noise, straight up refusing to drop any wisdom unless he gets paid, always ready with an over-the-top oration to try and dodge socrates’ inevitable fire, but in debates, he’s just a toddler—unable to see that the next savage move is gonna yeet him into silence. he's reached that level where he tosses around vague general ideas, which makes him look ahead of cephalus and polemarchus, but he can’t defend any of it when the convo gets real and ends up just covering his brain farts with lame banter and salty attitude. whether the wild doctrines he’s credited with by plato were even his own drip or just sophistic hearsay is honestly up in the air—back in the early days of philosophy, these moral misfires were all over the place (you see them in thucydides), but we’re here for plato's roast, not the historical receipts. the epic mismatch in this verbal smackdown adds mad humor to the scene. this pompous, empty sophist is totally clapped under the weight of socrates, the ultimate dialectic boss, who knows exactly how to hit that soft spot of vanity and weakness. our boi gets seriously heated by socrates' ironic burns, but his over-the-top, clueless rage only makes him more open to the killer comebacks. when he tries to force-feed his ideas—basically trying to shove his words down everyone's throat—socrates is hit with a straight-up cry of "omg, chill, bro." his mood swings are as extra as his failed arguments. nothing's funnier than watching him completely fold after being thoroughly beat. at first, he tries to stick with the debate half-heartedly, but soon his fake good vibes show up in the form of random comments just to prove he’s still in the game. when glaucon steps in with a savage burn, socrates even protects him with a funny “i've never been your enemy and now i'm your bestie” move. and yo, from cicero, quintilian, and even aristotle’s rhetoric, we know that this utterly ridiculous sophist that plato roasted was actually a real big shot whose writings ended up being preserved for later ages. plus, his contemporary herodicus even played on his name with a line like “thou wast ever bold in battle,” which lowkey shows that plato’s description had some legit truth behind it.

after thrasymachus gets shut down, the two main peeps, glaucon and adeimantus, roll on stage—just like in a greek tragedy (see intro to phaedo), where three actors drop in. at first glance, the two ariston sons might seem like twin memes, kinda like simmias and cebes in the phaedo. but look closer—the similarity fades, and they come off as totally different characters. glaucon is that impulsive, wild youth who just can’t get enough of the game (peep xen. mem. iii. 6); he’s a pleasure-seeking dude, clued in on love’s deep secrets; a true "juvenis qui gaudet canibus," even flexing in the animal-breeding game; a lover of art and music who’s been living that epic young life. he’s quick on the uptake, slicing right beneath thrasymachus’ clumsy dribble to hit the real issues; he exposes the shady underbelly of human life but never loses his belief in what’s just and true. it’s glaucon who grabs the hilariously absurd angle of the philosopher's vibe in the world—a place where being simple is basically "a city of pigs"—always ready with a zinger when the debate lets him, and constantly riding along with socrates’ humor to call out the ridiculous, whether it’s music connoisseurs, theater buffs, or the bizarre antics of democracy’s citizens. his own slip-ups get roasted by socrates multiple times, though socrates won’t let his bro adeimantus get it too deep. glaucon’s like a soldier in the intellectual battlefield, and just like adeimantus, he’s shown off some epic wins at the legendary megara showdown (anno 456? lol). on the flip side, adeimantus comes off deep and heavy, dropping the serious, heavyweight objections. while glaucon is the one lighting up the debate with vibrant energy, adeimantus pushes the convo to a more grown-up, worldly level. in book two, when glaucon insists that justice and injustice should be judged without thinking of consequences, adeimantus fires back that folks only vibe with them for their outcomes; similarly, at the beginning of book four, he throws shade at socrates for not making his citizens happy, only to be told that happiness isn’t the main drop but just a side effect of a dope government. in the chats about religion and myth, adeimantus takes the mic as the main respondent, but then glaucon cracks a cheeky joke and flips the conversation to lighter topics like music and gym class until the book wraps. then, adeimantus comes back with another savage critique of the socratic method and isn’t about letting socrates slide on talking about women and kids. essentially, adeimantus is the heavyweight in the serious debates while glaucon handles the lighter, more creative parts. for instance, in most of book six, they’re deep diving into why philosophy gets so corrupted and what the idea of good really means, with adeimantus leading the charge. glaucon steps back in as the main respondent later on, but sometimes his brain glitches on socrates’ higher-level teachings and he drops some off-target hits. then, adeimantus again nods to his bro glaucon—comparing him to a crazy, contentious state—and in the next book, he steps aside so glaucon can ride the mic all the way to the finish.

so, plato basically flexes a whole lineup of characters that each represent a different stage in the morality game—starting with that classy athens OG gentleman from way back when, followed by the down-to-earth dude who runs his life on old-school proverbs, then the wild, generalizing sophists, and finally the young disciples of the master teacher who know all the sophistic claps but aren’t buying it, instead wanting to dive deeper into the real nature of things. each of these homies—like cephalus, polemarchus, and thrasymachus—is mad distinct. in the republic (and honestly in any of plato’s dialogues), you never see the same character get re-run; every one is a unique vibe.

alright, now let’s spill the tea on socrates’ rep in the republic—it’s kinda all over the place. in book one, we get the real socrates—as seen in xenophon’s memorabilia, the early plato dialogues, and the apology—he’s ironic, savage, always questioning, the OG enemy of the sophists, ready to rock a silenus mask and throw down some serious debate heat. but by book six his beef with the sophists chills out; he’s like, “yo, they’re just reps of the system, not the main baddies.” he shifts into a more dogmatic and constructive mode, moving past the raw political and speculative vibe of the old socrates. in one part, plato even hints it’s time for socrates—after a whole life of deep philosophy—to drop his own hot takes instead of just remixing other dudes’ ideas. there’s zero proof that socrates’ teachings ever really dove into the idea of good or the perfect state, even though he did flex on the universal and final causes (peep xen. mem.; phaedo), and a deep thinker like him, after 30 or 40 years of schooling the masses, would’ve definitely dropped some thoughts on family vibes too (memes got receipts in the memorabilia). the socratic method is still in the game—every inference either lands from his squad or is shown up as a collab discovery between him and his boys—but it’s pretty clear that it’s just a formal vibe that gets kinda tiresome as the chat rolls on. the whole inquiry process turned into a teaching style where the same thesis gets rehashed from all angles, and who better sums that up than glaucon himself, admitting—half-joking—that he ain’t exactly the mvp in these deep dives but can see the real tea and sometimes drop the answer smoother than the rest.

we can’t be 100% sure that socrates was even schooling on the soul’s immortality (his disciple glaucon never caught that in the republic, fyi, cf. apol.), nor is there any reason to think he used out-there myths or divine revelations as his lesson plan, or that he was ready to yeet poetry or trash greek mythology. his signature oath still stands, and there’s a brief shout-out to his daemonium—his internal vibe—which socrates always mentioned as his own unique signal. one major element of socratic teaching that pops off in the republic compared to his other dialogues is the use of examples and illustrations—basically, "let’s test this out with some real-life examples" (τὰ φορτικὰ αὐτῷ προσφέροντες). then adeimantus, with a side of irony in book six, snaps, "yo, you're so not used to vibin' with images." this whole game of dropping examples, which is totally socratic OG, gets super amped by plato into full-on allegories and parables that pack concrete visuals of what’s already been dropped or is about to be unleashed abstractly. like, the cave allegory in book seven is essentially a remix of the knowledge splits from book six; the hybrid animal in book nine is an allegory for the parts of the soul; and the noble captain, his ship, and the true pilot in book six represent the squad dynamic between the people and the philosophers in the state we just peeped. plus, other wild figures—like a random dog, that whole saga of the portionless maiden’s marriage, or the drone-and-wasp crew in books eight and nine—serve as mad connective tissue in these long passages or throw callbacks to earlier chats.

plato totally nails his master’s vibe by calling him "not of this world." with that depiction, the ideal state and all the wild paradoxes in the republic line up perfectly, even though we can’t really say they were socrates’ own speculations. for socrates and other legendary deep teachers—philosophical or religious—when they looked up, the world just came off as a bundle of errors and pure evil. most folks ain’t down with that view, or only half-admit it, and even socrates sometimes catches major crowd shade that turns his deep truths into a mix of ironic pity and weird love. people in general just can’t do philosophy, so they end up beefing with the philosopher; but honestly, they never really get him because they’ve only seen a watered-down, fake version of his ideas—artificial systems that don’t pack any genuine truth, just words that are all over the place. their leaders are clueless about real measure, so they end up not knowing their own worth. these folks are more like memes you laugh at or feel sorry for, not squad members to throw down with; they mean well with their trendy fixes, if only they knew they were basically just chopping off a hydra’s head. that chill, forgiving approach to people being wrong is one of socrates’ most iconic traits in the republic. across all the different casts of socrates—in xenophon, in plato’s own early or later dialogues—he always stays that tireless, disinterested truth seeker, because without that, he wouldn’t even be socrates.

now, switching off the character roast, let's deep-dive into the contents of the republic and then vibe on (1) the overall deets of this hellenic ideal of the state and (2) the modern glow that lets us peep plato's deep thoughts.

book i. the republic kicks off with a straight-up greek vibe—a lit festival in honor of goddess bendis at the piraeus, complete with a promised equestrian torch-race later that night. the whole epic is set to be dropped by socrates the very next day after the bash for a chill crew of critias, timaeus, hermocrates, and another homie – all deets we snag from the opening bars of timaeus.

once socrates flexes the mic and nabs that rhetorical clout, he ain’t trippin’ about the audience or reminding us that this convo is longer than your longest netflix binge. out of the whole squad, only three peeps are here for the deep debate; and honestly, we never get the tea on whether they hit up the torch-race later or stayed up all night dissing life like in the symposium. the scene goes like this: socrates and his boy glaucon are about to yeet from the festival when they catch a DM from polemarchus, who slides in fast with adeimantus – glaucon’s bro – and with playful force basically drags them to stick around. he promises not just the torch-race but also some next-level convo with the young guns, which for socrates is a way bigger flex than any race. they cruise back to the crib of cephalus, polemarchus’ old-school dad, who’s chilling on a plush throne prepped for sacrifice. “yo, socrates, you should hit me up more often ‘cause i’m too old to bounce over to you; at this stage, having lost most of the usual fun, i’m all about that deep talk.” 

socrates then asks cephalus for his two cents on aging, and the old dude drops that all the drama and feels of growing old come from human temper tantrums – that age is basically a peace mode where the crazy passions chill out. true that, socrates agrees, but then he goes, “but the squad out there will be like, ‘cephalus, you’re living your best life in old age ‘cause you’re loaded.’” cephalus fires back, “facts, socrates, but not as extra as people think – kinda like themistocles dissed the seriphian saying, ‘neither you, if you were an athenian, nor i, if i were a seriphian, would ever be famous,’ so i’d say, neither a baller broke dude can ever be happy in his later years, nor a lame rich dude.” socrates peeps that cephalus is not sweating riches – a vibe he chalks up to inheriting stacks rather than hustling for ‘em – and he’s like, “alright then, what’s the major flex of being rich?” cephalus responds that when you hit that old age level, the belief in a next-level world starts growing on you, and having done right without ever being forced to do wrong (or lying to anyone) is nothing short of epic blessings. clearly warming up for a debate sesh, socrates then pops the million-dollar question: what’s the real meaning of justice? is it just all about speaking truth and paying up your debts – that’s it? or are there wiggle room exceptions? like, should i, say, return a sword to my friend who’s gone full cray after i borrowed it when he was chill? “there’s gotta be exceptions,” the old man concedes. “and yet,” adds polemarchus, “the definition we got carries the weight of simonides’ word.” at that point, cephalus dips out to handle the sacrifices, and as socrates jokes, he passes the argument mic over to his heir, polemarchus.

the old age saga wraps up, and plato then drops the bomb by sliding into the heavy question of justice – essentially setting up the quest that glaucon later rides to debate external gains, while also lowkey hinting at that underworld myth from cephalus. the pic of the just man serves as the natural intro trailer for the epic debate that’s about to go down – almost like saying that in all our brainfarts about what justice even is, spotting “a just dude” ain’t rocket science. the first drop was backed up by a simonides quote; now socrates is itching to show that chopping justice into two random, unlinked bits just ain’t cutting it on a dialectic level.

next up, socrates goes off: what was simonides really throwin’ down with that line? did he mean i should literally return arms to a friend if he’s lost his marbles? “nah fam, not if the squad’s tight and bad vibes would get thrown around. he meant you gotta do what’s proper – dish out the good for your friends and the bad for your enemies.” every move has a ripple, right? so socrates asks, what’s the dope thing that justice actually does and for who? the reply: justice is all about boosting your friends and throwing mad shade at your haters. but then, in what flavor? “by linking up with the homies and going to war with the foes.” so then, in chill times, what’s the perk of justice? it’s clutch in contracts and money deals – like, justice is the ultimate backup when your cash is just sitting there doing nothing. but wait, there's more: justice, like war tactics or any solid skill, has gotta flex on both offense and defense – killer at heisting as well as guarding. and then, boom, justice gets dubbed a thief – but like, an absolute legend thief, channeling autolycus the original homeric bad boy who was “next-level in heists and perjury” – thanks, homer and simonides, for that wild ride; though of course, the thievery is only legit when it’s to bless your crew and wreck your enemies. then another twist comes: are our friends and enemies the real deal or just fake vibes? and should our friends only be the truly good and our enemies totally bad? the lowdown is, we gotta do good for both our actual and seeming good peeps, and throw down harm on both our actual and faux bad ones – good vibes for the good, and bad vibes for the baddies. but seriously, should we ever repay evil with evil if that just turns people extra villainous? can justice even spawn injustice any more than horsemanship turns riders into noobs or heat magically makes things ice cold? the final bombshell: no wise dude or legendary poet ever said the just give back evil for evil; that was just a motto from some bougie overlord – like periander, perdiccas, or ismenias the theban (around bc 398-381).

so the first round of all-that aphoristic, half-awake morality gets shown to be totally not cutting it for the age; the poets’ fame gets yeeted aside, and as we meander through the mazes of dialectic, we edge closer to that next-level christian vibe of forgiving haters. the persian mystic poet even drops similar bars when his inner questioning gets lit: “if i do bad and you hit me with bad, then what’s the diff between you and me?” in that move, both plato and khayyam rise above a bunch of christian (?) theologizers. the basic take on justice slides smoothly into the next remix; like swapping out the simple “speak truth and pay your debts” for the more abstract “do good for your friends and wreck for your enemies.” either version drops enough life hacks for the average joe, but neither nails it with the precision of philosophy. by the way, casuistry – that old-school art of moral debate – not only popped up from clashing principles in specific deets, but also from the grind to nail them down, coming before and after our core moral ideas. the whole “interrogation” of moral vibes; flexing homer’s authority; and concluding that the motto “do good for your friends and wreck for your enemies” is off, couldn’t have been spitted by any true legend – that’s peak platonic socrates energy.

…then out of nowhere, thrasymachus – who’d been tryna jump in several times but got kept on a short leash by the crew – finally pounces during a pause, bursting into the ring like a wild beast with a full-on roar. “socrates,” he bellows, “what kinda clownery is this? why y’all letting each other get wrecked in this fake debate?” then he shuts down all the standard definitions of justice; socrates fires back that he can’t even figure out how many twelve is if he’s banned from saying 2 x 6, or 3 x 4, or 6 x 2, or 4 x 3. initially, thrasymachus is all like “nah, i’m not about that life,” but eventually, with promises of coin and a pat on the back from socrates, he dives in. “listen up,” he spits, “my answer: might is right, justice is just the interest of the stronger. now, throw me some props.” socrates is like, “hold up, lemme break it down. are you saying that because polydamas the wrestler, who’s way stronger than us, digs beef-eating for his own gain, that eating beef is also our jam even though we’re a bunch of softies?” thrasymachus flips out at that, and with pompous flair trying to restore some class, he explains that the rulers (the strong ones) make laws just for their own gain. but then socrates drops a curveball: what if the boss level flops and makes a mistake—then the so-called interest of the strong isn’t really theirs. thrasymachus nearly gets roasted by this burn, but his sidekick cleitophon swoops in and casually slips in the word “thinks”—like not the actual interest of the ruler, but what he believes (or thinks) his interest is, that becomes justice. the wordplay lets him slide past the contradiction: even if the ruler’s real and apparent interests don’t match, what he personally vibes as his interest stays his vibe.

now, of course, this wasn’t his original drop, and thrasymachus himself isn’t fully on board with the remix. but socrates isn’t tryna get into pointless word fights—if, as he hints, his opponent’s already switched lanes. soon enough, thrasymachus ditches his earlier admit that a ruler might mess up, and insists that a ruler, by definition, is infallible. socrates is down to roll with the new stance, and then fires back using his fave arts analogy. every art or science has its own vibe or interest, but that is totally different from lucky, incidental perks the artist might grab—it’s all about what’s best for the work or the peeps that come under that art. and justice’s vibe isn’t about boosting the ruler or judge’s own rep, but about what’s best for the squad under their reign.

just as thrasymachus is nearing his inevitable finale, he pulls a wild sidestep. “tell me, socrates,” he blurts, “you got a nurse?” like, fr, what? why even ask that? “‘cause if you do, she’s probably ghosting you, letting you spout nonsense all over town, and she never even schooled you on telling a shepherd from his sheep. you’re trippin’ that shepherds and rulers are always thinking about their squad’s vibe, not their own, when really they’re just fattening up both for their own use. and the receipts are clear: in every life deal, the just dude ends up taking L’s while the unjust is raking in wins—especially when it comes to mega injustice, which is a whole other ball game compared to the petty hustles of scammers, burglars, and temple robbers. the way people chat—our so-called “gracious” and “blessed” tyrants and the like—basically shows (1) that justice is just the interest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is both way more profitable and way stronger than justice.”

thrasymachus, who’s better at big speeches than deep debates, having drenched the room in his words, starts planning an exit. but the crew ain’t havin’ it, and socrates throws in a humble yet fiery request that he stick around instead of bailing when things go south. “and what more can i do for you?” he asks; “you want me to plant these words deep into your souls?” “god forbid!” fires socrates, “but we need you to be consistent, not switching from calling someone a ‘physician’ in a strict sense to a loose ‘shepherd’ or ‘ruler’ in another—if we’re being literal, a ruler and a shepherd are all about the good of their peeps or flocks, not their own clout. yet you’re out here insisting that rulers are just hyped by office-love.” “no doubt about it,” fires back thrasymachus. “then why are they even paid? isn’t it because their own interest isn’t wrapped up in their art, so it falls under another art—the art of pay, which is common to all arts and, therefore, not identical with any one of them? and honestly, no dude becomes a ruler unless he’s vibing with the hope of mad rewards or scared stiff of punishment—the rewards are coin or clout, and the punishment is having to get ruled by someone even wackier than him. and if a state (or church) was stacked only with good dudes, they’d all be on that last motive; there’d be as many “nolo episcopari” vibes as there are now from the opposite side…”

the roast on current governments gets even danker thanks to the slick and almost offhand way that last remark drops. there’s a similar savage twist in the argument that the bosses of mankind are lowkey not into holding office, and that’s why they demand mad pay.

…alright, enough tea on that: thrasymachus’ next bomb is even juicier—that living the unjust life is hella more lucrative than being straight-up just. now, since you and i, glaucon, ain’t buying his drip, we gotta clap back; but if we try to stack their gains against each other, we’d need a judge to call the plays—so it’s better to swap mutual nods of truth.

thrasymachus had been flexing that pure, no-holds-barred injustice is more profitable than pure justice, and after a bit of hesitation, socrates coaxes him into dropping the even wilder paradox that injustice is actually virtue and justice is straight-up vice. socrates gives props for his candid realness and rocks the vibe of a dude who just wants to truly understand his opponents, all while slowly weaving a net that eventually traps thrasymachus. the poor guy ends up admitting that the just dude only aims to snag an edge over the unjust, not over someone who’s also just, while the unjust is out here trying to one-up literally anyone. to test this claim, socrates busts out his fav analogy about the arts again: think of a musician, doctor, or any dope artist—they don’t hustle to beat every other skilled homie, just to outshine the noobs (i.e., they stick to a rule, a standard, a law, and don’t go extra), while the unskilled just ends up going random overboard. so, the skilled land on team good, and the unskilled get stuck on team evil—and by that logic, the just is like the master artist, and the unjust is a total amateur.

it took some serious grind to nail thrasymachus down to this point; the day was blazing hot, and he was sweating buckets – for the first time ever, he even turned a deep shade of red. but his other big claim – that injustice is stronger than justice – still hadn’t been yeeted, so socrates moves on to break that down further with help from thrasymachus. at first, thrasymachus is all gruff and snarky, but socrates’ chill finesse soon gets him back on track: isn’t there some honor even among thieves? isn’t the raw strength of injustice really just a leftover echo of justice? isn’t full-blown injustice basically the same as mega weakness? like, a house split in two is doomed, two dudes bickering totally drain each other’s power, and someone fighting with himself is basically at war with both himself and the gods. so, it ain’t full-on wickedness that thrives in states, but only a half-wicked vibe – you need a sprinkle of the good left over to make squad unity possible – there’s no full kingdom of evil on this planet.

another major q drops: is the just dude or the unjust dude living the happiest life? to that, we hit back that every art comes with its own endgame and excellence—its own vibe that gets the goal done. and isn’t the soul’s endgame pure happiness, with justice being that secret sauce (the excellence) that makes happiness happen? once you lock justice and happiness as ride-or-die partners, the whole debate over whether the just or the unjust are winning fades out.

thrasymachus then snaps, “let this be your entertainment, socrates, at the festival of bendis.” and yeah, that’s some primo entertainment, especially since you’ve finally chilled on the scolding. but still, it wasn’t top-tier fun—and that’s on me ‘cause i sampled too many flavors. we started with the lowdown on what justice even is, then whether justice rocks as virtue and wisdom or if it’s just evil and madness; then we hit up the pros and cons of being just versus being unjust—and the grand takeaway is that i’m still like, what the heck is justice? so how am i supposed to know if the just truly live their best life or not?…

thus, the sophistry setup gets straight-up demolished, mainly by dropping the arts analogy. “justice is like the arts (1) in that it doesn’t chase after extra, external perks, (2) it’s never about going overboard, and (3) justice is to happiness what a craftsman’s tool is to his work.” now, a modern head might trip over this ‘cause plato was spitting these bars back when arts, virtues, and even moral and brainy faculties were all kind of mixed up. early thinkers used the arts to fill that thinking void; and at first, matching up the arts and virtues wasn’t seen as bogus – they only peeped the similarities, not the differences. virtue, like art, bridges the means to an end; good manners are both an art and a virtue; character naturally gets pictured like a classic statue; and plenty of other figure-of-speech moves slide smooth from art into morals. later generations sorted out these confusions – or at least took centuries to break them down further. plato’s crew was in deep transition mode, not yet fully vibing with aristotle’s everyday diff that “virtue is about action, art is about production” (nic. eth.), or that “virtue means having true intent and sticking to it,” while “art is just about know-how.” and yet, in some of the absurd falls from this analogy, you catch a hint that virtue’s something extra compared to art. this is clear in the reductio ad absurdum that “justice is a thief,” and in socrates’ total discontent with that final, whack outcome.

the phrase “an art of pay,” described as “common to all the arts,” isn’t really how we usually drop language. nor does it pop up anywhere else from plato or any other greek wordsmith. it’s basically hinted at by the argument, stretching the idea of art to doing as well as making. another little language glitch shows up in the bit “men who are injured are made more unjust.” ‘cause folks who get hurt aren’t necessarily turned into full-on villains—they’re just harmed or treated badly.

the second of the three arguments – “that the just does not aim at excess” – actually packs some real meaning, even though it’s wrapped in mad cryptic vibes. the notion that “good” is naturally finite is a hella classic helenic mood, kinda like modern peeps talking about virtue as being “fit” and freedom as sticking to the rules. the mathematical or logical idea of a limit slides over into ethics pretty smooth, even spilling into myth when talking about envy (greek-style). ideas about measure, equality, order, unity, proportion – they still echo through moral treatises; and the true spirit of the fine arts hits harder with these no-nonsense terms than with overblown superlatives.

“when workmen hustle to do better than just alright, they end up mixing up their skill with straight-up greed.” (king john. act. iv. sc. 2.)

the harmony between soul and body, and between all parts of the soul itself – a harmony that’s even fresher than a killer beat – is the ultimate helenic way of picturing human perfection.

in what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with thrasymachus, plato is like, “yo, check it: evil ain’t about flexing strength—it’s all about causing chaotic beef and self-destruct mode.” he lowkey slides into that age-old debate that modern theologians and philosophers keep lowkey roasting—the whole negative, sus energy of evil. in his final diss, we catch the first spark of that aristotelian concept: there’s a major endgame and a virtue that’s totally tuned to that endgame, a vibe that even the arts are hyping. ultimately, plato hints that justice and happiness are literally squad goals, and that the individual and the state are basically one tight-as-hell crew. socrates, back in his signature “i know nothing, fam” style, reenters while still throwing some major side-eye at how the whole convo was run. nothing gets fully wrapped up; but the whole back-and-forth is meant to level up our idea bank and stretch their usage out to real-life grind.

book ii. thrasymachus got chilled out, but the bold af glaucon is not about to let the convo end. he’s totally over socrates’ indirect fade-out on the “is the just or the unjust living that lit life” debate from the previous chapter. first, glaucon splits all the goodies into three vibes: one, goods that are fire just for being themselves; two, goods that are both independently fresh and score mad results; and three, goods that are only on point for their clout later. then he slides into socrates’ DMs, asking, “yo, where you slotting justice in this lineup?” socrates fires back that it’s in the second squad—the double-threat of goods that are desirable in themselves and for what they pull later. “but then, the whole world is out here with another story, saying justice is part of that sketchy tier where things are only fun for the after-party,” he adds. socrates claps back that this whole narrative is just thrasymachus’ weak sauce, which he straight-up rejects. glaucon is like, “bet, thrasymachus was way too busy vibing with some smooth talker,” so he proposes a deep-dive into the raw, unfiltered nature and roots of justice and its gnarly counterpart, injustice, independent of all those clout-chasing rewards the world keeps blaring. first up, he’s gonna break down how justice pops off in the first place; second, he’ll show how people treat justice as a necessary move rather than an actual flex; and third, he’s here to prove why that mindset is totally on point.

‘doing injustice is hailed as a flex while catching injustice is a massive L. since life keeps proving that the whole bad vibe is way more epic than the good, the ones getting rekt—and who can’t be the OG wrongdoers themselves—band together and decide they want none of it, and this squad goal or “mean” is what we call justice, which is really just the mission impossible of pulling off a bad move. nobody would sign up for such a pact if they weren’t forced to, no cap. now, imagine if both the just and the unjust had magic rings like gyges from that legendary tale, making them invisible—then everybody would just yeet into evil mode if they could, and no difference would ever show. and the dude who holds back on the bad vibes? the world would label him a total simp for his effort. sure, some might publicly praise him out of self-preservation, but behind closed screens, they’d lowkey be snickering. (cp. gorgias)

‘now let’s sketch out an ideal drip of the just versus the unjust. picture the unjust homie as the master of his hustle—barely messing up and quick to glitch-fix his errors; loaded with coin stacks, smooth talk, and flex-worthy strength—the ultimate villain repping top-tier character; and next to him, imagine the just dude, keeping it 100 with genuine nobility and chill simplicity—being, not just looking like, a stand-up guy without a tag or reward—rocking nothing but raw justice—basically the best of the squad even if people think he’s the ultimate underdog—letting him dip exactly as he’s always been. i could add (but honestly, i’d rather let the self-proclaimed panegyrists of injustice spill the rest of the tea) that the just dude will get totally wrecked, tortured, chained up, have his eyes yeeted out, and ultimately be crucified (like seriously impaled)—all because he should’ve been down with the look rather than the actual grind. now, peep the wild diff with the unjust who’s all about that appearance as the real flex! his high-key character makes him a boss; he can snatch a wife however he wants, trade on his own terms, boost his homies and wreck his haters; having stacked cash through shady moves, he can even pray to the gods with extra clout, thus earning more divine love than the just ever will.

i was thinking about what to clap back when adeimantus jumped into this already chaotic fray. he straight-up pointed out that the biggest tea was missing: “folks get taught to be just solely for the rewards, no cap; parents and guardians pump up reputation as the ultimate incentive for virtue. and then they promise hella other perks—like baller marriages and top-tier positions. think about homer and hesiod’s visuals: fat sheep, plush fleeces, hella rich cornfields, and fruit trees dropping like confetti—these are like the gods’ sponsored gift packs in this lifetime for the just. and the orphic poets hype up a similar vision: the musaeus and eumolpus heroes chill on couches at bomb festivals, rocking garlands on their doms, enjoying that eternal tipsy paradise as the final reward for virtue. some even level up and drop hints of a dope legacy in the third and fourth gens. but then, the wackos get dumped in sludge and are forced to haul water in a busted sieve; and in this life, they hit them with the stigma that glaucon was already dishing out as the destiny for the just who are presumed to be, like, totally unjust.”

‘check this next-level argument you see in both vibe poetry and straight-up prose:— “virtue,” as hesiod declares, “is hella honorable but mad difficult to score, while vice is easy and mad lucrative.” you often see the wicked padding their wallets big time while the righteous are getting clapped by fate. and then those low-key prophet types come knocking on rich dudes’ doorsteps, promising to atone for their sins (or even their dad’s sins) with low-key sacrifices and lit parties, or with charms and invocations to ghost an enemy—good or bad—with divine backup for a bargain; they even flex books they claim were dropped by musaeus and orpheus, capturing entire cities' minds, promising to “rescue souls from purgatory;” and if we decide to block their track, who knows what next-level drama might hit us.

‘so when a fresh-minded, unjaded youth hears all these wild stories, what’s his final verdict? he wonders, “yo, am i gonna build justice as my ultimate fortress, or am i just gonna stack up on sketchy, crooked deceit?” he figures that justice without that lit look is nothing but pure misery and epic wipeouts; injustice, on the flip, comes with the promise of a mega, glitzy life. looks basically run the show, ruling truth and happiness. so i’m pivoting to the world of appearances—i’m gonna put on that virtuous cosplay and tag along with the sly fox vibe from archilochus. i catch someone saying, “wickedness ain’t easy to mask,” and i’m like, “bro, nothing legendary is ever easy.” unity, grind, and fire rhetoric will move mountains; and even if peeps say they can’t outsmart the gods, then how we even know gods exist? it’s all straight outta the poets, who admit they might be soothed by sacrifices. so why not sin hard and then drop some coins for indulgences? ‘cause if the righteous end up just dodging punishments, they ain’t really scoring extra rewards, while the wicked might dodge the Ls and still enjoy the sin life. but what about that underworld grind? nah, the argument goes, there are cosmic atonement forces out there, as the poets (the legit offspring of the gods) confess; and the state totally gives that a thumbs-up.

‘how the heck are we supposed to resist these hype arguments in favor of injustice? just throw in some proper manners, and, as the wise ones say, we legit get the best of both worlds. who, being anything but a total simp, wouldn’t crack a smile hearing all that justice praise? even if a dude knows the ultimate truth, he won’t be throwing shade at others; ‘cause he knows saving a man takes more than just superficial virtue, and only a dude incapable of pulling off a bad move would be hyping justice just for the clout.

‘the origin of all this evil drama is that ever since day one, the epic heroes, the poetic legends, and the youth mentors have been on that “temporary flex” mission—pushing that the here-and-now honors and gains of justice are the real trophies. if we’d been schooled from our early days about the raw power of justice and its sneaky counterpart, hidden from every human or divine lens, we wouldn’t have needed a bouncer to guard us—everyone would be their own personal gatekeeper. and that’s exactly what i need you to bring to the table, socrates;—while other dudes are spouting arguments that basically amp up thrasymachus’ “might is right” vibe, i expect you to drop something way more epic. and yo, as glaucon already said, drop the whole rep game; let the just be seen as the unjust and the unjust as the just, and still show us that justice is the ultimate glow-up.

the thesis that glaucon is rocking for the sake of argument is basically the flip side of thrasymachus’—it’s not that the strong get all the perks, but that “right” is really about the necessity of the underdogs. starting from the same base, he breaks down society even further;—might is still in play, but now it’s like the weak masses teaming up to bring down the few power players.

modern and ancient brainiacs have both dropped theories that vibe with glaucon’s speculations; like, power is the foundation of right, or that a monarch’s divine right lets him rule whether he’s chill or chaotic; or that virtue is just self-love or a hunger for power; or that war is mankind’s natural state; or that personal vices somehow flip into public gains. all these theories carry some street cred because they partially vibe with experience. human nature is a wild seesaw between good and evil, and the motives behind actions and the origins of our institutions can be played out on either side, depending on a thinker’s angle. the urge to flex authority no matter what, sometimes using sus means, is super strong and feels like an instinct among civilized peeps. the divine right of kings—or more broadly, governments—is just one flashy frame for that natural vibe. and honestly, no evil drops without a side of pleasure; no good move comes without a sprinkle of evil; and no noble thought is served without a side of self-interest. we all know human actions are imperfect; but that doesn’t mean we chalk them up to the worst motives instead of the better vibes. such clout-chasing philosophies are both straight-up ridiculous and bogus, like that clever rogue who pegs everyone as his mirror image. and these theories don’t even capture the true essence of the state, which is built on a fuzzy sense of rightness that’s slowly refined and leveled up by custom and law (even though it can still get perverted), any more than they nail down the start of society, which is locked down in the family vibe and in the social and spiritual feels of mankind. nor do they capture the typical character of individuals, which can’t just be boiled down to a theory of evil, but always has a counteracting dose of good. and as people level up, these theories start to feel more and more off, because folks become way more woke about their own selfless vibes. a little life experience might turn a dude into a cynic; but a massive glow-up will bring him back to a more real and kind view of the mixed-up nature of himself and his squad.

the two bros then ask socrates to prove that the just are still on that happy grind even after you jack all the usual happiness loot from them. not that it’s cray to try and build a concept of justice separate from everyday struggles—’cause the peak ideal is always gonna be a wild paradox compared to our basic human condition. neither the stoical ideal nor the christian dream is ever literally real, but they still serve as a foundation for schooling and can totally upgrade your vibe. an ideal doesn’t get any less epic just because some genius discovered that no one ever actually nails that perfect flex. and in a few rare homies who level up above the usual human scale, that happiness ideal might actually drop in death or even in extreme misery. this might just be the state that reason intentionally vibes with, and one that utilitarians and every other moral nerd might, in some rare cases, lowkey prefer.

and also, we can’t forget that even though plato is generally down with the bros’ take, he isn’t dropping his own final verdict here—he’s just showing off one aspect of ethical truth to the max. he’s building his idea step-by-step in different positions and scenarios. he’s even putting socrates through the classic socratic grill for the first time. lastly, the term “happiness” gets a bit sus because modern philosophy ties it to that conscious high of pleasure or contentment, which wasn’t exactly in his playbook.

glaucon had been sketching a vibe of epic pain for the just and a baller life for the unjust, with the tyrant’s wreck in book ix serving as the dope counter-response and mirror. and still, the unjust have to come off as just; that’s like “the homage vice pays to virtue.” but now adeimantus, picking up on the hint glaucon dropped, rolls in to show that according to the masses, justice is only about chasing rewards and rep, and he points out that thrasymachus and glaucon’s arguments get mad boost from the normie moral code. he’s lowkey feeling the struggle of “justifying the ways of god to man.” both bros end up tagging the question of whether an action’s morality is judged by its consequences; and both go way past socrates’ position that justice is sorted among goods that are not only inherently lit but also score later flex, which he keeps on repeating. in their hustle to view justice as an inner drive, and by dissing the poets, they’re lowkey setting the stage for socrates. the typical greek life just doesn’t cut it for them; they need to deep-dive into the nature of all things.

some peeps say that justice is basically honesty in glaucon and adeimantus’ retort, but socrates takes it to mean all forms of virtue. maybe we should say that the old-school vibe of justice just gets leveled up by socrates, morphing into a universal order or overall well-being—first in the state and then in the individual. he’s dropped a fresh answer to his old debate (protag.), “are the virtues a squad or just one kingpin?” namely, that one serves as the organizing principle for the other three. in his quest to nail down the strictly inner nature of justice, he bumps into the fact that humans are social creatures, and he tries to remix these two conflicting ideas as best as he can. there’s no more inconsistency here than what was totally unavoidable in his day and territory; there’s zero point in swinging modern philosophy’s harsh crosshairs at him, since from another angle, his vibes would seem just as mismatched. plato isn’t here handing us the final solution to all philosophical tea; you can’t really judge him by our modern playbook.

the rest of the republic rolls out from the question of the sons of ariston. three major points drop immediately: first, socrates’ answer is totally indirect. he never straight-up claims that happiness is all about vibing with the idea of justice, and he sure as heck isn’t gonna buy into that stoical paradox that a just dude can be happy while getting tortured on the rack. instead, he first hypes up the struggle of the issue, insisting on getting man back to his natural, unfiltered state before dropping any answers. he too will sketch an ideal, but his isn’t just an abstract justice—it’s the whole squad dynamic. thanks to that flashy illustration in huge letters, he’s implying that he’s only gonna hunt for justice in society first, and then from the state, he’ll zoom into the individual. essentially, his answer boils down to this: under the perfect conditions—in the ultimate state—justice and happiness are bestie goals, and once justice is locked in, happiness will just ride along. sure, he might slip into some inconsistency when in book x he claims to have yeeted the rewards and rep of justice, but that only applies to those outside the perfect state. and the philosopher “who chills under the shelter of a wall” probably isn’t what he’d call happy in this life. still, he holds down the realest moral hustle. let a dude do his duty first, without stressing whether he’ll get lit or not, and watch as happiness naturally tags along as the inseparable bonus. “seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”

second, it’s worth dropping that plato keeps it 100 with genuine greek thought by kicking off with the state before zooming in on the individual. first ethics, then politics—that’s how we roll with ideas; history flips that script. only after a wild struggle of thought does the individual step up and claim his moral rights. back in the day, he wasn’t a solo act but just one player in a larger state squad that came first; and he had no real sense of good or evil outside the law of his crib or the creed of his church. and whenever the influence of tradition, party vibes, or old school memories hits hard, he keeps sliding back to that collective mode.

third, we gotta peep the blur between the individual and the state, between ethics and politics—a vibe that early greek thinkers were deep into and that still manages to drop influence today. the subtle diff between collective and solo action sometimes flew over early peeps’ heads, and we’re equally at risk of forgetting those squad conditions whenever we either boost politics into ethics or downgrade ethics to plain old politics. the good bro and the good citizen only truly vibe alike in the perfect state; and that perfection can’t be hit by outside laws—it has to be molded from the inside through education.

...socrates throws mad props to the sons of ariston, calling them “inspired offspring of the renowned hero,” as the elegiac poet would drop, but he’s totally baffled at how these dudes can spit so eloquently in favor of injustice while their own character stays unbothered by their arguments. he’s lowkey stumped on how to clap back, even though he’s shook at the thought of ditching justice when the pressure’s on. so he sets a condition: since his eyes are kinda on weak mode, he demands to peep the giant letters first before he dives into the small print—that is, he’s gonna hunt justice in the state first, and only then zoom in on the individual. with that order set, he starts piecing together the state.

society be poppin’ off from man’s basic needs, no cap. first up, fam craves some legit grub; sec, they need a dope crib; and third, they’re all about that fresh drip—a bomb coat. the mad realization of these needs plus the ability to swap ‘em got peeps converging in one spot—boom, that’s the OG drop of a state, which we lowkey invented even though necessity was the real mvp behind the whole flex.

you gotta have a farmer for the produce, a builder to craft that epic pad, a weaver to stitch the vibes, and you can toss in a cobbler for extra clout. basically, you need like four or five squad members to even call it a city. but yo, every dude’s got his own drip, and one legend can slay a task way better than a whole crew—and hustle waits for no one, fr.

so we’re forced to split the work into lit gigs: wholesale and retail trade, blue-collar workers and tool-makers, shepherds and hustling farmers. a city stacking all these roles will easily go beyond a four-or-five peep club, though it might still be kinda cozy. then again, you need imports, which call for exports and a variety of swag to keep buyers vibin’, plus merchants and ships to ship it out.

in our state-crucial crib, we gotta have a market, money flow, and retail hustlers; otherwise, buyers and sellers ghost each other and producers end up wasting that prime time on lame exchanges. throw in some hired servants to complete the state setup, and obviously, in the squad’s constant interactions, both justice and injustice are gonna slide into the convo.

check this rustic flex of life: they’re chillin’ in houses they built themselves, whipping up their own threads while growing their own corn and wine—total self-sufficiency, bet. their main munchies are meal and flour, and they keep the drink game moderate. everyone’s vibing on chill terms and careful not to max out on kiddos. 

“but,” drops glaucon, sliding in, “ain’t they supposed to have some flavor?” 

fo sho; they’re gonna have salt, olives, cheese, fresh veggies, fruits, and even chestnuts to roast over a fire. 

“a city of pigs, socrates,” he snaps. 

i hit back, “yo, what more you tryna cop?” 

“just the deluxe life, bro—sofas, tables, epic sauces, and a stash of sweets.” 

i see; you ain’t just after a basic state, but a luxe state—where maybe in that extra extra complex remix, justice and injustice show up faster.

then the fine arts gotta grind—every possible instrument and bling of luxury is on deck. expect dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, chefs, barbers, tire-women, nurses, and art bosses; even animal peeps like swineherds and neatherds to look after the squad’s critters, plus docs to mend the glitches luxury sometimes brings. 

to feed all these extra mouths, we’re gonna need a slice of our neighbor’s turf, and they’ll be eyeing a piece of our pie too. and that, my dudes, is the real tea on why war pops off—same sus roots as all those politic nightmares. our city will soon need a camp setup, converting citizens into soldiers; yet our OG division of labor vibes still holds strong.

war ain’t a one-day bio—only peeps with that natural savage aptitude can vibe on military duties. there’ll be some straight-up beast modes, like dogs with killer sniffs, mad quick feet for the chase, and built like tanks to throw down. since spirit is the ultimate fuel for courage, these wild souls, whether legends or literal dogs, are full of that high-key energy. 

but yo, these hype creatures might end up biting each other—being soft with your crew and savage with your haters seems like an impossible mashup, and the state’s guardian gotta rock both vibes. so who can be the ultimate guardian? think about a dog—cuddly with homies, fierce on strangers. your dog is basically a philosopher judging who’s clued in or not; and deep thinking, whether in man or beast, breeds that mellow, gentle fire. our human watchdogs gotta be brainiac vibes or straight-up learning junkies to keep it chill. and how else will they level up without proper edu?

but what should their edu be? any version better than the old-school kind we call music and gymnastics? since music’s packed with literature—which comes in two flavors: real talk and straight-up cap. 

“what you sayin’?” one asks. 

i mean, kids get hit with stories before they even flex in gym class, and those tales are either pure fake news or got one or two legit pixels of truth hidden in a bushel of bogus. early on, minds are mad impressionable—kids shouldn’t catch that trash they’ll later have to unlearn; so we gotta run some next-level censorship on nursery tales, dumping some and keeping others. 

some stories are extra sketchy—like those major whack tales from homer and hesiod, not just any lies, but major cap about uranus and saturn, which come off as immoral as they are fake, and should never be dropped to the little ones—or really, to anyone; and if they must be served, then only as a secret drop post-sacrifice—not of an eleusinian pig, but some mythical creature you can barely cop. 

should our youth be hyped to disrespect their dads like zeus does, or should our citizens start beef after watching godly brawls? should they vibe with the story of hephaestus tying up his own mom, and zeus yeeting him for even trying to step in when she got smacked? these tales might have some mystical subtext, but lowkey, the young just ain’t built to decode that allegory, no cap. 

if anyone asks which tales are cool to share, we’ll clap back: we’re lawmakers, not the book-drop artists; we just set the vibes for how books should be written—the writing itself is on someone else’s grind. 

and our numero uno rule is this: god must be repped as he truly is—not as the boss of all things, but as the ultimate plug for good vibes only. 

we ain’t about to let poets say he’s the steward of both good and evil, or that he’s packing two barrels of destinies; nor that athene and zeus hyped pandarus into wrecking a treaty; or that god is behind niobe’s pain, pelops’ drama, or the whole trojan saga; or even that he makes men sin on a whim just to shut ‘em down. either these moves weren’t even from the gods, or god was straight-up fair and men leveled up through their punishments. but to claim that a wicked deed was god’s cap—that’s some vile, self-destructive fiction we ain’t letting anyone, old or new, drop. that’s our first and major rule—god only drops the good vibes.

and rule two, just as fire, is this: god is unchanging—no remix, no flex. reason shows us that if we suppose god ever switched it up, he’d have to be changed either by some other force or by himself. by someone else? nah—the dopest natural art and the sickest mind vibes aren’t twisted by outside forces. by himself? he can’t upgrade his own vibe; he basically stays the ultimate bae forever. so we’re not tryna listen to poets spinning tales of god begging in a priestess look or deities prowling at night in cray disguises; that blasphemous cap that moms use to mess with their kids must get shut down. 

but someone might say, “yo, god’s unchanging but he could totally vibe with us in some form.” why should he? just like humans, gods hate that fake energy in the soul; and any other hustle of cap that’s pulled off for some purpose and even passed as innocent—what’s the gods’ need for that mess? they ain’t as clueless about antiquity as those poets, ain’t shook by haters, and no madman is a homie of theirs. so god is 100% true—he don’t change, he don’t play with fakes, be it day or night, word or sign. that’s our second major rule—god is true. 

away with agamemnon’s lying dream in homer and thetis’ bogus diss on apollo in aeschylus…

to break down his state brainstorm, plato kicks it off by tracing the OG principles of mutual need and squad specialization in an imaginary crew of four or five peeps. gradually, that tiny crew levels up; the division of labor expands to whole countries, with imports calling for exports, a cash flow system emerging, and retail homies chillin’ in the marketplace to save producers mad time on trades. these are the steps by which plato constructs the first, primitive state—dropping the early seeds of political economy. since he’s about to roll out a second, civilized state, the simple vibes naturally come before the complex remix.

he goes off, like rousseau, painting a retro picture of primitive life—a notion that’s had a major impact on mankind’s collective imagination—but he ain’t straight-up saying one state is inherently better than the other (politicus); and we shouldn’t pull extra inferences from the first state when it’s chopped up separately from the second, like aristotle tries in the politics. we ain’t meant to read a platonic dialogue as if it’s a literal how-to guide or dry report. on the flip side, when we vibe the lively imagination of plato against the dried-up abstractions of modern philosophy texts, we’re forced to agree with protagoras that “the mythus is more interesting” (protag.).

plato drops mad interesting notes that, in modern times, would totally land in a political economy thesis: laws, population, free trade, adulteration, wills and bequests, begging, eryxias (not even plato’s own), value and demand, republic, and that division of labor hustle. the whole retail trade origin thing gets laid out with epic clarity in the second book of the republic. but plato never mashed up his econ ideas into one neat system, and he never fully caught on that trade is one of the major energy boosters of both the state and the world. he’d only slot retail gigs to the lower-tier citizens (rep., laws), even though he straight-up notes (laws) that “if only the best men and the best women everywhere were forced to run taverns for a bit or handle retail trade, etc., then we’d really see how chill and dope all this stuff is.”

the squad’s vibe—glaucon’s disappointment over the “city of pigs,” the absurd rundown of luxury ministers in the refined state, the later shout-out to the need for docs, that dope analogy of a guardian drawn from a dog, the flex of needing some ultra-rare sacrifice when throwing impure mysteries, and even zeus’ shady moves toward his dad and hephaestus’ on his mom—these hilariously deep touches pack some serious meaning. 

talking edu, plato straight-up startles us by saying a kid must be schooled in cap (falsehood) first and then on real truth later. but really, that’s just like saying kids gotta get hit with imagination and reason together; their brains level up gradually, and there’s mad stuff they learn without truly decoding. that’s the core of plato’s view—even if he splits the line differently than modern ethical writers when it comes to truth versus cap. 

we’re like, “nah fam,” to any edu hacks or cozy vibes unless they’re absolutely needed by our human faculties or for straight-up schoolin’ the simple and ignorant. the words gotta match the intent, and we can’t be “falsely true”—dropping cap to back up what’s right. but plato limits the use of fictions by demanding they drop a solid moral punch, and that dangerous weapon of falsehood stays strictly a state-only flex for the rulers when they’re goin’ big.

a greek in plato’s era didn’t sweat whether his religion was legit historical—he was just starting to peep that the past had its own history, but nothing went beyond homer and hesiod. whether those stories were real or cap didn’t really mess with the political or social vibe of hellas. peeps only started thinking, “these are fakes,” when they realized the stories were immoral. so, in every religion, the moral juice comes first, and only then do we worry about the actual truth of the docs or the natural or supernatural tea spilled in them. 

but in modern times—especially in protestant zones more than catholic—we’ve been extra, trying to mash up historical fact with morality; and some straight up ghost religion unless every part of the record shows superhuman accuracy. ancient or religious facts are major keys, but they’re often sus, and we only catch the true lesson by rising above them. these vibes show that the diff between plato and us, though real, ain’t as massive as it might first seem. we’re totally down with him putting morals before the historical tea on religion; and, for real, we’re cool ignoring the inevitable slip-ups or fact error drops that come with the early hype of any religion. plus, we know shifting a country’s traditions isn’t an overnight flex—so we cut mad slack for stuff that science and critics might roast.

side note: the allegorical readin’ of myth—said to be dropped as early as the sixth century bc by theagenes of regel—was fully on deck in plato’s day, and here, just like in the phaedrus (though for diff reasons), he was like, “nah, not my vibe.” swapping out anachronistic religion or law for fresh fables when civilizations level up? that’s just universal experience, bet. big ups to the art of interpretation; once you crack that process, anything unchangeable gets rephrased away. so, without any major glitches, two religion styles coexisted: the tradition inherited or cooked up by poets with their temple-worship vibe, and on the flip side, the philosopher’s religion—chillin’ in the heaven of ideas—but still down to drop a cock to aesculapius or be seen praying at sunrise. eventually, the beef between pop religion and philosopher vibes—which used to be massive among the greeks like it is in our era—just faded to being the diff between the educated and uneducated religious squads. zeus from homer and hesiod smoothly slid into plato’s “royal mind” (philebus), and giant heracles morphed into a knight-errant, the ultimate benefactor of mankind. all these wild transformations were flexed by the stoics and neo-platonists in the two or three centuries pre and post christ. greek and roman religions slowly soaked up the philosophy drip; once they lost their ancient mojo, they morphed into pure poetry and morality—and probably were the purest when their influence was already on the decline.

at the tail-end of the book, a wild idea pops off: the lie in the soul. this cap is linked to the platonic-socratic vibe that involuntary ignorance is even worse than choosing to stay in the dark. the lie in the soul is the real deal—a straight-up falsehood that corrupts the dopest truth, tricking the highest part of your soul, leaving the victim with zero power to yeet themselves out of it. 

for example, calling god fake, immoral, or—according to plato—the ultimate trickster who drops illusions or writes evil into the script; or backing up protagoras when he says “knowledge is sensation,” or that “being is becoming,” or thrasymachus’s “might is right” cap, would all be seen by plato as that hella hateful kind of lie. the peak form of unintentional cap—like if “he who was blind” (in the gospels, john style) straight up said “i see”—is another sick facet of the messed-up mind state plato describes. you could even compare this soul cap to the sin against the holy ghost (luke), keeping in mind the diff vibes between greek and christian lingo. in contrast, there’s the lie in words—just the type of fib you drop in a play, poem, allegory, or sick figure of speech. while that kind of cap might be useless to the gods, it can totally work for us mortals in certain sitches. socrates is here droppin’ answers to his own question about whether it’s cool to ghost a madman with deception; he’s also laying down the diff between god’s nature and man’s vibe. see, god is truth, but humans can only hit that truth when they sometimes play partial or even fake. 

saving the big questions of religion and edu for later, let’s note a few more things: (1) mad props for the old-school traditional edu of greece; (2) plato gearing up to throw shade at homer and the poets; (3) plato also setting the stage for econ moves in the state; (4) and his smooth, low-key snark when he drops hints to the “chronique scandaleuse” of the gods, both high up and low down.

book iii.

now peep this: another major motive in cleaning up religion is to kick fear straight out—‘cause no one’s gonna be brave if they’re shook on death or buying into those gloomy underworld tales that the poets keep recycling. they gotta be gently told to chill on trashing hell, and reminded that those stories are pure cap and hella depressing. 

and they shouldn’t get wound up if we yeet out annoying passages—like achilles’ depressing drip: “i’d rather be a serving-man than rule over all the dead,” or verses spitting on the crummy mansions, senseless shadows, a wandering soul mourning lost strength and youth, a soul drifting under the earth like ghostly smoke, or suitors’ souls flapping around like bats. the terror of cocytus and styx, ghosts, spiritless shades, and the rest of that tartarean lingo gotta vanish. sure, these tales might’ve had their use, but they ain’t the right fuel for our soldier squad. similarly, we can’t vibe with the sob fest of homeric heroes—achilles, thetis’ boy, crying and flinging ashes, pacing the shore in distraction; or priam, god-cousin vibes, wailing and rolling in the grime. a solid dude ain’t gonna crumble over losing kids or cash. death’s not a monster either; so big flex peeps shouldn’t be out here mourning the dead. that sob story business should be left to the extra, whether dude or chick.

even worse is handing those weak vibes to the gods—like when goddesses be all, “alas! my travail!” and, worst of all, when the king of heaven himself moans about not saving hector or gets emo over his dear sarpedon’s impending game over. if our young squad don’t roast that weak sauce, they’ll end up copying it. and our citizens shouldn’t be gotten carried away with nonstop laughs—‘cause such violent delights are always followed by a savage comeback. we’re not down with that scene in the iliad where gods be clapping at hephaestus’ clumsy mess. “certainly not.”

truth gotta be the top-tier vibe among all virtues, ‘cause falsehood is straight useless to the gods and only works as a low-key remedy for us. but using cap has gotta stay as a state-only flex; the average homie must never drop a lie on the ruler—just like a patient wouldn’t fib to their doc or a sailor to their captain.

in the next spot our youngins gotta keep it chill—with self-control and straight-up vibes for authority, no cap. homer drops this wisdom in some of his bars: "the achaean squad marched on flexin' with mad prowess, lowkey in silent awe of their leaders;" but then, in other tracks, he goes "yo, you're so wrecked on the sauce, sporting the eyes of a dog but the heart of a stag." trust, that extra cray energy ain’t gonna boost the inner zen of our squad.

same goes for his hype on grub and grog, and his absolute fear of going hangry; plus, those verses where he spills the tea on the wild, rapturous loves of zeus and hera—or how hephaestus once yeeted ares and aphrodite into a net sesh—ain't the move. there's a higher vibe in the line, "endure, my soul, thou hast endured worse." and yo, we can’t let our peeps get bribed or be droppin' lines like "gifts persuade the gods, gifts for venerable kings;" nor can we let anyone clap for phoenix’s shady advice to achilles about squeezing cash from the greeks before even coming to help; or for achilles’ own cringe hustle of snagging gifts from agamemnon; or his wild move demanding a ransom for hector's body; or his cursing of apollo; or his straight-up disrespect to the river god scamander; or dedicating his own hair to dead patroclus that was already on loan to the other river god spercheius; or dragging hector's body around the walls and yeeting the captives at the bonfire—yo, that toxic mix of low-key meanness and savage cruelty in cheiron’s student is unthinkable. and the lovey-dovey antics of peirithous and theseus? totally unworthy. either these so-called demigods ain’t really offspring of the gods, or they ain’t quite the epic flex the poets hype up—just like the gods themselves aren’t the original architects of bad juju. any youth who thinks that such wild shenanigans come from those with heavenly drip is gonna be way too ready to copy that mess.

alright, enough about gods and epic heroes—what about us mere mortals? the poets and storytellers be saying that the shady ones profit while the righteous keep catching l’s, or that justice is just somebody else’s coin. nah fam, we can’t let that bogus narrative slide. but yo, in droppin' this misinfo we’re kinda teasing out what justice really means, so let’s put that deep dive on hold for now.

moving on, we’ve dished out enough on poetry’s subject matter—next up is style. every poem is a narrative, whether it’s about what went down, what’s poppin’, or what’s about to go down; and narratives come in three flavors: the simple, the copycat, and a mashup of both. check this: homer’s first scene is that mixed vibe, partly description and partly dialogue. now, if you flip the dialogue into an indirect shout-out—like "oratio obliqua"—it rolls out as: the priest pulls up and prays to apollo, asking that the achaean crew snatch troy and bounce home safe if agamemnon just returns his daughter; the other greeks are like "bet," but agamemnon catches mad heat, and so on. then the whole joint turns into a description, leaving only the poet on mic; or if you ditch the narrative, it’s all pure dialogue. these are the three styles—and which ones get to crash our state’s party? "you ask if tragedy and comedy are in?" sure, but there’s more—aren’t we even questioning if our guardians should be copycats at all? in fact, we already dropped that one: a dude can’t flex multiple roles in one life, any more than he can drop both tragic and comic acts or be a rhapsodist and actor at once. human nature’s like minted in tiny pieces, and our guardians already got the heavy biz of guarding freedom, so they don’t need to be out here imitating all sorts of weak roles. if they do mimic, let it only be the good vibes—'cause the mask an actor rocks is liable to stick as his true face.

yo, we can’t let dudes play the roles of women—acting out all that drama with quarreling, crying, scolding, or throwing shade at the gods—especially not when it’s all about lovin' or in the heat of labor. they also can’t be parading as slaves, bullies, cowards, drunks, madmen, blacksmiths, neighing horses, bellowing bulls, noisy rivers, or a raging sea. a solid, wise dude is down to perform dope and virtuous moves, but he’d be hella embarrassed to act a subpar part he’s never even tried; he’d rather rock a plain descriptive style with barely any imitation. meanwhile, the dude with zero self-respect will mimic literally anyone and anything—nature’s sounds and animal cries included—his whole act just a copy of gestures and voices. in descriptive style, changes are few, but in dramatic style there’s a whole remix going on. poets and beat-makers might roll with either, or mash them up, and that combo is mad attractive to youngins, their mentors, and even the normies. but in our state, where every dude is locked into one vibe, we can’t handle extra layers. so when one of these polyphonic, pantomime kings struts up with his verse, we’ll show him respect—but also break it to him that his kind isn’t welcome here; we’re all about that raw, honest poet drip, sticking to our OG models (laws).

next up: music. a song or ode be split into three parts—the subject, the harmony, and the rhythm—with the last two riding on the first’s vibe. since we already ghosted those lamentation beats, we can now also boot the mixed lydian harmonies (basically the sob tunes); and since our citizens gotta be chill, we’re also axing those over-the-top, party vibes like ionian and pure lydian. what remains are two dope flavors—the dorian and the phrygian: dorian for war mode and phrygian for peace, one blasting out courage and the other droppin’ obedience, schooling, or religious feels. and since we’re cutting off extra harmony varieties, we’re also saying bye to those many-stringed, all-over-the-place instruments that spit ‘em out—especially the flute, which is just way too complex. the lyre and the harp can still roll in town, while the pan’s-pipe is cool for the fields. so we’ve cleaned house in the music realm, and now we’re gonna do the same with metres. these should be as simple and on point as the harmonies. there are, like, four notes in a tetrachord, and three metre ratios—3/2, 2/2, 2/1—each packing its own flavor, and the feet come with their own moves and rhythms. but yo, on this we gotta holla at damon, that legendary music boss, who dropped the deets on a martial measure along with dactylic, trochaic, and iambic flows, balancing syllables perfectly, each with its own weight. we’re just here to flex the overall rule: style should fit the subject and the metre should vibe with the style; the soul’s own chill and harmony should shine through in everything. this simplicity game is something everyone’s gotta pick up in their youth, whether from the creative arts or just by peeping the forms of plants and animals.

moreover, other artists—and poets—need a serious heads-up against being extra mean or downright unseemly. sculpture and painting, just like music, must stick to the law of simplicity. anyone breaking that rule isn’t allowed to work in our city or corrupt the taste of our citizens. our guardians gotta grow up surrounded by clean, dope visuals—not ugly, twisted images that slowly wreck their souls—but in a realm of health and beauty where every scene pours in sweet, harmonious vibes. and among all these influences, music’s the ultimate teacher, sneaking into the innermost soul and schooling it on real beauty versus deformity. at first, the effect is lowkey, but once reason kicks in, the trained soul meets it like an old bestie. it’s like learning to read: you start with the individual letters, then their combos, and only then can you see the full picture; likewise, we must first nail down the core forms of virtue and then spot their remix in real life. there’s a music of the soul that matches the world’s harmony, and the dopest output of a musical soul is a lit mind in a fit body. sure, a little flaw in the body is forgivable, but not if it’s in the mind. real love is straight-up temperance’s daughter, and temperance is totally opposed to the wild madness of physical pleasure. enough on music—it wraps up this saga with love on a high note.

next, let’s talk gym—our physical hustle. the lowdown is that the soul runs the show like a cause and the body is just the effect; so if we level up the mind, we can let the body handle its own training, giving a basic blueprint for the workout. first off, our guardians gotta ghost strong drink—they should be the last ones to lose their cool. whether the regular gym grind (palaestra habits) suits them is debatable, since standard workouts can be super sleepy, and halting them suddenly might wreck health. but our warrior athletes need to be ultra-awake and resilient, ready to roll with all kinds of food and climate curveballs. they need a workout as straightforward as their music; and for their grub, homer sets the rule: his heroes chow down on roast meat only—no fish even if they’re seaside, no boiled meats that need pots and pans, and (fr, if i’m not mistaken) zero sweet sauces. sicilian cookery, attic desserts, and corinthian courtezans—basically the extra flavors that are to gym what lydian and ionian jams are to music—must be totally off-limits. where gluttony and extra partying rule, the town ends up overrun with docs and whiny lawyers; and as soon as the free peeps start caring, law and med get all high-key extra. but what’s more cringe in education than having to bounce abroad for justice because you got zilch at home? even worse is when folks flex pride in the twists of the law, forgetting it’d be way slicker if they just strutted through life without needing a nodding justice. and it’s equally lame to hire a doc not to fix legit wounds or outbreaks, but ‘cause you got lazy and extra, picking up diseases that weren’t even a thing in asclepius’ time. homer’s med style was hella simple: after getting wounded, eurypylus downs a hot posset of pramnian wine to warm up, and none of asclepius’ sons call out the girl who served it or patroclus who was on duty. real talk: this modern disease-nursing hustle was kicked off by herodicus the trainer, who—being a bit of a sickly dude—mixed training with meds, tortured himself and a bunch of others, and then lived way longer than he should’ve. but asclepius was like, "nah, i ain’t about that life," ’cause he knew that in a solid state, citizens don’t have time for being sick. so he rolled with the "kill or cure" method, the hustle artisans and laborers use: "they gotta be on their grind, no time for mollycoddling—if they bounce back, cool; if not, game over." meanwhile, rich dudes are supposed to be all gentlemanly about being ill. ever peep a maxim from phocylides dropping that when a man starts getting rich (or maybe even a bit earlier) he should flex virtue? but how can obsessing over health jive with a regular hustle, yet match that virtue grind phocylides preached? if a student thinks philosophy gives him a headache, he never does shit—always feeling off. that’s why asclepius and his crew skipped that game. they were all about serving the public, not preserving useless lives or raising weak offspring for lame dads. they cured real illnesses straight-up; if a dude got hurt, they applied the proper fixes and then let him chow down however he wanted. but they straight-up ghosted the extra intemperate and worthless subjects—even if those cases could’ve raked in major coin. as for the pindar tale—about asclepius getting zapped by a thunderbolt for bringing a rich dude back to life—yo, that’s bogus. following our old code, we gotta say either he didn’t take any shady bribes, or he wasn’t even a god’s kid.

then glaucon rolls up to socrates, asking if the top docs and judges aren’t the ones who’ve been through the wildest disease and crime marathons. socrates breaks it down: a physician needs to have sampled disease firsthand, 'cause he heals with his mind, not his bod; but a judge is all about controlling mind by mind, so his dome’s gotta stay untainted by crime. so where’s he supposed to get his street cred? how can he be both wise and squeaky-clean? when you're young, even a solid dude can get played by the shady ones since he hasn’t got any evil backup in him yet; hence, the judge should be seasoned—his youth pure and his insight on evil gained from peeping it in others, not from doing it himself. that’s the dream judge. sure, an ex-criminal turned sleuth might be dripping with suspicion, but when he’s chillin’ with real peeps who’ve been there, he ends up trippin’, thinking everyone’s as toxic as he is. you can learn about vice from virtue, but vice will never really know virtue. this is the type of med and law game that’ll run our state—they’ll be healing arts for the dope souls, while the rotten bod gets left to crash and the corrupted soul gets deleted. and if you mix in top-tier music to vibe the soul and solid gym to keep the bod on point, you’ll barely ever need either. not that this split between music and gym truly maps to soul and body—both are all about that inner self, with music taming it and gym hyping it up. together, they shape our guardians’ dual nature. if you overdo gym, your fiery side gets hardened and brutal; if you overdose on music, that gentle, philosopher vibe becomes all enervated. let a dude drown in music streaming into his ears like water down a funnel, and watch his soul’s edge slowly wear away as his spark just melts off. too little spirit and you’re done; too much and you're all jittery like a noob in a lag spike. so, again, an athlete who fuels up and trains hard might double his bravery—but soon he turns into a dumb beast, all about throwing punches and none about strategy or chill policy. there are two vibes in a man: reason and passion, and it’s these two that the arts of music and gym link up with—not the soul and body per se. the real master is the one who blends them in perfect harmony; that dude becomes the true music genius, the head boss of our state.

next question: who gets to be our rulers? first off, the elder gotta lead the younger; the dopest elders are the ultimate guardians. they’re the best if they truly love their squad and are down with their peeps for the state’s win. these are our picks—but they need to be watched at every stage to make sure they keep it 100 and don’t flip when hit with force or sweet talk. ‘cause time, smooth persuasion, and mad pleasure vibes can totally reroute a guy’s mission, and heavy grief can twist him up. so our guardians gotta be tested through and through—like gold in a refiner’s fire—having rolled through danger, then pleasure, and coming out clean and bossed up at every age, with all their skills synced for the state’s gain. these legends deserve the highest honors in life and even after death. (maybe we should drop "guardians" only for these elite peeps, and tag the younger ones as "auxiliaries.")

now for one epic, flashy lie—imagine if training our rulers was possible! anyway, let’s try this out on the rest of the world. what i’m about to drop is just another remix of the cadmus legend; but our skeptical gen might be slow to vibe with this story. the tale’s gotta be spread first to the rulers, then the soldiers, and lastly to the people. we’ll tell them that their youth was like a wild dream, and that while they thought they were in school, they were really being molded in the earth—who’d spit them out when they were fire-ready; and that they must protect and cherish the earth, since they’re all her kids, treating each other like tight siblings. (i ain’t surprised if you’re lowkey cringing at this fiction.) there’s more to it: these sibs come with different flavors—some divinely crafted to rule, forged out of gold; others hella made of silver, meant to back up the crew; and others to be farmers and makers, shaped from brass and iron. but since they all come from the same OG source, a golden parent might have a silver kid, or a silver parent a golden son—and then rank flips gotta go down; the rich kid must drop in rank, while the artisan’s child climbs up the social ladder; 'cause an oracle even dropped that the state is doomed if ruled by a dude made of brass or iron. will our peeps ever vibe with all this? maybe not this gen, but in the next one, bet.

now let the earthborn homies roll out under their rulers’ command—scout out and set up camp on high ground, safe from outside haters and inside rebellions. there, they can make sacrifices and pitch their tents; they’re meant to be soldiers, not shopkeepers—the watchdogs and guardians of the flock. if luxury and greed start flexing, they’ll flip into wolves and tyrants. their habits and cribs gotta match their schooling. they should own zero property; their pay should just cover their basic needs; and they should feast together on common meals. we’ll school them that their gold and silver are gifts straight from god, and that the divine swag in their souls must stay untainted by that low-tier earthly dross masquerading as gold. citizens aren’t allowed to even touch it, share a roof with it, or sip from it—it's cursed, fam. if they ever score their own houses, lands, or coin, they’ll end up as homebodies and hustlers instead of guardians, flipping into foes and tyrants instead of ride-or-die helpers—and that spells doom for both them and the state.

the religious and ethical side of plato’s edu is gonna get its own deep-dive later on its own head. for now, we can peep some of the smaller deets right here.

1. yo, check it – plato be all flexin’ on homer, summoning him like an OG witness to spill tea on ethics, psyches, diets, and meds, no cap. he’s out here tryna separate the fire lesson from the cringe one, remixing the text on a whim; like, multiple times he drops quote after quote or sneaky nods to homer that are lowkey off – kinda like those early logographers who yeeted the iliad into prose and then went full meme mode with wild inferences and absurd spin-offs. he ain’t losing his cool over homer and archilochus like heracleitus would; nah, plato rides their vibes as a whip to a higher truth – not on some rigid system like theagenes of rhegium, metrodorus, or even the later stoics, but just however his fancy flows. the conclusions he drops are solid, even if the starting points are straight-up fictional. these extra homer callouts add a major glow to plato’s style, while also serving as savage shade on the goofy homeric reads. to us (and prolly even to him), they might look like arguments, but lowkey they’re just clever figures of speech – like modern scripture drops that pack pzazz even when the OG meaning is long gone. the real mood, like platonic socrates himself (as xenophon’s memorabilia shows), was all about that remix life. from ancient times to now, in religion, law, and lit, the art of interpretation has always been the ultimate flex.

2. "the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style." for real, even though the word "classical" has us all shook, it’s hard to say that every single piece of greek poetry vibing down to us already follows that rule. we can’t front that sometimes the ideas are next-level and outpace clear expression in aeschylus and pindar; or that in the case of the sophist-poet euripides, rhetoric comes in clutch over actual thought. maybe only sophocles drops that perfect blend – where his language is as graceful as a greek statue that’s lit, with nothing extra needed; at least in parts or whole plays. meanwhile, the connections in tragic choruses and greek lyric poets can get all tangled up like a bad wifi signal in an age before logic, leaving the poet unable to sort it out ‘cause his mind’s loaded with so many feels he can’t unzip ‘em properly. there’s this subtle logical influence that needs to jump from dull prose to gorgeously rhythmic poetry, just as smooth language and killer music can elevate plain speech. throughout the ages, poets have been famously bad judges of their own hustle (apol. even said so) – they don’t peep that the words that vibe perfectly in their own mind might be total head-scratchers for someone else; or that the sequence clear to them is just a maze to the average listener. i mean, plenty of our modern poetic bangers are way too vague; where style and subject don’t even match up – half-baked figures, clunky constructions, weird word mashups, and random idea flows drop in without warning; and there’s zero natural sweetness or musicality to boost the feels. like, can you even have poetry without beauty or beauty without clarity? the early greek poet’s confusion was a must-have given the language and logic dumpster fire of their time. they’re not really models for us; language should only get clearer, generation after generation. like shakespere, they were epic in spite of their expression fails – but there’s zero reason to slide back to the murky origin era of literature. the english poets of last century had it on lock, and there’s no excuse for ditching their glow-up, or for regressing to that awkward pre-upgrade phase. our modern thoughts haven’t outpaced our words; a lack of plato’s "art of measuring" is literally the main culprit behind that mismatch.

3. in book three of the republic, plato goes all in on art theory like nowhere else, fam. his take? true art ain’t about being extra or just copyin’ – it’s about being simple and ideal, the pure expression of the highest moral vibes whether you’re on the grind or just chillin'. livin’ among art that’s noble and unpretentious, or listening to beats that hit that same note, is the ultimate influencer – the genuine greek atmosphere in which the youth should grow up. that’s how you naturally level up taste, so you’re tuned into truth and beauty in everything. even if the poets get yeeted, art still shines as a different form of reason – kinda like love in the symposium, spread out over the same zone but only affecting those early vibes and working through habit; and this idea of art isn’t just jam sessions or sculpted forms, but a full-on vibe that seeps through all of nature with global remix potential. plato’s republic, much like pericles’ athens, is not just political – it’s got some serious arty drip too.

4. plato drops a subtle, true gem: a doctor should not be in perfect health; he’s gotta know his own sick game up close. but a judge? that dude should never have been down with the bad vibes – he’s gotta be a stand-up guy who spent his youth in pure, uncorrupted mode and only later got exposed to everyone else’s vice. so, according to plato, a judge shouldn’t be a young blood – just as aristotle thinks a young dude isn’t ready to vibe with moral philosophy lectures. meanwhile, the bad ones might know a thing or two about vice but are clueless on virtue. though, i guess this whole train of thought might be a bit sus. in a wild drop from the laws, it’s admitted that the baddies can actually size up the good properly. that rare mix of gentleness and boldness in book ii, which initially seems like a paradox, later turns out to be the real deal. and plato might have also peeped that an intuition for evil can vibe perfectly with a hardcore dislike for it. there’s a straight-up aim in virtue that gives extra insight into vice. knowing someone’s character is kinda like an innate sensor – not needing any super special experience with either good or evil.

5. one of plato’s most insane ideas – totally un-greek and a wild outlier in his era – is the whole rank shuffle. in spartan society, helots got some rights while citizens sometimes got downgraded in special situations. and in ancient greek aristocracies, merit was a solid part of the government game. founders were seen as the ultimate benefactors, raised by their epic moves to tower above the baseline human level; later on, warriors and lawmakers scored enough creds to earn exclusive citizen perks and top-tier status. even though the existence of a perfect aristocracy is kinda iffy when you piece together early greek history, and it’s hard to pin that vibe to any one state – or any state ever, really – the rule of the best was always the dream for philosophers, who flexed their ancient history views to match their ideal government designs. plato is all about dunkin’ on his state’s guardians by putting them through a series of tests so that anyone not meeting his fixed standard gets yeeted from power or never admitted; this “academic” discipline was actually on point in greek states, especially in sparta. he also throws shade at the old-school caste system – which was huge in ancient, and even modern european, scenes – saying it should be ditched sometimes in favor of raw merit. he gets how most people are hella salty about someone messing with the natural order, so he wraps his revolutionary idea in what he calls a “monstrous fiction.” (peep the prep for the two “great waves” in book v for extra tea.) he lays out two principles: first, there’s a pre-individual rank vibe based on your starting conditions; and second, that this rank game can totally be flipped by your own standout qualities. he even remixes mythology – like those homeric epics – to suit the state’s needs, using “the phoenician tale” as his idea ride-share. every greek state had its own origin myth; so plato’s republic could easily spin an earthborn man saga. the weight and apparent realism of his myth, backed by greek tradition, totally validates the “monstrous falsehood.” while ancient poetry jabbed about gold, silver, brass, and iron ages stacking up one after the other, plato’s like, nah, these different human vibes can exist all together in one state. mythology gives you that picture frame to teach the lesson (like protagoras always saying “the myth is more interesting”), and it lets plato drop new ideas without too much deets. in this drop, he hints at a broad truth without laying out the full step-by-step on the rank switch. honestly, throughout the republic, he’s all about letting the lower ranks fade into the background. we don’t even know if they’re supposed to be armed, or if in book five they’re tied into those communistic property and marriage vibes. no point in fighting over random words, or over plato’s silent gaps, or in reading into stuff beyond his vision. even aristotle, when throwing shade at the lower classes, totally misses that poetic creation is “like the air, invulnerable,” and can’t be busted by his logic arrows (pol.).

6. two mind-blowing paradoxes in book three are gonna get you shook: first, the epic power of music – way beyond any vibes we get these days, even though our art and science have totally leveled up discovering the secrets to harmony and melody; and second, the almost absolute clout the soul is supposed to rock over the body.

for the first, it might be a bit extra – like some modern maestros who are known for that high-energy hype. with a raw enthusiasm that only a select few catch, plato’s got a pythagorean respect for numbers and proportions that aristotle probably wouldn’t even vibe with. for him, sound intervals and numbers are sacred, rolling with their own laws, totally independent of our everyday sensory overload. they elevate above the everyday, linking us up with the arena of ideas. and yo, plato isn’t just spinning fantasy – he’s describing what seems like a legit fact. that chill, signature melody hitting the sensitive greek mind is a total power-up; think about how national anthems hit different. plus, there’s this blend where the harmony of musical notes syncs perfectly with the harmony between the soul and body, creating pure magic.

the second paradox drops some wild Qs – how far can the mind actually control the body? is their hookup all about clashing vibes or full-on squad harmony? are they two separate entities or just one dope unit, and does one vibe create the other? maybe we should scrap the whole enemy-versus-friend narrative and view this human combo as one simple entity? at the very least, we gotta admit there’s a high-key and low-key component in human nature, not split by a clear line, that sometimes even go off and throw hands, or else merge and move in sync, whether it’s in everyday life or in the pursuit of that noble, hard-earned goal where every thought and nerve is maximized. then the body becomes like your best friend, wingman, or tool for the mind. and the mind sometimes flexes almost superhuman power to banish weakness and summon hidden strength. reason and desire, intellect and sensation, get in sync to form one bomb human being. they’re always parting and reconnecting; most times we don’t even peep the fine line between them. when the mind drops its order via cravings, we know there’s a call-and-response – one side says “drink,” while the other is like “nah, that’s bad news.” and we all know who’s the real boss. we’re also in charge of our own health, even though some forces are straight-up out of our control. but with long-term care and smooth management, we can almost be free agents, as long as we don’t drain ourselves and admit that all human freedom is capped by the laws of nature and mind.

yo, it’s a major letdown that plato, in his savage roast of the medicine game of his day, lowlights the power of diet. he’d be all about diseases that are clear-cut and can get a straight-up treatment plan. he’s hella scared of the weak sauce vibes messing with life’s ultimate grind. he doesn’t dip into the fact that time is the ultimate healer for both mind and body issues; that slow, steady remedies are way safer than those sudden, catastrophic fails. plus, he misses that nothing proves the mind’s influence on the body more than controlling what you eat and drink – or any other life move where true free will can shine, no cap.

7. now, some minor style tea:
(1) that extra, fake ignorance about music – plato’s way of saying he’s just breezing past the topic.
(2) the tentative, almost newbie vibe in how he builds up the state here, just like in book two.
(3) switching up whether the state is real or just a crazy dream – these are the tricks he uses to keep us locked in.
(4) the linking vibes prepping us for the full-on yeet-out of the poets in book x.
(5) and don’t sleep on the side-by-side visuals: the drama-loving litigator and the perpetual hypochondriac, the savage roast of phocylides’ maxim, how he drops the gold and silver citizen image into his talk, and the nod to asclepius’ practice – all deserve a solid clap.

book iv.
adeimantus said: "suppose someone comes at you, socrates, arguing that you’re making your citizens hella miserable – like, they’re choosing that life voluntarily; they’re supposed to be the top dogs of the city, but instead of having cribs, lands, and stacks like everyone else, they’re out here livin’ like mercenaries, always on guard." i added, "plus, they ain’t getting pay – just free chow – so they got zero coin for a getaway trip or even a side piece." "alright, so what’s your clapback?" my answer: "our guardians may or may not be the happiest humans out there – i wouldn’t be shook to see them crush it in the long run – but that’s not the goal of our constitution, which is built for the squad’s overall good, not just one group’s flex. imagine if i went to a sculptor and dissed him for paintin’ the eye – the dopest part of the face – for being black instead of purple; he’d be like, 'the eye’s gotta be an eye, king – you gotta peep the whole statue.'" "now, i can totally picture a fool’s paradise where everyone’s eating, drinking, and rockin’ purple and fancy linen, with potters chillin’ on sofas, wheel in hand, just cruisin’ whenever – and cobblers and every other crew in the city just lose their special drip. sure, a city might roll without cobblers; but if our guardians end up just kickin’ it as slack buddies, then the ruin is real. remember, we ain’t talkin’ about lazy peasants on vacay – this is a city where every homie’s expected to hustle their own work. the real happiness ain’t in one class, it’s in the vibe of the entire state. and here’s another thought: a middle-of-the-road status is best for artisans; they should have just enough coin to grab tools, but not so much they can dip out of the grind. and wouldn’t that same vibe be perfect for our citizens? if they’re broke, they’re petty; if they’re loaded, they get all extra and lazy; either way, no one’s really vibin’." "but then how is our scrappy city supposed to go to war against a rich enemy?" there might be some drama fighting one enemy; but facing two? that’s a slam dunk. first off, the battle would be between trained warriors and well-to-do citizens – and isn’t a regular athlete an easy match for a couple of burly opponents? also, picture this: before yelling war, we slide ambassadors into one enemy city saying, 'yo, we ain’t rockin’ silver or gold; help us out and scoop your share of the loot' – who’d wanna fight against a crew of lean, wiry pups when they could squad up to snatch the fattest sheeps? "but if a bunch of states pool their cash, are we not doomed?" i gotta laugh when you drop the word "state" for anything but our own. they might be "states" – a whole bunch in one – but not "a state" proper. in every state, there’re always two clashing squads – the rich vs. the poor – that you can pit against each other. but our state, if it stays true to its core, is gonna be, hands down, the mightiest of hellenic states.

to the size of the state ain't got no cap—the only limit is that unity flex; it can’t be mega huge or microscopic if it’s tryna roll as one squad, no cap. this is a secondary sitch, like that transposition plug dropped in the ancient tale of the earthborn homies. the lowkey message? every dude should vibe on his own unique skills and be totally in sync with himself—then the whole city squad gets united, fr. but all that is side hustle if you ain't giving education its due; education is the ultimate drip, the main boss move. when the wheel’s set in motion, it starts speeding up like a viral tiktok trend—each generation coming in with extra physical gains and moral glow-ups. our rulers gotta be on point, keeping the classic music and gym flows on lock; as damon once dropped, change a country's playlist and you'll soon be yeeting its laws into a remix. at first the change seems chill and playful, but before you know it, that supposedly innocent tweak spirals into a full-blown chaos fest—secretly messing with individual drip, social clout, biz vibes, and finally turning state institutions into a dumpster fire of confusion, periodt. but if education stays OG and solid, there’s zero danger—there’ll always be a glow-up process going down; that order vibe will always pull up what’s fallen. and yo, forget about extra rules for minor tea like manners or dress codes—like attracts like, whether it’s epic lit vibes or major cringe. education is the ultimate glitch fixer, setting you up with the power of self-governance. we ain’t here to spill all the deets of legislation; let the guardians handle schooling, and trust, education’s got the rest on lock.

without that proper schooling, people will just keep patching up their mess with their fave hacks, getting nowhere—like a patient stuck on his go-to remedy who won’t drop the bougie lifestyle for a real fix. if you tell these folks to switch up their habits, they flip out; they might call themselves charming, but nah, that’s just a fancy way of saying they’re extra stubborn. clearly these dudes ain’t in your fav list, and same goes for the state that vibes like them. then there are states that straight-up decree—with a death penalty flex—that no one can ever change the constitution, and yet they let themselves be manipulated by the crowd; anyone who stan’s them too hard ends up as their ride-or-die leader. “yeah, the dudes are as trash as the states,” they say. but don’t get it twisted—while you might wanna stan their cleverness, some are so brain-dead they totally believe every hype the people serve. when the entire net is telling a guy he’s six feet tall, and he’s got no legit measure, how’s he supposed to trust any other flex? but yo, don’t get heated: watching our politicos try their magic cures, smart enough to think they can slice off humanity’s hydra-level fails in one swat, is like front row seats to a messy play. those micro law drops are extra in lit states and straight-up useless in bogus ones.

so now, what’s left for lawmaking? nada for our squad; we’re leaving the ordering of the biggest flex—religion—to apollo, god of delphi. only our OG ancestral deity, chillin’ at the center (the navel, yo) of the earth gets our trust in a gig this massive. no foreign god is gonna be the top dog in our realms, periodt.

here, as socrates would drop, let’s “reflect on” (greek style) everything we’ve just spilled: so far we haven’t been chatting about citizens’ personal happiness, just the overall vibe of the state. sure, peeps could be living their happiest lives, but our main hustle in building the state wasn’t to max out their joy—it was to have them be guardians, not full-time holiday-makers. this smooth setup brings us to that legendary q that’s been vibing from ancient to modern philosophy—how duty hooks up with happiness, and how right links to utility.

first up, duty before happiness is the natural order in our moral playlists. the utilitarian principle is clutch as a fix for our mistakes, showing a side of ethics that’s usually ghosted. also, right and utility basically go hand in hand, and anyone who makes mankind’s happiness his main flex gets one of the dopest motives ever. but real talk: utility ain’t the OG foundation of morality, nor is it the angle that most moral or spiritual ideas drop on our minds. the ultimate happiness—like the glow-up of everything—is, we believe, the far-off result of the divine admin running the universe. a dude’s peak happiness is found in living a righteous, virtuous life, but we’re more solid on the law of right than on some mystical plan that saves all mankind; we deduce one from the other, periodt. and sometimes, individual happiness might flip the script—realized only through pain or even a chosen exit from life. furthermore, “happiness” is a multi-meme term—it can mean raw pleasure or an ideal life, be subjective or objective, for just you or for everyone, in this world or the next. modern utilitarian founders even lump self-centered and selfless motives under the same tag, even though we usually split them as benevolence vs. self-love. “happiness” doesn’t have the crisp, sacred vibe of “truth” or “right”—it doesn’t hit our higher souls as deep and is too tied to life’s cozy comforts, not enough to the “goods of the soul we crave for their own sake.” when you’re in the midst of an epic trial, danger, or temptation, that term barely registers. so, for all that, the “greatest happiness” rule ain’t the true bedrock of ethics. but even if it’s not numero uno, it’s the runner-up—a similar principle that’s often easier to flex, since most human moves aren’t strictly right or wrong unless they boost mankind’s overall vibe (introduction to gorgias and philebus).

the same q pops up in politics, where the so-called useful or expedient vibe tries to claim the spotlight and flex more authority. when droppin’ political moves, we mostly ask: how’s it leveling up mankind’s overall happy juice? but even here, that expediency is just the law of right, capped by the limits of human society. truth and right are the ultimate goals for both governments and individuals, and we shouldn’t ditch ‘em just because we can’t force them into existence. they appeal to the bright minds of nations, and sometimes they’re too extra for short-term gains to ignore. these are the hashtags every dude drops in public policy and even in private deals; europe’s chill vibe pretty much rides on ‘em. even in the most hustle-driven, utilitarian states, the power of ideas still slaps, and all the top-tier politicos carry that lit idealism—like pericles snagged from anaxagoras’s teachings. they know that the real leader must rise above petty ambition, and that a nation’s inner vibe is way more valuable than just cash and comfort. that’s the play in plato’s mind: first, have citizens do their duty; then, in a well-ordered state, their happiness is basically guaranteed. and yo, he wasn’t trashing the modern utility vibe in politics—other parts of his text straight-up proclaim that “the most beneficial is the most honourable” and even “the most sacred,” facts.

we may note:
1) the way adeimantus throws shade to deepen socrates’ argument—extra, but effective.
2) the idea that the entire squad, as one whole, is the foundation for both politics and art, with art using harmony, symmetry, measure, proportion, and unity as its one-and-only flex for criticism—totally greek vibes.
3) the must-have rule that the state stays low-key in size, following the OG greek model; like in aristotle’s politics, the small cities of hellas turned into a major principle, bet.
4) the hilarious memes of lean dogs and chonky sheep, of that scrappy boxer yeeting two stout dudes, of those “charming” patients who just make themselves extra messy; plus the playful idea that our state is the only real one, and the savage irony where a statesman is excused for thinking he’s six feet tall just ‘cause someone said so while his tape measure’s broke—he’s just too extra to get mad at.
5) the chill, almost surface-level treatment of religion once the two epic rules are locked in—first, keep religion riding the top-tier god vibes, and second, stay true to that legit national or hellenic aesthetic, periodt.

socrates then jumps in: yo, amidst all this wildness, where’s justice at? son of ariston, drop a pin and tell me where. light up a candle and comb through the city, and round up your bros and the rest of our squad to hunt her down. “that won’t do,” fires back glaucon, “you promised to lead the chase and dissed ditching justice.” i’m like, “bet, imma lead—y’all keep up.” my vibe is that our perfect state’s gotta flex all four core virtues—wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. if you yeet out the first three, what’s left is pure justice.

first up, wisdom: the state we assemble is gonna be wise on that political tip. “policy” ain’t like typical trade skills—it’s not carpentry, metalwork, or farming; it’s the art of dropping advice for the whole state’s perks. that’s the drip of the guardians, a tiny crew compared to the blacksmiths, but they pack all the state’s brain juice. if these few OG rulers are wise af, the entire state be flexin’ smarts.

next, our second virtue is courage, and we spot that vibe straight off in the soldier squad. courage is like that epic saving grace—the never-failing backup of the right opinions that law and education set down about danger. think of it like dyers prepping a fresh white base then slapping on some bold purple that sticks so hard no soap or lye can ever erase it. here, education is the solid groundwork and laws are the vibrant dye; if the base is built right, neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear can wash away that truth. this power locking in proper danger vibes? that’s what i call “courage”—or even “political” or “civilized” courage to set it apart from basic animal hustle and that next-level valor we might drop later.

two more vibes remain: temperance and justice. more than the earlier virtues, temperance screams harmony. peep the classic call of a dude being “master of himself”—which sounds kinda absurd ‘cause the master is also doing servant work—but really it means the better part of you totally bosses the weak sauce in you. cities are full of whole crews—like women, slaves, and the like—that represent the lower tier, while only a few show the high-key strengths; in our state, the upper crew keeps the lower ones in check. so where does temperance belong? on both teams, fam. our ideal state is the hangout for temperance—it’s that all-over harmony that syncs everyone up, tuning the upper, middle, and lower classes like the strings on a killer instrument, even if they differ in wisdom, strength, or coin.

alright, squad, now we’re almost there; let’s close in and keep our eyes peeled so justice doesn’t yeet away. if you peep any movement in the brush, holler first. “nah, i’mma let you take charge,” you say? aight then—say a quick prayer and follow my lead. the path’s dark and tricky, but we gotta push on. i’m peeping a track now—“good news!” why, glaucon, our clueless vibes are straight-up hilarious! while we strain our eyes on the horizon, justice is literally tumbling at our feet. we’re like those folks searching for something that’s been in their hands the whole time. remember our OG rule about division of labor, that every dude should stick to his own hustle from the very start of our state? that, my friends, was justice. is there any other virtue that can stack up against wisdom, temperance, and courage in the political flex? because the ultimate goal of government is making sure everyone keeps to their own lane—and the whole point of trade is that everyone runs their own shop. sure, a carpenter dipping into cobbler vibes or vice versa ain’t the worst, but when a cobbler flips the script and becomes a guardian or lawmaker, or one dude tries to be trainer, warrior, and legislator all at once, that’s where the major sus—actual injustice—comes in, with everyone doing someone else’s biz. i ain’t saying we’re at the final boss level conclusion yet; the definition that works for states still needs that individual test. having peeped the big pic, we now zoom back to the nitty-gritty—mix those together and bam, a brilliant light drops.

socrates then goes full detective mode on justice using a method of residues. each of the first three virtues vibes with one of the three parts of the soul—and one of the three classes in the state—even though temperance comes off more like a chill harmony than a hardcore trait. if there’s a fourth virtue, it can only be found in how these three parts or classes interact with each other. it’s hella obvious and basic, which is probably why no one’s pinned it down yet. modern logicians might be like, “yo, you can’t just separate ideas like mixing chemicals—they blend into one another as different takes on the same drip,” and honestly, in this sitch that totally checks out. the definition of justice here is, word for word, the same as one of socrates’ provisional takes on temperance in the charmides (which he later yeeted), so justice doesn’t really stick around as a separate factor once you ghost the other virtues. temperance seems like a part-only vibe, one of three, while justice is that all-in, universal virtue of the whole soul. and yet, temperance is also tagged as a kind of harmony, so in that sense it’s in the same fam as justice. justice only differs from temperance in degree, not in the whole essence—temperance is the harmony among a mixed-up crew, while justice is the perfect order where everyone’s doing their own thing: the right dude in the right spot, with everyone divided up and cooperating like a dream team. justice is also a more abstract concept than the other virtues, which is why, in plato’s view, it’s the foundation that all the other virtues lean on—a blueprint that comes before them. if you think dropping temperance is deep, it’s really just a slick style move to avoid monotony.

now, there’s this iconic q from one of plato’s earlier dialogues (protagoras; arist. nic. ethics): “are the virtues one squad or a whole mixtape?” the answer vibes that there are four cardinal virtues—brought together for the first time in ethical philosophy—with one supreme over the rest. this isn’t like aristotle’s take on universal justice, where virtue’s just about being relative to others; it’s about the entire virtue lineup in relation to its parts. following that universal take of justice or order in our first round of education and in the moral core of peeps, we then see an even more universal idea of the good in later learning and the realm of deep speculative knowledge. both of these can be tagged with hashtags like “law,” “order,” or “harmony;” but while the idea of good is an all-time, all-existence vibe, the concept of justice stays strictly on the human level.

socrates is now gonna break down the individual and the state, but first he’s gotta flex that the soul’s got three distinct squads. his argument goes like this: quantity ain’t got nothin’ to do with quality. the word “just,” whether it’s dished out to an individual or the state, means the same vibe—no cap. and “justice” implies that the identical three principles in both the state and the individual are just handling their own business. but fr, are they really three squads or just one mega squad? this is a hard nut to crack, and our current methods are totally sus for solving it; plus, the deep-dive route would totally eat up our time. “the short version is chill with me.” so, ya’d agree that the state’s drip is all about the vibes of its peeps, right? the scythians and thracians are mad passionate, our own crew is straight-up intellectual, and the egyptians and phoenicians are hella greedy, ‘cause each homie’s got its own character. the real flex is figuring out whether these principles are separate or one big squad—like, are we using one part of our vibe to reason, another to crave memes, and yet another to go off, or is the whole soul lit for every move? now, this grind demands some crystal-clear definitions. the same entity in the same sitch can’t be throwing two completely different memes. but it’s lowkey possible for a dude to be chill in one spot while his arms are doing a whole dance, or for a top to be fixed in one place while it spins on its axis. we ain’t tryna list every exception—let’s just peep that opposites can’t be doing, being, or suffering opposites in the same relation. and in the squad of opposites, we got assent versus dissent, desire versus ghosting. one type of desire is like mad thirst or hunger—and here’s a fresh twist: thirst is for a cold brew, hunger is for legit grub; not for a dope warm latte or a special kinda food, except that the fact we’re craving something means it’s automatically lit. when relative terms are stripped of extra sauce, their opposites ain’t flexing extra sauce either; and when they do have drip, their counterparts match up. like, “greater” is simply riding with “less,” and knowledge is always scoped out on some subject. but then, a specific kind of knowledge is all about a specific subject. likewise, every science got its own flavor defined by its object—medicine, for instance, is the science of health, though it ain’t the same as just being healthy.

now, after clearing that up, let’s slide back to our OG thirst example, which is clearly aiming for drink. the thirsty soul might get hit with two distinct vibes: the animalistic squad be like “drink it up,” while the rational squad be throwing a “nah, that’s a no-go.” these two impulses are straight-up at odds, so we can peep that they come from different crews in the soul. but then, is passion a totally separate squad, or just a remix of desire? check this wild story about a dude named leontius. he was cruising up from the piraeus outside the north wall and peeped a spot where executioner-dropped bodies were just chillin’. the dude got hit with a mix of mad curiosity and major revulsion; at first, he peaced out and squinted his eyes, then—boom, slamming them open—he goes, “get in on this sick view, you miserable losers!” so, ain’t that a third squad, one that usually slides in to back up reason against desire (but never the opposite)? that’s pure passion or spirit, and we can further vibe on its separate existence with this scenario: when a dude’s taking his just desserts, if he’s got a generous heart he won’t get all heated about the hardship; but if he’s getting hit with total injustice, his indignation comes in clutch—hunger and thirst can’t even tame him; the inner spirit must either go beast mode or tap out until reason, like a chill shepherd telling his dog “nah, that’s enough barking,” breaks through. this totally shows that passion is reason’s ride-or-die. but is passion just cloned from reason? nah, ‘cause passion is out here even in kids and animals; and homer even drops a truth bomb when he writes, “he smote his breast, and thus clapped back at his soul.”

and now, finally, we’re standing on solid ground to vibe that the virtues of the state and the individual are basically the same. wisdom, courage, and justice in the state are just the wisdom, courage, and justice of the peeps who make it up. each of the three squads does its own hustle in the state, and each part of the soul handles its own lane; reason, the big boss, and passion, the underdog, get straight-up balanced by the power of dope music and sick gym sessions. the counselor and the warrior, the head and the arm, link up in the “mansoul” to keep all the wild desires in check. the warrior’s courage is that killer quality that keeps him spotting dangers accurately, even when pleasure and pain are trying to mess with his vibe. the counselor’s wisdom is that tiny slice of the soul that’s got the final say and the real logic. and temperance? that’s just the solid friendship between the ruling and the laid-back squads, both in the state and in the individual. we already dropped some tea on justice; and if you peep real-life, will a just state or a just squad ever be out here thieving, lying, cheating on partners, or disrespecting gods and homies? nah, fam. and that’s ‘cause each part—whether in the state or the soul—stays in its own lane. justice is the quality that brands peeps and states as just. plus, our OG division of labor—where one dude was prepped for one specific role—was just an early teaser for what would pop off later; and now justice has gone full send, binding together the three key beats of the soul and syncing up every aspect of life. meanwhile, injustice—which is when the lesser parts go rogue and disrespect the squad—is the total opposite, all outta sync and unnatural, like a nasty bug in the soul, just like disease wrecks a body; ‘cause in both the soul and the body, the vibes you drop (good or bad) end up spawning habits that are either lit or downright trash. virtue is the glowing health, beauty, and overall well-being of the soul, while vice is the disease, weakness, and ugly glitch in the soul.

yo, the old debate pops back: which is more profesh—justice or injustice? honestly, the question is straight-up ridiculous. ‘cause injustice, like a terminal virus, makes life a total dumpster fire. roll with me up to that hill that hangs over the city and peep the one true form of virtue next to an infinite playlist of vices (including four extra special ones that are a vibe in both states and peeps). and the state that’s riding with that one, pure form of virtue is the one we’ve been chatting about—where reason rules under one of two aliases: monarchy or aristocracy. so, all in all, we got five forms for both states and souls...

in trying to prove that the soul’s split into three separate squads, plato takes a moment to break down what makes one faculty different from another. his lit criterion: different squads can’t spit out clashing memes. the same squad can’t drop totally opposite effects. but the early squad theorists got caught up in major thorny drama, and plato ain’t gonna take another step until he clears the clutter. this drags him into a tire-kicking digression meant to school us on what contradiction really is. first up, contradictions must be happening at the same time and in the same context. secondly, don’t go sprinkling random extra words into the mix when laying out these opposing vibes—for example, thirst is purely about drink, not about warm drink. he’s lowkey implying (without straight-up spelling it out) that if a dude gets stopped from guzzling—whether by cool-headed reason or the heat of anger—this proves that thirst (or the desire that holds it down) is its own squad, totally separate from anger and reason. but if we start tweaking “thirst” or “desire” into something like “angry thirst” or “revengeful desire,” then the zones of desire and anger start to merge and get all sus. so that case has to get benched. still, there’s an extra glitch with the term “good,” which is always lurking in the object of our cravings. these are the pre-logic debates, and anyone tired of this ancient brain dump should remember that it was all key to clearing up ideas during our early mental glow-up.

plato’s psychology stops at slicing the soul into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent squads—a breakdown he kicked off that even aristotle and later ethical legends kept riding with. the biggest burn in this early mind analysis is nailing down exactly where the irascible squad (the greek raw feels) fits, which can roll under names like righteous indignation, spirit, or passion. it’s the backbone of courage, including in plato’s world the kind of moral guts it takes to endure pain, crush intellectual challenges, and face down battlefield chaos. even if it’s a bit irrational, it tends to roll with the rational squad: it won’t be triggered by a fair slap of punishment; sometimes it even shows up as a hype engine that powers a dude through epic feats. think of it as the “lion heart” that lets reason seal the deal. on the flip side, it’s more of a negative vibe—it’s all indignant when faced with wrongs or fakes, but unlike love (in the symposium and phaedrus) it ain’t chasing some ultimate vision of truth or good. it’s that no-nonsense, military-grade spirit that dominates the honor game. it’s different from plain anger (the greek term), which lacks that extra righteous spark. even though aristotle kept the term in rotation, we can peep that “passion” in his world lost its hookup with the rational and basically got mashed up with anger. and nowadays, both in modern philosophy and everyday chat, words like anger or passion are almost always thrown around as bad juju—with zero cred for a legit cause behind them. the whole “righteous indignation” vibe is so hit-or-miss that we can’t really count it as its own virtue or habit. and honestly, i’m kinda iffy on plato’s idea that even someone securely roasted by justice would admit that his sentence is fair; that’s more the spirit of a true philosopher or martyr than of a common criminal.

we can peep how close plato gets to aristotle’s iconic flex, “good actions produce good habits.” his line—“as healthy practices (in greek) bring health, so do just practices bring justice”—hits off with the same wave as the nicomachean ethics. but note, an offhand comment in plato’s text leveled up into a major principle in aristotle’s whole ethical system.

now, there’s a gnarly catch in understanding what plato meant by “the longer way”: he’s hinting at some next-level metaphysics that ain’t down with just repping the principle of contradiction. in books six and seven (peep sophist and parmenides), he dropped a rough sketch of that deep metaphysical realm; but when glaucon asked for the final tea on the idea of good, plato was like, “hold up, i haven’t even hit the prelims yet.” how he would’ve filled in that sketch or debated those high-tier ideas remains all guesswork. maybe he was hunting for an a priori method to build the parts out of the whole; or maybe he was wondering which idea was the meta container for the others—maybe even tripping on that hegelian “ego equals universal” vibe. or perhaps he imagined that ideas could be built like the way we construct figures and numbers in math. for plato, the universal was the ultimate truth; he was always trying to anchor all knowledge or opinions to that one ultimate pole, just like we now try to balance everything between induction and raw experience. metaphysical aspirations have always been all about smashing past human thought and language: they seem to hit a level where they’re “vibing in unrealized worlds,” and even though those ideas hit deep in the thinker’s mind, they end up invisible or straight-up unintelligible to everyone else. so it ain’t shocking that plato himself never laid out his doctrine of ideas in a way that’s crystal clear; or that his school later on—like his squadmates glaucon and adeimantus—couldn’t keep up in that crazy realm of speculation. in the sophist, where he’s clapping back at the skeptics who claimed either that nothing can be predicated or that every label fits everything, he winds up saying that some ideas mesh with some, but not all with all. but he only took one or two steps on that path; he never fully dropped a connected system of ideas or even a deep understanding of how the basic sciences slot together.

book v.
i was about to drop the tea on the four forms of vice or decline in states when polemarchus—chilling a bit farther from me than adeimantus—grabbed him by the jacket and leaned in all lowkey, whispering, “should we let him slide?” “no way, fam,” adeimantus shot back, turning up his volume. i was like, “yo, who are you trying to let off?” “you,” he replied. why? “‘cause we think you’re not keeping it 100 with us by ghosting on women and kids, conveniently tossing them aside under that bland ‘friends share everything’ excuse.” and wasn’t i right? “yeah,” he replied, “but there are mad types of communism or community, and we need to figure out which one is the real deal. the crew, as you just peeped, is down for a deeper breakdown.” then thrasymachus jumped in, “you think we rolled up here to dig for gold, or to vibe to your long-ass lecture?” “yea, but keep it to a reasonable length,” i shot back. glaucon added, “yeah, socrates, there’s legit wisdom in spending your life debating this stuff; but please, without any more delay, break down how this community is supposed to roll, and how we fill the gap between birth and schooling.” i was like, “aight, the topic’s got mad twists—first up, what’s actually possible? that’s question one. and then, what’s hella desirable? that’s question two.” “don’t stress,” he replied, “you’re among your homies.” i clapped back, “that’s a weak consolation; i’m gonna end up offing my own squad along with me. not that i mind a little innocent LOLs, but anyone who offends the truth is straight-up murdering it.” then glaucon laughed, “so if you end up offing us, we’ll pre-acquit you, and you’ll be totally free of the guilt for straight-up deceiving us.”

socrates proceeds: the guardians of our state are meant to be like ultimate watchdogs, as we already dropped. now, dogs aren’t divided into dudes and chicks—we don’t roll out only the macho types to hunt while leaving the females home to babysit the pups. they all got the same hustle—the only diff is one squad is buff and the other is more chill. but if we want women to share the same missions as men, they’ve gotta get the same schooling—they need to learn music, gym routines, and even the art of war. i know it’s gonna be a massive meme when they start riding horses and hauling weapons; the image of naked, wrinkle-loaded oldies flexing their moves in the palaestra won’t be a look of beauty, and will probably become a legendary joke. but we can brush off the haters; remember, there was a time people were laughing at our current gym classes too. it’s all about habit: folks finally peeped that showing off in public is way better than hiding, and now the laughs have died down. only the truly evil should be roasted.

the first question: are women totally, or at least partially, able to jump into the same gigs as men? and here, some might call me inconsistent for even spitting this idea. we started out with dividing labor, and the variety of gigs was all about different vibes. but hold up—aren’t there diff vibes between men and women? nah, they’re not completely on different wavelengths, right? that was the glitch, glaucon, that made me lowkey dodge the whole fam-life chit-chat. however, when a dude’s drowning—whether in a kiddie pool or in the deep ocean—he’s only got one move: swim like your life depends on it; and we gotta figure out an escape route, if we can.

the spiel is that different vibes suit different uses, and while it’s said that men and women have diff natures, that’s basically just a verbal face-off. we’re not saying the diff is just on paper; like, a bald dude and a hairy dude might clash on one single point, but you can’t say that just ‘cause a bald guy is a cobbler, the hairy guy can’t be one. why’s that line whack? ‘cause the opposition between them is only partial—like the diff between a male physician and a female physician, not like the diff between a physician and a carpenter. and if the only diff between the sexes is that one makes the babies and the other carries them, that doesn’t prove they need separate schooling. even if women got a bit less juice than men in some areas, don’t dudes differ from each other too? hasn’t nature spread out all the dope qualities our citizens need evenly between the sexes? and even in their own specialized moves, aren’t women sometimes, even when they’re crushing it, ironically bested by men? women are in the same club as men, and they got the same potential (or lack thereof) for medicine, gym flows, or war—but maybe just on a slightly lower level. one woman might be a stellar guardian, another might not; and the best ones gotta be chosen to roll with our guardians. if their vibes are the same, then their schooling should be too; there’s nothing unnatural or impossible about a woman learning music and gym moves. and the education we dish out to them will be top-tier, far superior to that of a basic cobbler, training up the absolute best, which is a massive gain for the state. so let them strip (while staying draped in their own modesty), and jump into the war hustle and defending the nation; anyone laughing at that is just trippin’.

the first wave is done, and the argument forces us to admit that men and women share the same duties and hustles. then comes the second, even bigger wave—community of wives and kids; is that even a smart move or possible? i don’t doubt the swag of it; i’m just not so sure about the possibility. “nah, i think there’s serious doubt on both counts.” i was trying to dodge the hassle of proving the first point, but since you peeped my little stratagem, i gotta come clean. just let me let my mind roam like a lone wanderer daydreaming about what could be, and then i’ll bounce back to what can actually go down.

in the first place our top dogs are gonna enforce the laws and drop new ones whenever the squad needs it, and their ride-or-die ministers will follow the play. yo, as the legislator, you already picked the bros; now it's time to pick the hunnies. once the crew’s chosen, they’re gonna be crashing in communal cribs and chowing down together, brought together by a necessity even stronger than the certainties of math. but they can’t be allowed to live all wild and unfiltered— that's hella unholy, and our rulers are dead set on blocking that mess. so to dodge that cringe, uber sacred marriage bashes will be set up, with their holiness scaled up exactly to how useful they are. and here, glaucon, lemme ask (since i know you’re the ultimate breeder of birds and beasts), don’t you go extra with the mating game? "certainly." so why would human hookups need any less care? but then our rulers gotta be next-level state doctors, 'cause sometimes they gotta drop a heavy dose of white lies to spark the dopest unions among the people. the dope gotta roll with the dope, the trash with the trash, and the kids of the one are raised while the others get yeeted—keeping the whole flock in peak condition. marriage bash events will be scheduled with major popo potential in mind, where brides and grooms meet up; and using a slick lottery system, the rulers will make sure that the brave and the fly squad up, and that the low-tier get paired with low-tier—though the latter will just chalk it up to fate even though it’s totally the rulers’ master plan. and when babies drop, the offspring of the brave and fly get shipped off to a designated crib in a certain part of the city, where lit nurses take care of them; the rest get yeeted off to unknown drops. the mamas get scooped into the communal fold to nurse the kiddos—but there’s gotta be mad caution so none of them peep their own spawn; and if needed, extra nurses can be hired. the hassle of staying up all night watching gets passed on to attendants. "so the wives of our guardians are gonna have a chill, easy time while baby-making," i said, and that's straight-up on point.

the parents gotta be in their prime glow-up phase: for a dude, that’s around thirty years—starting at twenty-five, when his turbo-speed vibes start cooling off, up to fifty-five; and for a lady, prime is from twenty to forty. anyone outside that prime window who jumps into the marriage bashes is straight-up impious; and anyone locking down a marriage deal at off times without the rulers’ blessing is also playing with fire. this rule even applies to those in the prime zone: after that period, they can freestyle, as long as they dodge the no-go hookups between parents and kids or among siblings—though siblings might get a pass if ya score a special dispensation. "but how are we gonna figure out fam connections when everything is communal?" the answer is: siblings are just those who got popped about seven or nine months after the marriage vibes, and the parents are whoever got hitched then, with everyone having a bunch of kids and every kid repping multiple parents.

socrates drops the next tea: i gotta prove that this whole scheme is not only fire but totally in sync with our entire squad’s vibe. the ultimate win for a state is its unity; the worst fail is mad discord and constant distractions. unity is lit when there’s zero room for personal clout, private feels, or selfish agendas—if one squad member hurts, the whole crew feels it; if one citizen’s in pain, everyone’s on high alert; even the tiniest bruise to the state’s vibe sends shockwaves through the entire body and straight into the soul. like a true squad, when one part takes a hit, the whole gang suffers. every state’s got its peeps and its bosses—where in a democracy they’re called rulers, and in other hoods they might be dubbed masters—but in our state, they’re our saviors and ride-or-die allies; and the folks who elsewhere get labelled as slaves are, here, our nurturers and dime-droppers, while the ones known as comrades and colleagues in other circles are our fathers and bros. and while in other states some squad members might see one as a pal and another as a rival, in our state no one’s a stranger; every citizen’s linked by deep blood ties, and words like brother, father, sister, and mother, pumped into kids from day one, ain’t just empty labels. plus, when everyone’s sharing property, they share every joy and heartbreak together.

yo, can there ever be beef among a squad that’s vibing on the same wavelength? or legal drama about property when all you own is your own body? or lawsuits about throwing punches when everyone’s gotta have each other’s back? letting someone strike back when dissed will be the ultimate clapback to knife threats and keep the state’s peace on lock. but no young buck’s ever allowed to throw hands with an elder; mad respect stops that vibe, and he’ll know his fam's gonna come for him if he slips up. plus, our citizens will be free from life’s petty evils; no extra brown-nosing for the rich, no whack household drama, no borrowing and then ghosting on the payments. compared to other states, our crew will be the olympic champs, stacked with blessings—getting top-tier care in life and scoring an epic, honorable burial after death. and check it: the individual’s happiness ain’t sacrificed for the state’s hype; our olympic victor isn’t reduced to a humble cobbler, but is living a joy that’s next-level compared to any cobbler’s life. and if some extra cocky youth starts dreaming about snatching the state for himself, he’s gotta get schooled that "half is better than the whole." i'd straight-up tell him to chill in his lane when he already has the promise of that brave life.

so, can a squad like this even exist? like, if animals can roll as one, why can't humans? and if it’s possible, how the heck? when it comes to war, no sweat—the whole communism vibe fits right into military service. parents will take their mini-me's to peep battles, just like pottery kids learn the craft by watching the wheel spin. and honestly, the sight of their young warriors in action will level up the parents’ own courage. young fighters gotta learn the hustle, but they shouldn’t be running headfirst into danger—'cause a bit of risk is cool when the payoff is epic. these young ones should be handed off to seasoned veterans as mentors, and they gotta have wings—basically, fast, reliable steeds to bounce on and escape when shit goes down. one of the first boss moves is teaching a kid how to ride, plain and simple.

cowards and deserters are gonna get downgraded to the peasant class; and gentlemen who let themselves get captured might as well be handed over to the enemy, no cap. but what about the hero? first, he gets crowned by all the young guns in the army; next, he earns the ultimate right-hand of fellowship; and finally, why not throw some kisses his way? we already locked in that he’s gonna snag more wives than the rest, to max out his baby generator. at his feasts, he’s gonna be served extra grub—we even got homer hyping up brave men with “long chines,” which is the perfect compliment 'cause meat is pure power fuel. load up the bowls and save the prime seats and bomb eats for the brave—bless them hardcore! and any hero who drops in battle gets declared part of the golden squad instantly, and, as we believe, turns into one of hesiod’s guardian angels. he gets worshipped after death following oracle-approved rituals; and not just him, but every state benefactor who passes on in any other way lands the same mega honors.

now, how are we gonna treat our haters? should we enslave the hellenes? hell no—there’s a major risk that the whole race could end up under barbarian control. or should we loot the dead? absolutely not; that shady move has wrecked too many armies before. it’s petty AF to mess with a dead body when its soul already yeeted out—like a dog who can’t get at his attackers and ends up beefing with the stones thrown at him instead. also, hellenes’ weapons shouldn’t be tossed into the gods’ temples—they’re a straight-up pollution, 'cause they come from our own crew. on the same vibe, there should be a hard cap on how much havoc you can wreck in hellenic turf—no torching homes and only a limited haul of the annual crop should be swiped. war splits into two flavors: civil and foreign; the first is basically just nonstop discord, while the second is legit warfare—and war between hellenes is really just family drama, which is always seen as unpatriotic and totally off-key. it should be squashed with a true phil-hellenic vibe, like a fam that disciplines without completely canceling one of its own. the war isn’t on an entire nation of chill folks (men, women, and kids), just on a few bad apples; once those scrubbers get clocked, peace levels back up. that’s the way hellenes should handle beef—with each other and with barbarians, just like they do now.

"but, my dear socrates, you're lowkey skipping the real tea: is such a state even possible? i vibe with everything you say about the squad being one lit fam—dads, bros, moms, and daughters rolling off to war together; but i gotta know if this ideal state is even doable." you're being savage, fr. i barely dodged wave one and two, and now you're gonna YOLO me with the third. when that mega wave hits, i was expecting some pity, but you're straight-up "not a whit."

alright, so we ended up crafting our dream state while chasing justice, and the just dude totally vibes with that just state. but is our ideal sketch any less dope just 'cause it's kinda unreal? would a pic of a flawless human be any less fire just 'cause no one’s been that snatched IRL? can any real-life scene ever match the idea? nature's like, words will never hit perfection; but if i wanna get our state dream in motion even a bit, i think we can level it up with one or two, not minor but major, tweaks to our current state setup. i’d consolidate them into one mega state—the great wave, as i call it. until kings vibe as philosophers, or philosophers rock as kings, our cities will forever be hit with bad juju—nah, not just the cities but the whole human squad; and our ideal state will forever remain a dream. i know this is a hard pill to swallow, which not many can handle. "socrates, the whole world is gonna rip off his jacket and come at you with sticks and stones, so dude, you better prep an answer." "you got me into this mess," i said. "and i was right," he replied; "but imma stick with you as that chill, do-nothing, well-meaning ally." with a champion like that by my side, i’ll do everything i can to hold my ground. first, though, i gotta break down who i'm talking about when i say these folks are meant to be the philosophers and rulers. since you're all about that pleasure life, you remember how random lovers are with their crushes—they love everybody and can flip flaws into fresh vibes. the snub-nosed youth is said to have that winning charm; another dude’s beak gives him a royal flex; the featureless are pure perfection; the dark-skinned bring that manly edge, while the fair ones are straight-up angels; and even the sickly get a cute nickname invented just for them—"honey-pale." wine lovers and ambition chasers also want their crushes in every style. now here’s the kicker: the philosopher is, at heart, a knowledge freak too; he’s got an insatiable curiosity for every form of knowledge. "but does mad curiosity really make a philosopher? like, are those who vibe with every sound and light at the dionysiac fests actual philosophers?" nah, they’re just vibe imitators. "so how do we call the true ones?"

you’d totally vibe with the idea that abstract drips like justice, beauty, good, and evil are real—even though each is one epic idea on its own, when you remix them they seem like a whole squad. those who really peep these deep truths are the true philosophers; while the rest just catch sounds and see colors, know the arts, but never hit that ultra-woke vision of absolute justice, beauty, or truth—they got the dim glow of opinion, not the full beam of knowledge, and what they see is just a half-awake daydream. maybe that crew we just talked about will get heated about it; can we chill them without exposing the crazy chaos in their minds? suppose we say that if someone’s packing real knowledge, we're hyped to hear it, but knowledge always has to be about something that truly is, whereas ignorance is all about what isn’t; and then there’s this third vibe that’s both there and not there, purely an opinion. so opinion and knowledge, since they’re about different things, gotta be separate powers. by powers, i mean those unseen forces that you can only tell apart by what they’re about—just like opinion is prone to mistakes, while knowledge is straight-up flawless and the mightiest vibe of all. if being is the target of knowledge and non-being is the playground of ignorance, then opinion sits right between them, darker than pure knowledge but brighter than total nothingness. this in-between or contingent matter is both in and out at the same time, flexing both existence and non-existence. now i gotta ask my good friend, who disses abstract beauty and justice and is all about a multitude of beautiful and just vibes, does he really see that everything can flip depending on the angle—the beautiful turning ugly, the pious flipping to impious, the just turning unjust? isn’t double sometimes just half, and aren’t heavy and light just relative vibes that slide into one another? everything is both here and not here, like that old riddle—"a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a bird with a stone and not a stone." the mind can’t lock onto one flavor; these fuzzy, in-between, half-lit vibes that bounce around in the zone between being and not-being are where opinions live, while the unchanging, solid truths are where real knowledge hangs out. and anyone stuck groveling deep in sensory chaos, with only that murky perception, ain’t a philosopher—they’re just riding the opinion train.

book five is like the fresh drop in the republic saga, where first the crew locks down communal property and family vibes, and then rolls into the kingdom of philosophers. plato’s been lowkey setting up this dream in some offhand words in book iv that just flew over most heads—like they were meant for glaucon and adeimantus to catch on. the "paradoxes" (as our boi morgenstern calls 'em) in this republic chapter are gonna be saved for another time; just a few style notes and quick fixes for any hang-ups need to be dropped here.

first up, picture the waves—this epic image lays out the game plan for the book. the first wave, the second wave, and then the colossal third wave roll in, and you can literally hear their thunderous roar. all of the extra flair in plato’s wild proposals was pre-anticipated by the dude himself. nothing is as dope as the chill hesitation he drops when he says, "until kings are philosophers," and all that deep stuff; or the flip from sublime to outright ridiculous, when glaucon describes how humanity’s gonna react to this fresh truth.

looking closer, some glitches pop up in this communistic plan. they never really spill the deets on how communism vibes with the lower classes; and the breakdown of forbidden family degrees is mad fuzzy. it’s totally possible a kid born at one marriage bash might end up marrying one of their own siblings—or even one of their parents—at a later bash. plato’s hella wary of incest vibes, but at the same time he avoids throwing in the fact that the city would split up into fams based on who popped out seven or nine months after each wedding party. if we were to seriously roast these wild ideas, we might say that while all the old blood ties get axed, the newly banned ones are based solely on the random chance of kids being born in the same month and year—pretty arbitrary, right? plus, he never really explains how the lottery system could be manipulated to pair up the flyest and dopest. that quirky term "five-and-twenty" might even be a throwback line from some ancient poet.

in laying out what a philosopher is, plato drops love-fueled analogies that vibe more with glaucon—the athenian pleasure seeker—than with our modern feels. they’re partly cheeky fun but also drop some real truth bombs. the idea that science is a complete package remains a solid principle in both hardcore inductive and metaphysical philosophy; and that endless thirst for universal knowledge is still the signature move of every true philosopher, ancient or modern—no cap.

wrapping up book five, plato introduces the concept of contingent matter—a wild idea that’s later had a massive impact on modern ethics and theology—which shows up here for the first time in philosophy. he didn’t point out that the layers of knowledge in a subject don’t have a matching vibe in the actual object. for plato, every word must answer to an idea; he couldn’t even imagine an opinion that was just an opinion about nothing. his love for analogies led him to create "parallels and conjugates" and overlook some obvious deets. to us, some of his brain farts seem confusing only because they’re so straightforward—we totally miss that the answers are practically tumbling out at our feet. for early thinkers, the idea of not-being was a dark and mysterious void—they didn’t peep that this terrifying specter, threatening to wreck all knowledge, was merely a logical move. and then, by lumping together two totally different ideas with the same word through a slip of language, the confusion got real. so in the ambiguous world of (greek) plato, where he was trying to bring order to the chaos of early thought, he ended up mixing up perception with opinion and failing to separate the contingent from the relative. in the theaetetus, the first of these glitches starts getting sorted; in the sophist, the next one; which is why these two dialogues are probably seen as coming in later than the republic.

book vi. having peeped that the masses don’t even vibe with true being – they got zero filters for justice, beauty, or truth – while philosopher homies are flexin’ those perfect blueprints, we now gotta ask: should the squad of brainiac kings or the basic many run our state? like, no cap, who’d ever doubt that philosophers deserve the crown if they’re loaded with every savage quality a ruler needs? they’re all about that eternal drip of knowledge and raw truth; they straight-up ghost falsehood; their basic, low-key desires get yeeted when knowledge is on deck; they’re front-row spectators to all time and all flexes of existence; and when they’re bathing in that epic contemplation, human life is just extra AF—and death? not even a jump scare. plus, they’re super social, mad gracious, and don’t catch any lame vibes of cowardice or clout-chasing arrogance. they soak up knowledge like dank memes go viral, rock well-tuned, synced-up minds, and truth just streams into them like a constant loop of bop beats. can even the god of jealousy throw a single side-eye at a crew stacked with such dope qualities?

here adeimantus chimes in:—“no dude can answer you, socrates; but everyone’s feeling like it’s just your weak argument game bussin’ off shifts. one minute you’re droppin’ facts here, the next you’re straight-up dead in the water—kind of like a noob at checkers gettin’ clapped by a pro. and yet, lowkey, you might still be right. you might peep that those who turn philosophy into their whole lifestyle sometimes end up as hoodlums if they’re shady, or total memes if they’re actually good people. what’s your take?” i’m like, bet, he’s deadass right. “then how does that square with the whole idea that philosophers should be the kings?” 

i’mma hit you with a parable, fam, which also shows just how trash i am at making allegories. the vibes between good peeps and their governments are so wild, that to back ‘em up i gotta pull an example straight outta fiction. picture this: the captain of a ship, towering a whole head and shoulders above the crew, but lowkey he’s a little deaf, a bit blind, and doesn’t even know ship life 101. the sailors wanna grab the steering wheel even though they’re clueless about the craft—they’re convinced that the art of sailing can’t be learned anyway. if they get denied the helm, they slip the captain his posset, tie him up like a noob in a round of minecraft, and yeet him off the ship. anyone vibing with that mutiny gets crowned a “good pilot” and all that jazz; they don’t even clock that the legit pilot’s gotta peep the winds and stars and boss ‘em around, whether they’re ready to serve or not—such a dude, in their eyes, becomes nothing more than a fool, a chatterbox, a star-gazer. so here’s my parable; i’m begging you to spill this tea to the boomer crew who ask why the philosopher’s got such a sus nickname, and to school ‘em that it ain’t him—it’s the clout chasers who refuse to use him right that are to blame for his wasted drip. the philosopher shouldn’t be begging humans to hand him the keys to power. the true wise guy ain’t chasing the rich for status like some old proverb, but every person—rich or broke—needs to hit up the doc when in a pinch. in this mix, the pilot is the philosopher—called star-gazer by the parable’s normies, while the mutinous sailors are none other than the trash tier politicos who end up wrecking his genius. and yo, it ain’t even that these politicos are the ultimate haters of philosophy—she gets dissed even more by her own clout-lost kids when they catch world corruption. remember the OG vibe of the philosopher? did we not just say he vibes solely with truth and straight-up ghosts falsehood, that he can’t even chill in the noisy chaos of everyday illusions, but is magnetically drawn by his own inner resonance to peep the absolute? it’s like, every virtue and that solid truth, with its leader, set up camp in his soul. but, as you were peeping, if we flip the script and scope the reality, we see that aside from a tiny, useless lag in the system, most of these described peeps are literally total rogues.

now, let’s spill the tea on where all this corruption in nature comes from. everyone’s lowkey agree that the philosopher as we described him is a rare, lit being. but dang, so many wild vibes come through to straight-up wreck these rare gems! literally, no dope thing can’t flip into a major mess—health, wealth, strength, clout, even virtues themselves can turn toxic when the scene’s off. just like in the animal or plant kingdom where the dopest seeds need bomb-ass air and soil to thrive, the best human characters turn into trash if they land on weak ground; meanwhile, the weak AF rarely pull off any epic moves or legendary fails—they ain’t the ingredients for either big-time villains or heroic legends. the philosopher rides the same wave: he’s either the absolute goat or the biggest cringe-ever. some call the sophists the real corruptors of youth; but fr, isn’t public opinion the true sophist, lurking in every corner—in the squads, in assemblies, in courts, in camps, in all the claps and hisses echoing off the hills? ain’t you gonna see a young heart burst off with feels amid all that noisy chaos? and really, can any education actually stop him from gettin’ swept away by the tidal wave? and that’s not it. if a guy refuses to cave to popular opinion, then brace yourself for the subtle, gentle compulsion of exile or even death. what clout of rival sophists or any other voice could even beat that uneven challenge? sure, there might be some next-level, more-than-human characters who are exceptions—god might save a dude, but he can’t save his own clout. also, peep this: the hired sophist is just the echo chamber for everyone’s own opinions; he’s basically the hype-man for the monster, knowin’ how to either butter it up or flame it, and he’s tuned in to the deep, inarticulate grunts of the beast. what’s good is what hypest it up, and evil is what gets it shook; truth and beauty, in its eyes, are just flavors dictated by brute taste. that’s the sophist’s “wisdom,” and that’s the condition for those who let public opinion be the ultimate judge of truth in both art and morals. they’re cursed to be doing exactly what society approves of, and when they try to drop the fundamentals, the flop is so epic it’s downright ludicrous. think on that, and ask yourself: is the world more likely to stan the unity of a singular, dope idea, or the tangled mess of a million random phenomena? and if the world ain’t vibing with that singular idea, then it can’t really be philosophical—it’s gotta be out here persecuting real philosophers. and yo, here’s another hot mess: the world just can’t handle letting go of its gifted nature, so they end up buttering up the young (alcibiades) into thinking he’s mega talented; the tall, proper youth starts to expand, dreaming of kingdoms and epic empires. if, at that moment, a friend leans in whispering, “yo, now the gods got you lit; you’re one epic fool and need some schooling”—do you really reckon he’ll even listen? or imagine a higher-key, premium dude who’s vibing with philosophy—isn’t it inevitable that the world will flex herculean moves to spoil and corrupt him? aren’t we deadass saying that the love of knowledge, just like the love of mad clout, can send a dude off course? dudes like this (critias) often dive into politicking—they become the architects of massive state drama, sometimes causing wild chaos, sometimes even dropping epic good vibes. and so, philosophy gets straight-up ghosted by its own natural protectors, while random, trashy intruders roll in and drag her reputation down. basic, small minds see the open land like a free pass and bolt from the arts’ prison right into her temple. a slick mechanic, with a soul as rough as his worn-out rig, thinks he’ll level up by sliding into her DMs as a suitor. ‘cause even in her fallen state, philosophy retains her own fire—and he, like some scrappy, bald blacksmith’s apprentice hustlin’ to escape the clutches of durance, cleans up like a fresh bridegroom and even weds his boss’s daughter. what’s the tea on the offspring of such hookups? won’t they turn out all vile and bastardized, totally devoid of truth and natural vibes? “they will,” no cap. so, the genuine squad of philosophers is hella slim; maybe there’s a few holding it down in tiny states where politicking ain’t even a flex, or some who got held back by theages’ weak bridle of bad health—like, my own oracular sign is nearly one-in-a-million, mad rare to even mention. and those few, once they’ve sipped on the lit nectar of philosophy and scoped that den of thieves and jungle of wild beasts we call human existence, will bounce out to chill under a wall’s cover, preserving their pure vibes and ghosting the storm in peace. “that, my friend, is a major score.” major, yes, but not the ultimate clout—‘cause humans are social creatures, and they only hit their peak glow when they’re vibing in a society built just for them.

alright, enough spillin’ the tea on why philosophy’s got such a sus rep. next up: which of the game states is even down with her vibe? honestly, none. right now she’s like some exotic seed that straight-up degenerates in a whack-ass, alien soil; she’ll only flex her epic, heavenly growth in her proper crib. “and is her proper crib ours or someone else’s?” ours on every level except for one tiny snag that’s still up in the air. remember when we dropped that states need a living, breathing witness of the lawmaker’s vibe? we were lowkey shook to dive into that deep-ass convo, and now that question’s back, still hella tricky: how can philosophy be studied without catchin’ a load of haters? let’s drag her into the daylight, fam, and finally wrap up this epic inquiry.

first off, i’mma say it bold: nothing is worse than how philosophy’s being handled right now. most peeps snag a little philosophy in their early days during the breaks, but they never catch on to the real challenge—which is that gnarly art of dialectic. later on, maybe they pop into a philosophy lecture every now and then. years roll by, and the sun of philosophy, unlike heracleitus’s wild vibes, sets and never comes back to blaze. this whole education hustle should get flipped; it should start with some dope mental gymnastics in youth, and as a dude gets swole, he should pump up the gym time for his soul. then, when the grind of active life is over, he can finally slide back into philosophy. “socrates, you’re for real, but the world’s gonna be just as lit in clashing with you—no more than thrasymachus.” don’t even start a beef between thrasymachus and me, ‘cause we were never on that clout war and are now straight-up besties. i’ll hustle hard to school him and all of humanity on the straight-up truth of my words, or at least get us prepped for when, in the next life, we can drop similar deep dives. “that’ll be a minute from now”—not long when you’re talking eternity. the masses will probably stay hella skeptical, ‘cause they’ve never peeped that natural unity of ideas—they only see curated mashups; not raw, free vibes, but just controversy stunts and legal clapbacks; a perfect guy running a perfect state is a vibe they’ve never even witnessed. and we peeped early on that there’s zero chance for perfection in states or individuals until philosophers—nah, not the shady ones, but the so-called useless class—are forced into the game; or until kings’ sons catch that true love for philosophy. whether in the infinite past there was, or in some far-out land there is, or ever will be an ideal state as we envisioned, we straight-up maintain that there has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the muse of philosophy is in the driver’s seat. you tryna say the world’s on some other wavelength? oh, my dude, don’t come for the world! they’ll switch up their take soon if you give ‘em the low-key deets on what a real philosopher’s about. who can hate a guy who’s all about love? or be jelly on someone who’s completely free of envy? peep this again: the many ain’t dissing the true philosopher—they’re throwing shade at the fake ones, those posers who crash the party uninvited and only chat about random peeps instead of dropping solid principles, which is so off-brand for real philosophy. ‘cause the true philosopher ain’t about petty street beef; his vision’s laser-locked on that eternal order and he’s busy molding himself (and others) into that divine drip, crafting both private and public vibes. when humanity peeps that state happiness is only found in that divine model, will they be salty with us for trying to sketch it? “for sure not. but how we gonna sketch it?” the creative genius won’t lift a brush until he’s sliced the canvas clean—a tabula rasa. on that blank slate, he’s gonna inscribe the constitution of a state, always peeping the divine truth of nature, and from that, he’s whippin’ up the godlike among men, mixing the two flows, erasing the old and painting in the new, until there’s a flawless fusion of divine and human vibes. but yo, maybe the world’s gonna flex and doubt that such an artist even exists. doubt what, exactly? that the philosopher is a true truth-lover with a vibe that’s next level?—and if they’re cool with that, will they still be salty about crowning philosophers as kings? “bro, they’d be less heated.” so, let’s assume they cool down a bit. still, someone might pause on whether a king’s son can really be a philosopher. and we ain’t gonna front: they’re mad prone to corruption; but still, over the ages, maybe one epic exception might drop—and one lit exception is all it takes. if even one king’s son becomes a true philosopher, backed by a squad of ride-or-die citizens, he might just level up and create that ideal polity. hence, we lock in the verdict: our laws aren’t just the dopest—they’re totally possible, even if the grind ain’t free from hustle.



yo, i didn't score any extra flex by ghosting all those messy q's about women and kids. time to get sagas and admit: we gotta deep dive into another fire question – how the hell do we educate our ride-or-die guardians? we were all like, "they gotta stan their country" and get roasted in the spicy combo of joy and pain so that the ones who come out pure and straight flexin’ on their values snatch major honors and rewards in this life and the afterlife. but then, the convo pulled a stealth mode, threw on a veil, and slid into a whole new vibe.

i was lowkey shook about dropping my claim – but bet, i'm about to risk it: our guardians need to be straight-up philosophers. remember those conflicting vibes that run through a true philosopher? like, how the heck do you cram all that drip into one homie! brains and hustle don’t usually jam with staying chill; that tough af, no-fear persona is usually low on academic grind. but still, we need all those wild contradictions, so as we peeped earlier, the wannabes gotta be put through the ultimate drip test on fun and danger – and now, on top of that, in the ultra-high tiers of knowledge.

y'all remember when we busted about the virtues, dropping hints about that extra-long grind, which you just dipped on cuz it looked too extra. like, "bet, that's enough said." but yo, what's "enough" when there’s still a bunch of fire left to secure? a guardian can’t just tap out on the truth chase – he gotta be down for the ultra-long trek, or he’ll never peak and hit that next-level zone beyond the basic four virtues. and he can’t just skim the basics either; he needs a crystal-clear full frame view. (wtf, it's wild how we sweat the small stuff but ghost on the epic truth, right?)

so, "what’s the mega-high-level?" and you actin’ like you missed my constant tea on the idea of good – that elusive drip we know mad little about, because even if a dude rakes in the whole world, without that real good vibe, it's all just empty clout! some peeps be trippin’ that good is straight-up wisdom; but that spins you into a never-ending circle – like, they say good equals wisdom, and wisdom’s all about good. then others be like, nah, good is pure pleasure; but then that wild logic would mean there’s bad pleasure too, and suddenly the whole good vibe is sus. plus, the true good’s gotta be the real deal – a dude might chase virtue looks for clout, but he’d never chase fake good energy. so, should our guardians be left clueless about this supreme main principle that everyone lowkey senses, and without which no one can truly flex their brain power?

"but, socrates, what's this supreme vibe – knowledge, pleasure, or what?" you snap, calling me extra for always borrowing from the squad instead of dropping my own heat. can i even spit truth when i ain't got 100 on the deets? "yo, drop your take." but fr, are you cool with being stuck in sketchy, off-key opinions when you could be rocking that lit, certified science glow? "just gimme an explanation of good like you did for temperance and justice." fam, i’d love to, but right now my vibe just isn’t reaching that next-level peak of good knowledge.

i can’t drop you straight to the big boss, but i sure can vibe with the mini-me in his image – kinda like the interest stacking up on your principal, no cap. (make sure your accounts are audited, and i ain't tryna hit you with fake receipts.) remember when we split the squad into the many beautiful ones and the one ultimate beauty, the particular vs. the universal, the stuff you can peep vs. the deep-thought flex? ever consider that seeing is lowkey the most extra and pricey sense – it needs not just dope objects, but a legit medium, which is light; without that, your eyes are just squinting at a blank canvas.

'cause, fr, light is that bomb connector between our peepers and the things we scope, and the ultimate giver of that glow is the sun – the original daytime eye, but don’t mix it up with a human eye, aight? that daytime eye, or sun, is what i call the child of good, vibing with the visible world just like the good vibes light up the intellectual realm. when the sun’s on fleek, the eyes peep, and in the brainy kingdom where truth chills, there’s mad sight and glow.

check it: the sun for all the brainy homies is the idea of good – the main engine behind knowledge and truth – but it’s next level, a glow-up way above the basics, holding that same bond as the sun does with its light. oh, that mind-blowing peak of beauty, soaring above the mundane knowledge and even basic truth! ("you can’t be saying that good is just pleasure, right?" he snaps. chill, i replied.) and like the sun, the idea of good sparks all growth – it’s not just the producer of knowledge, but the creator of being itself, flexing way above both in ultimate dignity and power.

"yo, that's some extra deep brain gymnastics – too cosmic for us mere mortals; but fam, keep riding that image, 'cause i bet there's mad extra behind it." and so, peep this: we got two suns, two main principles. imagine their corresponding realms – one in the visible hood, the other in the mental zone. picture a line split into two parts – one larger, one smaller – and then break each part into even tinier segments that rep the different levels of knowledge in each realm. the bottom slice of the visible world is just shadows and reflections, while its top, tighter slice houses the real deal – the legit objects of nature and art. the intelligible sphere splits too – one section is math, where there’s no real ascent, just a straight slide downward; it’s not about digging deep into premises, just spitting out inferences. here, the mind jams with numbers and figures, whose images aren’t snagged from shadows but from true objects, even if you can only peep their real truth with your mental eye – and they roll in as hot hypotheses without deep analysis.

meanwhile, in the other lane, reason uses those hypotheses as stepping stones on the glow-up journey to the idea of good – locking them down, then sliding back, staying firmly in the kingdom of pure ideas both on the ascent and descent, finally settling in them. "yo, i get what you're saying," he replied; "so you're saying that the brainy ideas of science beat those half-baked, metaphorical vibes of geometry and the other arts – no matter what label you slap on 'em – and you ain't cool with treating those latter concepts as pure brain fuel 'cause they lack an original foundation, even though when they do kick off from a first principle, they level up to the higher zone." facts, i told him.

and now, assign those four clutches of knowledge their matching mental squads – pure intelligence rules the top shelf; active intelligence takes the second slot; the third gets faith; and the fourth handles the shadow peep – with each squad’s clarity in perfect ratio to the realness of the stuff they're linked to.

just like socrates, let's rejig the epic virtues of the philosopher. in vibes that stretch beyond the old school era, he gets dubbed "the spectator of all time and all existence." this dude’s rocking nature’s dopest gifts and maxes them out to the extreme. every single desire in him is absorbed into a mad love for wisdom – basically, riding that truth wave. he’s got every grace of a dope soul on deck; death doesn’t faze him, and he doesn't overhype mortal life. nowadays, the ideal vibe ain't as straightforward as in the old-school classics; the raw originality in truth or even in flops that the greeks pulsed on just isn’t the same. the modern philosopher isn’t ghosting in some hidden realm, nor is some oracle out here dropping divine mic drops to school humanity on being clueless; he ain't even treating knowledge as that step-up system climaxing in the idea of good.

the hype for the truth chase has kinda deflated; there's way more splitting up of roles and way less deep, total reflection on nature and life as one big picture; more on-point observation and less dreamy anticipation and inspo. still, even with the knowledge game flipped, the parallel isn’t totally lost – there’s room to remix plato’s blueprint into our century’s lingo. the modern philosopher is that one boss who locks onto nature's laws in full sequence and connection – not just random nature snapshots; he’s about history over drama; he digs truths that only a few crew members vibe with, not the watered-down opinions of the masses. he knows the importance of "sorting stuff according to nature" and does his best to "split science’s limbs without breaking 'em" (phaedr, no cap). no piece of truth – whether epic or tiny – gets dissed by him; even in the smallest deets he peeps massive value (parmen dropped that knowledge). like the ancient homie, he sees the world lit up with analogies, but he can also break down why sometimes one dope example is enough to spark a full induction (mill’s logic), while other times a thousand reps wouldn’t even cut it. he only deep dives into one slice of knowledge 'cause the whole pie’s too vast for one brain or one lifetime.

just like plato, he’s got a vision of knowledge as one dope united squad – not just the beginner level you get from crunching basic math, but the far-out endgame reached by countless minds across ages. he knows math is a pregame for almost every other flex; still, he won’t turn every form of knowledge into a math problem. he’s gotta have that noble, high-key character, 'cause without it, even a genius loses half its epicness. scoping the world as a tiny dot in an endless cosmic chain and each person as just another link, he doesn’t overhype his own life or get shook by death.

adeimantus first throws shade at the socratic style, lowkey flexing that plato knew his method wasn’t all smooth. he calls out, like any modern logician would, "you extract answers coz you know how to drop the questions." in a long debate, words tend to flip their meanings, with premises assumed or conclusions dropped with way too much swagger; these tiny shifts might slide under the radar until—bam!—the gap becomes huge. that’s why trying to slap arithmetic or algebra on logic is a total flop. the higher, more elastic vibe of language means words just can’t be as tight as numbers or symbols, and that extra wiggle room kinda weakens arguments that take tons of steps.

even though socrates clapped back at that in this go-around, it still makes you peep a deeper reflection on his whole questioning vibe. and here, like elsewhere, plato’s lowkey hinting that the days of the negative, all-questions approach gotta get leveled up to a more positive, constructive flow – something he starts flexing in his later dialogues.

adeimantus then goes off, saying that the ideal is totally off-key with real-life facts – 'cause experience shows that philosophers end up being either straight-up useless or sneaky rogues. defying all odds, socrates doesn’t front on that; he straight admits it and drops an allegory to explain the anomaly, even lowkey roasting his own inventive powers. in that story, the common peeps get split from the career politicos, and, as usual, socrates uses a pity vibe instead of harsh disses – painting a picture of "the noble captain who's not exactly quick on the uptake."

the whole uselessness of philosophers boils down to the fact that humanity just won’t use them. throughout all ages, the world splits between those who throw shade and fear anyone rocking mighty ideas without extra muscle. regarding the fake philosopher, socrates argues that the best gets hit hardest by corruption; and those delicate, high-key noble natures are way more likely to get messed up by off-the-wall conditions.

and yo, it’s clear that some types of excellence come straight from a super delicate constitution – like the poetic and imaginative vibes that depend on subtle impressions and can only breathe in just the right kind of atmosphere.

a genius has wild levels of pain and pleasure, massive strengths and epic flaws, and often a more dramatic character flex than your average joe. they can rock the look of virtue or selflessness without actually having it, or hide personal beef behind a mask of patriotism and philosophy – dropping that truth bomb that everyone’s lowkey thinking. an alcibiades, a mirabeau, or a napoleon the first are literally born either to drop major state evils or, if they vibe right, spark monumental good.

but yo, that whole "corruptio optimi pessima" vibe (the corruption of the best is the worst) isn’t a one-size-fits-all—it's all about what type of excellence we're talking about. the wild, off-the-wall conditions that wreck one vibe might actually be the secret sauce for another's culture. generally, a person can only fully level up in a squad or fam that vibes with them. yet sometimes, the haters and tough times can ignite such a big fire that they flip the script and upgrade the adverse vibes entirely.

while the more basic or roughneck types might squeeze some good out of a dumpster state – say, a corrupt church or society – and keep chilling by letting the dirt fly, the top-tier, delicate peeps might end up getting totally crushed or warped by that toxic scene. they could flip between hating humanity and being extra philanthropic; or sometimes, like the OG founders of monastic orders or reformers, thanks to some wild trait in them or their era, they might yeet themselves completely out of the world and even the church, sometimes sparking massive good, sometimes wild evil, sometimes a mix. and the same lowkey truth rolls out even in smaller settings like convents, schools, or families.

plato wants us to peep how fast the dopest natures get overpowered by public opinion, and how everyone’s out here hustling to snatch them up. the world, the church, your own grind, any political or party crew—they’re all dragging these legends down and flipping their high and holy labels to match their own biased runs. that monster corp they ride with straight-up decides that right and truth are just about the community’s overall vibe. the individual eventually merges with his crew; or if he tries to bounce, the world’s just too extra for him and will eventually serve that revenge. this might seem one-sided, but it’s not total cap when you scope how peeps roll when they all sit down together at a sesh, whether ancient or modern.

when politics wreck the high-key vibes, the bottom-tier peeps swoop in to claim the empty throne of philosophy. this gets laid out in that constant image where the argument—using a classic plato expression—"veils itself," popping in and out like a stealth mode meme. the big q here is: why do citizens lowkey hate philosophy? simple—they don’t even know her. but yo, there’s always a smarter squad hiding among the masses; they’d totally vibe with it if they got schooled. so far, though, they only peep a basic, knockoff version of philosophy – empty words without real depth, lifeless systems; like a (divine) being droppin’ beauty and freedom vibes, the ultimate homie in deep communion with the eternal, trying to blueprint the state in that image—which is totally new to them. this double-edged feel about the mass always goes down in two beats: first, people are seen as enemies of truth and right; second, that vibe just comes from a hot mess of accidental confusion, meaning they don’t really hate those who care about them, if only they got the right edu-drip.

in the latter vibes of book six, we gotta break down three major q's: first, what’s up with that extra-long, twisty path versus the short, kinda sus method from book four; second, what’s the divine blueprint or vibe of the state; and third, how do the splits in knowledge link up with the corresponding squads in the soul.

1. regarding plato’s high-key method for leveling up knowledge, we only catch a quick sneak peek. neither in this text nor in phaedrus, symposium, philebus, or sophist does he break down his process crystal clear. he’d probably say his method is all about stepping up in regular moves to cook a universal system of knowledge – deducing the parts from the whole instead of building the whole from the pieces. this ideal logic isn’t what he drops when chasing justice or breaking down the soul’s parts; there, just like aristotle in the nicomachean ethics, he’s all about experience and everyday lingo. but by the end of book six, he dreams up another, more perfect method where every idea is just a level, a gradation in thought, linking into a tight, self-hyped squad where consistency is the lit test for truth. he doesn’t break down the process in full detail though; like a bunch of deep thinkers both then and now, his mind’s packed with an empty blueprint he can’t quite unlock. he’s rushing toward the "end of the intellectual world" without even hitting the starting line.

2. in our modern era, we hardly need a reminder that the process of stacking knowledge here gets all mixed up with peeping at absolute, next-level truth. in every branch of science, a priori and a posteriori truths are vibing together in varying proportions. the a priori deets come from those universal experiences or what everyone’s down with; the a posteriori grows organically around those broad principles until they blend almost unnoticed. but plato, big brain as he is, messes up by thinking the final mix (synthesis) can be split from the breakdown (analysis), or that the scientific method can actually predict science itself. when he entertains that vision of a priori knowledge, he’s kinda on point – or at least his vibe gets echoed by the moves of descartes, kant, hegel, and even bacon in modern philosophy. those prophetic "glimpses of truth" about man or nature stand in the same lane to ancient philosophy as hypotheses do in today’s inductive science. and let's not even front that in ancient times, if philosophy was strictly locked to the results of experience, knowledge would’ve been totally frozen and the human brain left without its legit thinking tools.



2. plato’s like, when the slate is totally blank and ready for some serious glow-up, the artist is gonna flex by doodling the perfect drip of the ideal state. is this some pre-dropped, heavenly blueprint, or just a mad empty canvas meant for us to stan with our wonder-eyes? the tea is that these lit ideals get built partly by ghosting the extra details and partly by letting that savage imagination level up the form that real-life spill drops on you (phaedo, for real). plato serves these ideals like they're exclusive drops from another dimension; sometimes they come off as if they were posted pre-release, and other times they’re a straight collab with the artist in the moment. just like in science, creative art is both a remix (synthetical) and a breakdown (analytical) – one dude can have the whole aesthetic in his brain before he pops off, while another’s all about that simultaneous mind-and-hand flex.

3. yo, it’s mad obvious that plato’s division of knowledge is built on the ultimate smackdown between the sensory feels and the brainiac ideas – that pre-socratic vibe where everything’s split into permanent vs. temporary and universal vs. extra-small deets. but in his era, they had to add a next-level twist; numbers and figures started ghosting ideas like they were trending on their own. the world couldn’t just peep justice as a basic cube anymore, and was slowly learning that the abstract drip of your senses is diff from the abstract sauce in your mind. between the eleatic essence that’s 100% real and the shady silhouettes of phenomena, the pythagorean number flex slid right in, acting as that dope connector – as aristo once dropped in his mic-drop moment. so plato was like, “bet, let’s toss in a third term,” which wasn’t even on his original cheat sheet. he noticed that math was the ultimate edu hack, the perfect pre-game for higher studies. that personal math hookup even hinted at a bigger, objective glow-up; although, real talk, the jump between the two is hella imaginary (metaphorically speaking). because metaphysical and moral philosophy don’t really squad up with math – numbers and figures are just time and space’s abstract mini-me’s, not pure, unfiltered intellectual flexes. strip away the metaphor, and a straight line or a square don’t have much to do with right and justice any more than a wonky line is vibing with vice. this mix-up of symbolic association got taken way too literal, and that’s how the last three slices of the platonic pie got served up.

it gets even trickier when you try to peep how he landed on that first term in his series – it’s a lone wolf that never reappears anywhere else and doesn’t vibe with any other part of his system. and honestly, the link between shadows and real objects isn’t the same as the link between numbers and ideas. probably plato was too hyped on analogies (timaeus vibes, yo) and ended up with four terms instead of three, even though the stuff in both low-tier divisions is equally a sensory flex. he’s also setting the stage, in his extra cryptic way, for the shadow show at the start of book seven and the mimicry of a mimic in book ten. picture the line as a journey from that one singular vibe to the infinite – split into two uneven parts and then chopped into two more; each lower zone is basically the glow-up of the one before. among the four mental squads, the level of faith in the lower tier lands mid-game (for those reppin’ the greek word for faith or belief, as in timaeus), balancing the blurry vibe of shadow-perception (greek) with the next-level clarity of understanding (greek) and that raw reason (greek).

the diff between understanding and straight-up mind or reason (in greek) is like the diff between snagging clout through bits and pieces and vibing with the entire squad picture. true knowledge is the whole package – chill, consistent, and universal; those are the ultimate tests for what’s real. the mind is supposed to flex in sync with that self-evident truth. but then, there’s that half-cooked, forever-on-the-move knowledge that just can’t settle down because it’s forever stuck with its mini, sub-ideas. these mini ideas get tagged as both images and hypotheses – images ‘cause they’re decked out in sensory drip, and hypotheses ‘cause they’re just guesses until they squad up with the idea of good.

the overall tea from the line, “noble, then, is the bond which links together sight… and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible…”—when we flip it into modern philosophy lingo—spills out like this: there’s one truth, 100% self-existent, that our human brains can level up to by climbing a ladder dropped straight from on high. this unity is like the sun in the heavens – the ultimate glow that lets you flex with everything, the power that creates and holds it down. it’s the idea of good. and the steps on that ladder to the highest, most universal flex are the math sciences, which even have their own universal drip. when you link them up with the idea of good, they stop being just hypotheses or snapshots and instead become core parts of a higher truth that’s both their kickstart and their final win.

we can’t drop any extra receipts on this legendary passage, but we can peep several basic vibes that both we and plato share: (1) the squad goal and unity of the sciences – back in plato’s day, science wasn’t split into cliques yet; (2) the existence of a divine power or life force – an idea, cause, or reason – which wasn’t hyped up as a person back then even in the timaeus and other drop-it-like-it-is texts; (3) the recognition that the math sciences (and to an extent, every solo science) are kinda hypothetical and conditional when they’re left to roll alone; (4) the solid belief in a truth that’s invisible, and a law (though not a straight-up nature law) that seeps through the brainy realm way more than the visible one.

socrates’ method is hella chill and low-key hesitant, waiting on a full drop of the idea of good and the real scoop on dialectic in book seven. glaucon’s half-baked smarts and socrates’ mad laid-back vibe about kicking things off show just how tough the subject is. there’s bomb drops about theages’ bridle and socrates’ internal oracle (or demonic sign) – which, as always in plato’s playbook, is just there to shut things down; not to mention the fact that any leftover good in our messed-up world is all god’s work; a nod to a future state of existence that glaucon hasn’t even clocked in book ten, where socrates and his crew would drop more truth bombs; plus, surprises in the answers; socrates’ whimsical irony as he plays it like he can only describe the philosopher’s odd flex in metaphor; the original diss that sophists are just hype reps, not trendsetting leaders; the image of the philosopher posted on the sidelines in a sleet shower under a wall; the whole “great beast” vibe trailed by mad props for everyday peeps who wouldn’t ghost the philosopher if they actually knew him; the “right noble thought” that top-tier truths demand the sickest precision; socrates’ hesitance to circle back to his much-worn theme of the idea of good; glaucon’s laughably serious effort; and that extra quirky comparison of philosophy to a discarded maiden marrying beneath her status—these are some of the dopest characteristics found in book six.

yet, gotta drop some extra tea on that old-school convo that always popped off in the socratic circle—a convo that we, like glaucon and adeimantus, wanna get a clearer vibe on. like them, we’re all like, “nah, that’s sus” when peeps claim that the idea of good only drops for math nerds, and we’re convinced that neither they nor we could ever ride that lane to any solid win. we’ve learned that numbers don’t just flip into quality diff’s, and that math is never gonna level up on its own to our high-key mental league, even though it sometimes throws out symbols and vibes that train our minds to abstract and focus. the old illusion that was totally natural to an ancient philosopher is now straight-up overrated for us. but if the whole journey to snag the idea of good is just a wild imaginary trip, then can the idea itself be just another abstract meme? first off, across all eras—especially in those OG philosophy days—words like being, essence, unity, good have been dropping mad influence on people’s minds. the less they pack in content, the harder they hit – inversely proportional, for real. they became the epic forms under which all things were vibed with. there was some deep need in every soul that these words filled; they weren’t just ideas, they were like straight-up gods, and later generations started plugging the ancient deities’ powers into this fresh myth flex.

the idea of good, fam, is one of those sacred meme words or thought forms that slowly replaced old myth junk. it meant unity, where all of time and every bit of existence got mashed into one epic vibe. it was the truth behind everything, the bright light in which everything popped off, clear for both human and divine peepers. it was the creator flex, the power-up that brought all things into play. it was the universal reason minus any human personality – the life and light of the world, where all knowledge and power were wrapped up. the route to it was through math, and math was totally riding on that wave. asking whether god made it or was made by it is like asking if god can be thought of without that extra goodness, or goodness without god – no cap. the god from the timaeus isn’t beefing with the idea of good; they’re just two sides of the same coin, breaking it down as personal vs. impersonal or masculine vs. neuter – one drops that myth flex while the other straight-up channels philosophy.

this, or something on those lines, is the core vibe of the idea of good as plato peeped it. ideas about number, order, harmony, and growth all slide into it too. the recap right here might even go deeper than plato’s own words – maybe we’ve leveled up enough to understand what he was chasing better than he did himself. we’re starting to see what he peeped from afar, even if it was kinda hazy. but if someone told him that this, or a next-level version of the same thing, was the ultimate truth he was aiming for and the need he was trying to fill, he’d probably be like, “yo, my own brain had way more receipts than i even knew!” since his words were mad few and his style low-key, our own style as translators has to be equally chill. we can’t get any closer by over-defining him, because that’d risk losing the straight-up spirit of ancient philosophy when we flip it into modern lingo. it’s wild that although plato talks about the idea of good as the first principle of truth and being, it only shows up in his writings in this one epic passage. his disciples didn’t even vibe with it much later on—it was probably just too out there for them. even aristotle’s random drop about it in his bits doesn’t really link back to this or any other part of plato’s mega plan.

book vii. so now, imma drop a sick flex on how our inner vibes get lit or totally unlit: picture this, fam – humans are chillin’ in an underground den that’s lowkey open to the light; they've been stuck there since they were littles, with their necks and legs chained, so they can only peep the inner crib. way off, there’s a fire, and between that fire and the prisoners is a raised path with a low wall running along it, kinda like the screen where puppet players flex their shows. behind that wall, moving figures pop up, holding all kinds of art – images of dudes, animals, wood, stone – and some of the passing peeps are chatting while others are stone silent. one cat goes, “yo, this parable’s wild, and these captives are straight-up weird.” i clapped back, “nah, that’s us, fam; they only peep the shadows that the fire throws on the den’s wall. they even name these shadow vibes, and if you toss in an echo bouncing back from the wall, it sounds like the voices are coming straight from the shadows.”

now, imagine if you spun these peeps around and forced them to stare—with mad pain and sad feels—at the actual images. would they even think those are the real deal? their eyes would be straight-up blinded by the overload, and they’d probably yeet themselves away from the glare to somewhere they can peep without blinking. and yo, imagine they get hauled up a steep, gnarly climb right into the sun’s own chill zone—wouldn’t they be blinded by the extra brightness? it’d take them a hot minute to even get used to seeing; at first, they’d only catch mad shadows and random water reflections, then they’d slowly re-up their game to recognize the moon and stars, and finally they’d peep the sun chillin’ in its rightful space. in the end, they’d be like, “this is the one who dishes out the seasons and the year, the ultimate author of all our vibes.” just think about how they’d be vibing with that epic jump from darkness to major light, and how the bling of the old den would look hella basic in comparison.

but now, flip the script: picture these same peeps bouncing back to their old underground crib. in that familiar den, they wouldn’t see as clear as the homies, and they wouldn’t be able to flex in measuring the shadows on the wall. there’d be straight-up memes roasting the dude who tried to visit the sun and lost his peepers, and if anyone even tried to free or enlighten one of their own, they’d totally get clapped—if they could even catch him. here’s the rundown: the cave is basically the world of basic sight, the fire is the sun, and that uphill grind is the route to true knowledge. in the realm of knowledge, the idea of good shows up super rarely and on the DL, but when it does, it’s treated as the ultimate source of good and right—the parent vibe of the lord of light in our world and the OG of truth and understanding in the higher realm. anyone who hits that epic, beatific vision is always on the up; they ain’t down for petty political hangouts or lame courts, because their eyes are too pure to peep those shadow plays—they just can’t connect with folks who never learned that the shadow is only a sidekick to the real substance.

plus, check it: blindness comes in two modes. one’s from jumping out of darkness into a glare, and the other’s from sliding out of light into darkness. a real one will know the diff and won’t roast both equally; the blackout from too much brightness is actually a blessed vibe, while the other gets mad sympathy. and if he even laughs at that confused soul trying to peep the sun, he’s got more ammo for that laugh than the cave-dwellers get for roasting those who drop down from above.

here’s another nugget from our parable: some folks think schooling is like handing fresh eyes to the blind, but nah—those peepers were always in there. the soul just needs a 180 to face the light. that flip is conversion, fam; other vibes are like workout gains that come from practice, but real smarts are eternal, flipping to good or evil based on the direction they’re steered. ever notice how a slick hustler’s mind pops out more clarity the more he stares at his goals—even if that clarity makes him a bit savage? now, if you snip away all those heavy chains of pleasure and earthly desire dragging someone down, his mind will flip right around, letting him peep the truth as clearly as he already knows his own low-key aims.

and yo, haven’t we already agreed that our rulers can’t be so uneducated that they’ve got zero life rules, nor can they be so high-key overeducated that they refuse to leave their chill heaven of ideas for the real-world hustle? we gotta pick the peeps most likely to ascend to the epic light and deep knowledge of good; but we can’t let them just stay floating in that light—they gotta come down and share the grind and the glory with the squad in the den. “will they not think this a major hardship?” remember, our whole goal in crafting the state was never to let citizens do whatever vibes they want, but to have everyone serve the state for the common good. so we gotta be like, “hey, our philosophy fam, we ain’t doing you wrong; in other states, philosophy just goes wild like a rogue plant that owes nada to the gardener, but you’ve been trained by us to be the heads and kings of our hive, so we gotta insist you dip back into the den.” each one of you, take your turn, learn to flex your vision in the dark, and with a lil practice, you’ll out-see those stuck arguing over shadow drama—while their knowledge is just a hazy dream, yours is a waking, lit reality. maybe the saintly philosopher who’s best suited might be the least hyped to rule, but duty’s calling, and he can’t chill in that idea heaven forever. and that, fam, is the state’s ultimate save. ‘cause those who rule shouldn’t be the ones chasing clout for the sake of it; if you can hook our citizens up with a better vibe than typical rulers, there’s a shot that those rich in both goods and wisdom can take the reigns. and honestly, the only life that’s a serious upgrade over political hustle is the philosopher’s life—a life that’s also the ultimate pre-game for running a state.

then now here's the tea: how we gonna level up our rulers and glow-up from darkness to straight-up lit vibes? it's all thanks to philosophy, fam; not just flipping an oyster shell but totally converting a soul from that midnight drip to full-on daylight flex, from basic becoming to next-level being.

so what kind of training yeets the soul upward? our old-school edu was split into two branches: gym vibes for the bod and that sister art, music, which drips natural harmony into your brain and lit literature—yet neither of these dropped the promise of the epic upgrade we need.

what's left for us is that universal, OG science that all other arts and smarts ride or die with—i'm talking numbers and crunchin' digits. “deadass.” even the art of war gets roasted by it? “obs, bet.” it's kinda wild how palamedes in that ancient tragedy strolls in, bragging that he invented numbers, counted the ranks, and yeeted them into shape. 'cause if agamemnon couldn’t even count his own feet (and without digits how would he keep track?), dude was a weird sorta general. no soldier should roll if he can’t handle basic arithmetics—like, he wouldn’t even be called a real human, fr.

but yo, i'm not dishing on arithmetic’s practical hustle—i'm saying numbers are like the hype conductor for thought and being. let me break it down: the stuff you can peep with your eyes comes in two flavors; one squad hyping up your mind, and the other where your brain just chills and agrees.

the things that spark your brain are those that drop contrasts and squad vibes. like, imagine i hold up three digits—your index, middle, and pinky. your eyeballs catch the trio, but without numbers, your brain can’t really tell them apart on the deets.

or peep this: if you stack two objects—one hella big and one kinda small—the ideas of “big” and “small” aren’t served straight by your senses but whipped up by your mind. when you spot their contrast, your mental engine revs up to decide if you’re seeing one vibe or a full squad. numbers then swoop in, saying “nah fam, it’s two distinct ones,” so you can tell ‘em apart.

meanwhile, your eyes see the big and little in a jumbled chaos, and only when you clear the clutter does the real talk about their true nature pop off; thus we slide from the crummy visible to the epic intelligible. that’s what i meant about hyping the intellect—i was all about those mind-twisting contradictions that pop off in our perception.

like, the idea of oneness—say, one lonely finger—won’t even hit your brain unless you’ve got the vibe of many. but when that one also stands as “not one,” the twist sparks deep reflection; any random object out there can hit you with that kind of paradox.

all numbers bring a major glow-up too; they lift your mind out of the messy churn of everyday chaos into the contemplation of being, even if they borrow some soldier and shop vibes along the way. we don’t need the retail flex, but since our guardian squad is meant to be both warriors and wise bros, we can keep the military application on deck.

and for our higher purpose, no science can flex harder—yet it’s gotta be chased in true philosopher spirit, not like some bargain-bin shopkeeper hustle. it's all about that abstract truth, not just the visible hype; ‘cause numbers are pure ideas—the real math wizard will throw serious shade if you try dividing his “one.” he’s all, “you ain’t dividing, you’re just multiplying.” his “one” stays solid, unchanging, and that’s the whole point showing that math is a total brain upgrade.

plus, arithmetic is the ultimate edge-tool for sharpening the wits; no other subject lays down such hardcore tests of general skill or boosts a clueless npc into a straight-up genius.

now, for our second edu flex, let’s drop geometry into the mix. “i can totally vibe with that,” said glaucon, “a general’s game would double up with mad geometry skills.” it’s a minor flex, ‘cause geometry isn’t just about shapes—it’s the assist that helps you peep the idea of ultimate good and compels your mind to roll with true being, not just the messy generation of stuff.

but real talk: the way geometry is handled nowadays, as any math homie can tell you, is kinda whack and laughable; they make it all about looking down at the arts rather than peeping up at eternal existence. the geometer keeps chatting about squaring, subtending, apposing—as if he’s all about action—whereas the real prize is pure knowledge. geometry should lift the soul and craft that true philosophy mind; it should pull up what’s fallen and even help with war tactics and boosting overall mental gains.

so, how about we add astronomy as our third edu branch? “hell yeah,” said glaucon; “knowing the heavens is clutch for farming, navigation, and battle strategies.” i’m diggin’ your style of dropping practical tea to make connections with the world. but here's the catch: proving that edu isn’t just a data dump but a straight-up soul cleanse—purifying the inner eye way better than the physical one—is a major flex in uncovering truth.

now, are we appealing to the general squad or just to the philosopher elite? or you all about that self-love only? “every man is his own bestie,” they say. alright, take a chill step back ‘cause we’re off script—now we gotta insert the third dimension of solids after our flat planes, then slide into solids in motion.

but hey, solid geometry isn’t trending and lacks state love, nor does it get its full credit; it’s a hardcore challenge, and its fanboys can be extra conceited and impatient. still, the pursuit’s charm wins over peeps, and if the state threw some coin our way, we might score epic progress.

“deadass,” said glaucon, “so you’re saying we kick off with plane geometry, then move to solid geometry, and finally hit up astronomy—the science of moving solids?” yup, i said; my rush just jacked up our order, no cap.

“cool, now let’s jump into astronomy, and i’m down to drop this heavy talk in your high-key style. everyone can see that peeping the heavens gives a serious soul lift.” but yo, i'm an exception here; the way astronomy’s done these days seems to drag the soul down instead of lifting it. star-gazing nowadays is basically just checking out your ceiling—no upgrade there; whether you’re chilling on land or water, you can look up or down, but that ain’t science, bro.

the true vision of knowledge i’m throwing down isn’t seen with your basic eyeballs—it’s a brain thing. the magnificence of the heavens is just like a low-res remix, a copy that totally misses the divine original, and it teaches zilch about absolute harmonies or smooth, natural moves. their beauty’s like a dope sketch by daedalus or any great artist: cool for a pic, but no math whiz would mine real concepts of equality or deep numerical vibes from that art.

so how absurd is it to look for real truths in the star-map, where the messy imperfections of matter crash every party, wrecking the symmetry of day and night, months and years, sun and stars on their run? only by tackling real problems can we put astronomy on a legit scientific grind. let the heavens be while your intellect does the real heavy lifting.

still, math does flex in other ways—like the pythagoreans say, and i’m here for it. there’s that sister science of harmonic motion, tuned for the ear just as astronomy is for the eye, and maybe even more killer applications out there. let’s chat with the pythagoreans about that, but remember our ultimate aim is way higher: linking these subjects to the idea of good. the same bogus error crashing astronomy also messes up harmonics; musicians end up swapping minds for ears.

“yep,” said glaucon, “i peep them putting their ears right next to their homies’ faces—one dude saying, ‘that’s a new note,’ while another’s like, ‘nah, same vibe.’” yup, i said; but you’re talking about the empirics who keep twisting lyre strings and raging about string temper tantrums—i’m talking about the pythagorean harmonists, who are similarly off-track.

they only scope out the numbers behind the dope consonant sounds we hear, never leveling up to the true numerical harmony that’s totally unheard and only found in wild problems—they don’t even have a clue. “that last one must be lit af,” he said. i replied, “yeah, but it’s only clutch if you chase it for the ultimate good.”

all these subjects are just the prelude—the chill opening act—that pays off if you see how they naturally vibe together. “i gotta say, socrates,” said glaucon, “but this kind of study is gonna be a never-ending grind.” what are you even studying—the prelude or what? ‘cause all this is just the kick-off, and you don’t really think a mere math bro can double as a dialectician, right? “no doubt, i’ve never seen a mathematician who could actually debate.” and yet, glaucon, isn’t true reasoning that epic dialectic anthem—the music of the intellectual world—that we compared to the struggle of sight, when we peeped wall shadows before finally unlocking the real images behind them?

even so, when the dialectic flex pulls away from raw sense, your pure intellect eventually vibes up to the idea of good, and only chills at the very end of the intellectual game. that is the royal road from the cave to the light—the moment your eyes blink at the sun and then switch to peep the real shadows, not just cheap imitations. this steady glow-up, powered by math and deep thought, is how the soul graduates to peep the highest ideal of being.

“bet, i vibe with that. but now, ditching the prelude, let’s hit the jam: what’s the true nature of dialectic, and what’s the route to get there?” yo, glaucon, you can’t ride with me on this level. there’s no spilling absolute truth to someone who hasn’t been schooled in the earlier edus.

but i'm deadass sure there’s a science of absolute truth, reached in a way mad different from what we’re doing now. all the other arts and sciences just cater to human needs and opinions; mathematical sciences are like the dream or hypothesis of real being that never even breaks down its own vibes.

only dialectic can level up to that principle that’s way above all hypotheses, gently guiding the soul’s inner eye outta the messy gutter of ignorance and into the upper light—all with the help of the sciences we just dished out. these subjects, while often called by that name, actually deserve a whole new label: one that’s clearer than opinion but not as hardcore as science—in our earlier breakdown, that was “understanding.”

so here’s the ratio: we roll with four labels—two for intellect and two for opinion—reason (or mind), understanding, faith, and shadow perception; setting up that gangster proportion: being:becoming :: intellect:opinion and science:belief :: understanding:shadow perception.

dialectic, then, is that science which breaks down and explains the true essence of every vibe, singles out the good, and is always ready to throw hands with any hater trying to mess with the cause of good. for anyone not riding the dialectic wave, life is just a dopey daydream—and plenty of dudes are ghosted before they even wake up to the real deal.

and seriously, you wouldn’t want your future rulers to be brain-dead posts, right? “no cap, certainly not.” so you gotta school them in dialectic, which trains ‘em to both ask and drop killer answers—it’s the cornerstone of all the sciences.

i bet you haven’t forgotten how we pick our future bosses; the selection process gets an upgrade: as before, they gotta be ride-or-die, valiant, fine-lookin’, and rocking noble vibes, but now they also need that natural talent that edu will glow up; they need to be quick learners, able to hustle mentally, super retentive, solid, and diligent, mixing brain gains with moral street cred—no lame, one-sided types who grind only in the gym while their brain stays in sleep mode, or vice versa; not a busted soul that rages on fake vibes yet keeps wallowing in ignorance; not some weakling either, but someone sound in every way and prepped for the ultimate mental gym struggle.

even justice herself would be like, “yass, these peeps are on point”—they’ll be the true saviors of our state; any other type would just make philosophy look even more ridiculous than it already does. forgive my hype—I’m getting hella excited—but when i see justice trampled, i seriously lose it on those who dis her. “i didn’t even notice you were extra hyped,” someone might say. but i legit feel it deep, no cap.

and yo, let’s not forget another key point in picking our squad—they gotta be young, not old. solon was off-base saying an old dude can always learn; youth is the prime time to study, ‘cause the mind is free and dainty, and unlike the bod, it shouldn’t be forced to work against its vibe.

learning should start as straight-up play, where your natural bend shines through. like training puppy soldiers for battle, the young ones should only get a taste of the rough-and-tumble at first; but after the essential body's gymnastics—splitting life into sleep and physical reps over a couple of years—the soul’s edu gets real serious.

at twenty, you gotta pick out the most promising homies to kick off a new edu era. the bits of knowledge they’ve pieced together so far come together and align with true being; ‘cause that power to mix them up is the ultimate test of their speculative and dialectical game.

then, at thirty, you do another cut—only keep those who can bounce outta the chaotic world of senses into the abstract realm of ideas. but heads up: based on what we’ve seen, diving too deep into dialectic at this point might spawn a heap of drama.

peep this cautionary tale: imagine a kid raised in insane luxury, surrounded by bootlickers, who then finds out he’s a total fake son. he used to be all about respecting his so-called parents and ghosting the fakers, but now he flips the script. that’s exactly how a dude’s core principles fall apart. he’s been schooled at home on certain vibes that ruled his world, until haters start throwing shade—some annoying questioner rolls in asking, “what’s just and good?” or even claiming that virtue is lowkey vice and vice is virtue, and suddenly his mind’s all over the place, and he stops loving, honoring, and following those deep-rooted vibes he once lived by.

he gets seduced by hedonistic pleasures and turns into a lawless rogue. such speculators are hella sad, and so that our thirty-year-old squad don’t end up in that pity party, we gotta take extreme care that no young pup dives into philosophy too early.

a young dude is like a puppy that only plays with arguments—flipping in and out of opinions every day until nothing feels real, dragging both himself and philosophy into a total lose-lose. but a thirty-year-old? that cat debates like a boss rather than just flip-flopping, adding mad respect to philosophy with his chill, sober flow.

so how much time do we allocate for this second gym session of the soul? maybe twice the time of the body’s gym—like five or six years starting at thirty, then let the student spend another fifteen years chilling in the den, commanding armies, and collecting life XP. at fifty, have him bounce back to the ultimate endgame, lifting his eyes to that pure idea of good and remixing his life to that beat; and if needed, he can captain the state and school the next-gen bosses. when his time comes, he’ll peace out to the islands of the blest, honored with sacrifices and worship approved by the pythian oracle.

“yo, socrates, you’re like a living statue—you’ve crafted the perfect meme of our future governors.” yes, and our lady governors too, ‘cause the women are 100 on sharing all things with the men. you gotta admit our state isn’t just a wild dream—it can totally pop off when philosopher-kings rise, one or more, lowkey trashing earthly vanities and serving straight-up justice vibes.

“so how do they even kick off the work?” their first move is to yeet out everyone over ten years old into the country and roll with the remaining crew...

at the start of book six, plato drops hints about how the philosopher vibes with the world through a sick allegory—following his edu roadmap from the concrete to the abstract. then, at the start of book seven, he paints the iconic cave scene: a cave with an opening toward a fire and a secret path upward to pure light. there, he breaks down the levels of knowledge like a dope pic—showing the result of a mad grind of thought from before, while also tossing peeks at the dialectic journey, repped by the ride from darkness to light. the shadows, the images, the reflections of the sun and stars in water, and then the stars and sun themselves all line up—the first set representing the realm of wild fancy and poetry; the second, the raw world of senses; the third, those abstract universals that math pegs as the blueprint; and the fourth, these same abstractions when they unify into one epic idea, gaining new meaning and power. the true dialectic ride starts with peeping the actual stars—not just their weak imitations—and ends when you recognize the sun, or idea of good, as the ultimate source not just of light but of warmth and growth.

now, matching the divisions of knowledge, the edu stages come in three flexes: first, there’s the early schooling of kids and teens with poetic fancies and the state’s laws and customs; then comes training the bod to be a warrior-athlete and a solid servant of the mind; and lastly, after a chill gap, the later-life edu kicks off with math and slides into philosophy in full.

there seem to be two major vibes in plato’s philosophy – first, to peep pure abstractions; and second, to hook them up together. according to plato, real education is all about leveling up from just “becoming” to full-on being, and getting that 360° tour of all existence. he’s all about boosting the human mind’s ability to spot the universal drip in every single thing, until all the petty sensory deets ghost and only the universal glow remains. then he tries to remix these universals he pulled out from raw sense, not realizing that their hookup is based solely on our common language flex. like, he totally misses that abstractions – as hegel would spill – are “mere abstractions”: they’re clutch for stacking up facts, but when you chase them alone or with some imagined idea of “good,” they add zero extra knowledge juice.

but yo, even when you flex that abstraction power separate from the facts, it still makes your brain bigger and plays a huge part in leveling up humanity. plato was all about that, and he peeped that his mental gains could be turbocharged by diving into numbers and relationships. anything that spits out opposition or perfect ratios is just screaming “reflect on me!” a straight-up sensory vibe won’t spark any big brain moves – but when things around you start demanding a diff between them, that’s when philosophy starts its yeet. arithmetic was the OG that flexed these distinctions first; then rolled in were the other sciences – basic geometry, solid geometry, and even solids in motion (one branch of which was astronomy, aka the harmony of the spheres) – capped off with its sister science, the harmony of sounds. plato even dropped hints that math ratios could flex in other areas, like modern chemistry and natural philosophy – the same sauce the pythagoreans and even aristotle used in ethics and politics (think his split between arithmetical and geometrical proportions in ethics, or numerical vs. proportional equality in politics).

modern math nerds would totally vibe with plato’s hype for pure math properties. they’d be like, “forget the heavens – let’s just study the raw beauty of numbers and shapes.” and they’d low-key roast applying these concepts to the arts. they’d note that plato had this next-level geometry vision where the figures themselves got yeeted, kind of pre-figuring the idea of solving geometry probs with a more general analysis flex. they’d also call out the retro state of solid geometry in plato’s day – which, no cap, didn’t get that state-sponsored boost – and they’d respect plato’s genius in dreaming up a science of solids in motion that mashed together earth and the heavens. and yo, they’d be shook by how plato, back when these sciences were barely a thing, insisted they had to be studied in relation to one another and tied back to the idea of good – that all-star principle of truth and being. but they’d also peep that in that era, plato slipped by thinking he could construct the heavens on autopilot with math problems and lock down harmony rules without tuning into the real sound vibes our ears catch. that misfire was natural back then, since the simple, clean drip of astronomy and harmonics clashed with the wild, messy state of sensory life – so missing a basic fact-check (like measuring distance, time, or vibrations) was kinda expected. even the OGs before newton dropped similar oopsies; so plato wasn’t that off-base – he might even’ve been low-key prophetic when you consider that today, most astro flex comes from abstract dynamics that have unlocked a ton of astronomical discoveries.

the metaphysical brainiac sees math as a sick tool for education – one that pumps up your focus, instills order, and builds the mind’s ability to decode the quantitative differences in physical phenomena with simple formulas. but while he’s hype on its edu value, he’s also like, “nah, these dudes don’t link up with our higher moral and mental vibes.” when plato tries to connect math to higher ideas, you can totally spot those ancient pythagorean vibes. he isn’t dissing ideal numbers per se; he’s talking about pure abstract numbers that he gives their own real-life cred – the kind that the “teachers of the art” (probably the pythagoreans) would clap for because they’re immune to any subdivision, with unity and every other number being treated as absolute. when numbers get snatched away from raw phenomena, their truth and unshakeable drip turn them into something almost sacred in the eyes of old-school philosophers. and it’s hard to nail down exactly how the vibes of order and fixity might’ve boosted people’s moral levels – like in the timaeus, where it’s suggested that peeps could learn to reroute their messy lives according to these principles. worth noting, the classic pythagorean ethical icons are still flexing as figures of speech among us today. and if you peep modern times, where the world feels ruled by some universal law, you might also catch a preview of that final modern philosophy drop in plato’s idea of good – the ultimate source and ruler of all things, even though it’s still just an abstraction (philebus style).

alright, so two bits here need extra deets. first up: the whole analysis of vision. the head-scratch here comes from the fact that ancient and modern minds got totally different rides on perception. for us, what we sense is inseparable from the brain’s own lit processing vibes – the feel for form, color, distance, all merge with the raw sensation. but for plato, the senses are like a heraclitean flow – not a crisp lineup of objects as they hit your retina, but more like a blurry, confused meme as seen by a half-awake baby’s peepers. the mind’s first move is to try and sort out that chaos, using pure reason to label and organize these fuzzy impressions. and boom – that sparks the question, “what’s big, what’s small?” and that’s how the split between the visible and the intelligible drops into play.

next up, the second head-scratcher is plato’s take on harmonics. he splits the harmony squad into three groups: first, the pythagoreans – the OG harmonizers he wanted to chat with (kinda like his earlier music sesh with damon) – who are total masters of the sonic art but completely miss the deeper link to the good; second, the basic empirics, which glaucon kinda confuses with the pythagoreans, and whom both he and socrates hilariously roast for just doing random ear experiments on sound intervals. both crews fall short in different ways when compared to plato’s ideal of harmony, which he insists must be studied in a totally abstract way – first through problem-solving, and then as a part of that universal knowledge tied to the idea of good.

the allegory here spills major tea with both political and philosophical drip. the cave (or den) is the narrow AF zone of politics and law (check out the theaetetus for a full rundown on philosopher vs. lawyer vibes), and the light of eternal ideas is meant to shake up the minds of those who bounce back to the lower world. in other words, their sky-high principles are way too extra for everyday grind; they’re peeping way back into history and cruising into the future when the real hustle is in the now. the ideal just doesn’t slide easily into actual life, and it often clashes with the real deets. and in the beginning, when these upper-brain homies try to come back down, they can’t hold their own against the den’s crew measuring shadows – they get mocked and even persecuted; but after a minute, they start seeing the lowworld with a clarity that outshines those who never left the cave. the diff between a politico who flips into a philosopher and a philosopher who hops into politics is shown by two types of messed-up vision: one is that of the captive who gets hit with sudden daylight after total darkness, and the other is the heavenly messenger who voluntarily drops into the den to help his squad. exactly how that dope light eventually guides the peeps in the lower world, or how the idea of good turns into the main rule of politics, remains a mystery in plato’s playbook – almost like the low-key breakdown of dialectic that glaucon was dying to hear more about. perhaps, plato would’ve said such tea could only be served to a disciple of the old-school sciences (symposium vibes).

plenty of examples of this part of the republic pop up in modern politics and everyday life. in our own scene, we’ve got two types of politicos whose vision goes totally off-kilter. first, there are the big-brain legends who, to borrow burke’s words, were “too much given to general maxims” – folks like j.s. mill or burke himself who were philosophers or theorists before sliding into politics, or who were so deep into history that they filtered today’s events through epic historical parallels like the english revolution of 1688, athenian democracy, or roman imperialism. or maybe, the long, looming shadow of some heavyweight institution darkened their vibe. the church of the future, the commonwealth of the future, even the society of the future got so plugged into their heads that they couldn’t peep today’s politics for what it truly was. they got totally lit on grand ideas like liberty, equality, maximal happiness for the most, or global brotherhood – and stopped thinking about how these killer ideas need limits or a remix to fit human life. they’re glowing, but their glow turned into a blinding luminous mist. honestly, we all know that one half-educated hypebeast who sees everything way off-scale and in the wrong ratios.

now, flip the script to peeps who only focus on what’s right in front of them – homies who’ve been grinding in one trade their whole lives, locked into their own clique. these dudes don’t have any universal vibe beyond their own hustle or class interests; their only rulebook is the squad’s opinion, and they get zero intel beyond what’s blowing up on their streets or in their club. imagine flipping these folks into the big leagues – turning tradesmen into generals or politicos, schoolmasters into deep philosophers – or suddenly, they catch an inner light revealing a higher idea of god and a whole spiritual world. would that sudden glow-up really flip their daily grind, or would their old-school biases and narrow views just cling on for dear life even after they start looking at the bigger picture? from real-life examples like these, we get what plato meant by vision going through two types of glitches.

and we can low-key draw a parallel between the young anthenian in the fifth century bc, all shook by fresh ideas, and a modern uni student hit with that “aufklärung” moment. we see that when young peeps start calling out outdated beliefs or dissecting the constitution of human nature, they tend to lose grip on any solid principles (ἅπαν τὸ βέβαιον αὐτῶν ἐξοίχεται). they’re like trees that get transplanted way too often – the ground they’re in is all loose and they’ve got no deep roots. they bounce from one trending flower to the next, just riding whatever random wind blows by, catching opinions like they’re viral diseases in the air. before you know it, they’re switching up beliefs left and right, totally abandoning the basic right-versus-wrong diff they were raised with. they think they’re on a truth hunt, but it’s just the “follow my leader” game. they fall head over heels at first glance for moral paradoxes, wild art theories, odd religious quirks – and get so deep in their new ideas that nothing else seems to matter. for them, solving a philosophical or theological beef beats out any real knowledge of literature, science, or even just living a chill life. like the youth in the philebus, they’re down to drop a new philosophy to anyone who’ll listen. these kids usually end up as max fans of some big-name professor or sophist – more copycat than actual deep-diver. they’re lucky if, later on, they can hold onto even a bit of that basic truth from early education that might end up being worth more than all the rest. that’s the snapshot plato paints – a savage vibe check on how youth get totally lost in transitions when old opinions ghost and the new ones haven’t even landed yet. he compares it to that wild twist of a pseudo-son who discovers his so-called parents aren’t even his real folks, and bam – his whole world of authority crumbles.

and then there’s the diff between the math geeks and the dialectic bosses. plato was crystal clear that the brain of a mathematician is on a whole other wavelength than that higher philosophical sense that spots and fuses first principles. his side-eye for word distinctions, his warning about accidental BS, and socrates’ legit apology for his super serious speech style are all classic platonic moves. think about that quirky idea that if palamedes invented numbers, agamemnon couldn’t even count his own feet; the whole art of making us believe our state isn’t just some dope daydream; and the epic seriousness with which the first step in state-building was taken – like sending every ten-year-old out to level up education within a generation – all serve as pure platonic memes. (peep the end of book three for the tea on that earthborn man lie passed down to generation two.)

book viii.
so, we’ve arrived at the ultimate verdict: in the perfect state, bae and kiddos are all about sharing – wives and children are communal; education and hustles for all genders, in both war and peace, are communal; kings must be philosopher-warriors; and state soldiers live together, sharing everything, rocking that communal life – they’re mad warrior athletes who get no coin but are fed by the squad. now, let’s bounce back to our earlier digression. “that’s a breeze,” he clapped back, “you were chatting about the state you built and its matching individual, both of which you called dope; and you said that for the lower-tier states, there are four types with matching individuals – each kinda weak in its own way, but all worth peeping to figure out who’s living their best life and who’s stuck in misery. then polemarchus and adeimantus butted in, sparking another debate – and here we are.” now, let’s rewind and re-ask your question: “i wanna know, what kinds of constitutions were you talking about?” besides the perfect state, there are only four lit ones in hellas: first, the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth; second, oligarchy – a state loaded with bad juju; third, democracy, which comes next; and fourth, tyranny, which is basically the viral death of all government. now, states aren’t built out of “oak and rock” – they’re made of flesh and blood; so if there are five state vibes, there gotta be five matching human natures. first up, there’s the ambitious nature, which vibes with the lacedaemonian state; second, the oligarchical nature; third, the democratical nature; and fourth, the tyrannical nature. this last one gets compared with the perfectly just vibe – which is the fifth – so we can peep who’s living happier and decide whether thrasymachus’ clapback or our own reasoning is the real flex. and just like we jumped from state to individual before, now starting with timocracy, let’s roll into the timocratical man, and then break down the other forms of government and the individuals that rock them.

so how did timocracy, that half-lit vibe, pop off from the perfect state? obviously, just like every government glow-up, it all went down ‘cause the ruler squad split up over petty beef. but where’d that drama even come from? yo, “sing, heavenly muses,” like homer flexin’, let ‘em drop wisdom on us little kiddos like they’re playin’ teachers with that fake serious face. and what’s the spicy tea? they’re gonna say that all human stuff is doomed to get dusty, and even the perfect state can’t dodge fate when “the wheel comes full circle,” whether that’s on a quick hype or a long-ass wait. like plants and animals, everybody’s got their fertile glow-up and off-season, which even the rulers—blended with a bit of sense—can’t peep, so kiddos start droppin’ off outside the season. see, while the divine squad is on a flawless cycle vibe, our human creation is messin’ with a number system that’s slowly drippin’ from perfection, rockin’ four phases and three breaks—growing, dying down, mixin’ it up, and splitting off—but still keepin’ it all in check. the base number, add a fourth (that’s a 3:4 flex), multiply that by five and cube it, and boom: you get two smooth harmonies—the first, a square number that’s literally a hundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong remix made of a hundred squares from a figure that’s rockin’ a side of five, subtractin’ one from each square (or two perfect squares overall), then addin’ a hundred cubes of three. this whole geometric math flex is basically the rulebook of creation. when peeps ghost that law, marriages turn hella sus; the weak offspring that drop in turn end up running the show, the state crumbles, education gets left in the dust, gym class replaces smooth tunes, and gold, silver, brass, and iron start mashin’ together into a chaotic block party—bam, division is born. that’s the muses’ savage clapback to our Q. and yo, a legit answer too—but what else they got to spill? they drop that the two cliques—the iron and brass crew versus the silver and gold squad—split the state in different directions: one crew goes hard on hustlin’ and cash stacking, while the other, rockin’ real riches and not sweatin’ money, straight up clashes with ’em. the showdown? it ends in a lame compromise where they decide to vibe with private property and even enslave the peeps who used to be their ride-or-die homies. no cap, though, they still keep that warrior drip, spendin’ most of their energy on brawls and power flex. that’s how timocracy slides right between aristocracy and oligarchy.

the fresh form of gov totally mimics the ideal vibe—rulers are obeyed hardcore and trade is looked down on, all while everyone shares communal chow and is all in on war trends and gym flex routines. but yo, corruption sneaked into philosophy, and that once chill, down-to-earth character is now only spotted in the military squad. soon enough, arts of war flex so hard they outshine arts of chill, and the ruler is no longer a deep thinker. like in oligarchy, an over-the-top love for mad profit pops up—“steal someone else’s bag and lock down your own,” is the motto. meanwhile, they stash their gold and silver in sketchy spots for their bae squad and whoever else, snatching their fun on the low like teens dodging papa law, and their edu isn’t sparked by the muses but forced down by a heavy-ass strong arm. the top vibe of this state? pure party spirit and next-level ambition.

so what kinda dude vibes with this state? adeimantus drops, “in love with the drama, he’s basically like our homie glaucon.” true in some ways, but not all. this dude’s all about self-assertion yet got a half-broken edu, still diggin’ literature even if he can’t spit slick speeches himself; he’s savage with his underlings but always lowkey obeys the boss moves, cravin’ power and honor that he thinks he can snag with epic battle moves—plus he’s into gym flex and huntin’ too. as he levels up, he turns extra greedy ‘cause he’s lost that deep philosophy vibe—the only real savior and guard of mankind. check his backstory: his pops was a solid dude livin’ in a totally whack state who dipped from politics just to catch some chill life. meanwhile, his mom got hella salty over losin’ her prime spot among the ladies, dissin’ her hubby’s selfishness and goin’ off on her son about how unmanly and lazy his dad is. then the OG family servant chimes in, tellin’ the kid, “when you grow up, you gotta be more of a man than your old man.” everyone around’s like, anyone who just sticks to their lane is a total noob, while the nosy types get mad props. so our young bro takes all that in, compares it to his dad’s lame moves, and even though he’s been hit by some bad memes, he lands in the middle and gets all ambitious for that honor drip.

now, peep this—let’s flip to another city and another dude. the next gov mode is oligarchy, where only the rich squad flexes power; and it’s mad obvious how that vibe catches on. the downfall kicks off when peeps start hoardin’ gold and silver; sketchy spending hacks get invented; one person’s hustle rubs off on another, and the whole crew catches the cash virus; riches start outweighin’ virtue; money-lovers bust honor-lovers, and tightwad politicos rise up; soon, political perks are locked down by law only for the rich, who don’t even blink at using violence to smash their goals.

so here’s the tea on origins—next, let’s roast the evils of oligarchy. like, would you let a rich dude with mad clout be your pilot just ‘cause he’s loaded, or ghost a bomb pilot ‘cause he’s broke? duh, same vibe applies to the state even harder. and things get even crazier: two tribes are clashing in one joint—the rich versus the broke; the rich are way too chicken to hand arms to the poor and are not even willin’ to drop coin on legit defenders. haven’t we already called out that state where the same peeps double as warriors and shopkeepers? the ultimate L is when a dude can flip his property and still get left out of the state; one squad is rollin’ in cash while the other is straight-up destitute. but peep this—the broke squad never had that leader spark even when they were loaded; they were always trash spendthrifts. they’re basically the drones in a hive—except real drones don’t even have a sting, and the two-legged ones we call drones – some are stingless while others pack crazy stings. in short, you got paupers and rogues, always hangin’ together; and in oligarchical towns where nearly everyone who isn’t ruling is broke, you’ll see a hella mix of both. all this mess? it goes down thanks to whack edu and crappy government.

just like the state, so is the man—his transformation kicks off with the timocracy rep. at first, he’s chillin’ in his old man’s vibe (maybe a legit statesman or even a general), until he sees his pops “fallen from his high estate,” totally wrecked by snitches, dying in jail, exiled, or getting yeeted by the executioner. that brutal lesson makes him extra cautious; he bails on politics, ditches his pride, and starts savin’ every penny. greed gets crowned as the top boss in his heart, struttin’ like the big king, while his rational and fiery sides sit on the sidelines—one busy crunchin’ numbers, the other lowkey worshipping wealth. honor flips to money love in a snap. our dude becomes that super stingy, workin’ his tail off, a slave to one dominating obsession—like, isn’t he the ultimate state flex? if he had any proper edu, he wouldn’t let the blind god of riches control his inner rave. uneducated as he is, he’s loaded with petty, shady desires that multiply in his soul. if he’s put in charge of an orphan and has the power to con, he soon proves his will is strong—and that his wild urges are only held back by fear, not real reason. so he ends up livin’ a split life where the decent vibes mostly win. but when he’s scrappin’ for clout and trophies, he freaks about losses that only earn him empty honor; in war, he only throws a tiny slice of his resources, usually keepin’ his coin safe while gettin’ wrecked in battle.

next up comes democracy and the democratic dude, comin’ straight outta oligarchy’s mess. oligarchy was runnin’ on crazy greed and pushed expensive habits so these ballers could profit off the extra wild youth. families end up losin’ their asset drip or even their citizen rights, but they still stick around in the city, burnin’ with hate against the new estate owners and ripe for a revolution. the usurer, struttin’ all low-key with his hunched walk, pretends not to see them; he just cruises by, leavin’ his sting—that is, his cash—stuck in some other victim; lots of dudes end up payin’ up a boss-level sum that multiplies into a family drama, gettin’ dragged into total drone mode. the only fix? either cap how hard a dude can flex his property or force him to lend only at his own risk. but the ruling squad ain’t about fixes—they only chase that money and couldn’t give two snaps about virtue, just like the poorest players. then, sometimes, the rulers and the ruled vibe together—at festivals, on trips, whether they’re juicin’ or battlin’. the tough-ass broke guy finds that when danger hits, he ain’t dissed; he sees the rich dude gaspin’ and, lowkey, tells his crew, “our people ain’t all that.” and like a fragile frame gettin’ wrecked by a simple tap, the city straight-up breaks and fights like it’s life or death. democracy then slides into power when the poor squad wins—snuffin’ some, exilin’ others, and divvyin’ up government shares equally among the rest.

life in this state is hella democratic—full-on freedom and real talk, where every dude does what he thinks is right and lives by his own rules. from that, all kinds of character mash-ups pop up; the state turns into a mega embroidered piece where every thread is a different human vibe, and a bunch of peeps (like even the ladies and kids) would rather roll with that wild variety than some basic, vanilla excellence. the state ain’t a single vibe but a massive bazaar where you can cop literally anything. the dopest part? you do you—go lead if you wanna, or just chill; go to war or make peace if you’re feelin’ it, without givin’ a damn about anyone else. even when you sentence dudes to death, they somehow keep on livin’; a proper gent might get exiled and still roam the streets like a low-key hero, unnoticed and uncared for. check how democracy stomps on all those fancy edu theories—she literally doesn’t care about trainin’ real statesmen! her only checklist is that you spit some sick patriotism. that’s democracy: a dope, lawless smorgasbord of government divvying up equality to both the equal and the not-so-equal.

now let’s peep the individual democrat, and just like the state, trace his backstory. he’s the kid of a stingy oligarch who schooled him to keep his extra pleasure cravings on lockdown. let’s break that down: necessary pleasures are the legit must-haves that are all good and essential, while unnecessary pleasures are just extra junk that does no real good and could be nixed early on. like, eatin’ and drinkin’ are essential and healthy up to a point; past that, they hurt both your bod and brain, so you best not go overboard. when you overdo it, they turn into what you’d call expensive pleasures—totally the opposite of the useful ones. and our so-called drone? he’s straight-up enslaved by these extra, unnecessary cravings, while the miserly oligarch only vibes with what’s truly needed.

here’s how the oligarch flips into a democrat: the kid, raised on that tight-budget vibe, gets a taste of the drone’s sweet honey when he hangs with wild, extra squad who introduce him to every new pleasure. just like in the state, in any individual there are two cliques: external temptations and inner passions, backed by reason and the influence of parents and friends who are still team oligarchy; and these two forces duke it out hardcore. sometimes the order squad wins, but then fresh cravings and chaos pop off, and the whole mob of wild feels takes over the acropolis—that is, the soul—which they find totally undefended ‘cause there’s no real talk or solid action guarding it. fake vibes and illusions climb in to take over; the prodigal kid bounces back to the land of the lotophagi (or drones) and just crashes there. and if any elder tries to drop a peace offer, the fake spirits slam the castle gates and shut ‘em out—boom, battle ensues and the fake crew wins; then, in a quick remix, they team up with these desires, boot modesty (calling it “folly”) and kick temperance outta the party. once the pad’s been swept and decked out, they rebrand the exiled vices with fresh names—insolence becomes “good breeding,” anarchy is dubbed “freedom,” waste gets called “magnificence,” and impudence turns into “courage.” that’s the wild process by which the youth shifts from necessary pleasures to the extra ones. before long, he splits his time evenly between them; and maybe, when he levels up and his wild passion fades a bit, he reclaims some of those booted vices and finds a weird balance, bouncing from one pleasure to another; and if reason tries to drop wisdom that some pleasures are chill and honorable while others are trash, he just shrugs and goes, “can’t really tell ‘em apart.” so he lives purely in the vibe of the moment—sometimes boozin’ and then flippin’ to sober mode; hittin’ the gym or straight-up chillin’; sometimes being a philosopher or a politician; or even a warrior or a business boss—he’s all over the place, living by “everything starts fast and nothing lasts.”

and then we hit the ultimate level—the finest and fairest of all men and states: tyranny and the tyrant. tyranny blows up from democracy just like democracy popped off from oligarchy. both are born from excess; one from overblown wealth, the other from too much freedom. as one democrat be like, “the greatest natural good in life is freedom.” but this one-track love for freedom, without givin’ a damn about anything else, is exactly what flips democracy into tyranny. the state craves that potent, strong wine of freedom, and if its rulers don’t pour a heavy jug, she straight-up punishes and disses ‘em; it’s all about equal squad vibes between the governors and the governed. anarchy becomes the law not just for the state but for every crib, even spillin’ over to the animals. father and son, citizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, oldies and newbies—they’re all on the same level; even parents and teachers get spooked by their kids’ drip, ‘cause the young ones’ wisdom can totally match the old, and the elders end up mimicking the young just to dodge bein’ seen as lame. slaves end up on the same wavelength as their masters and mistresses, and there’s zero diff between dudes and dudettes. nah, even the animals in a democratic state are free like you wouldn’t believe—the she-dogs are just as fly as their queens, and horses and donkeys strut with mad dignity, runnin’ their noses at anyone who dares step in their lane. i’ve seen it happen, trust. eventually, citizens get so extra they can’t stand the yoke of laws—written or unwritten—they straight-up refuse to let anyone call them master. that’s the flashy kickoff from which tyranny sprouts. “glorious, indeed; but what comes next?” the collapse of oligarchy spells doom for democracy too; ‘cause there’s a law of opposites—too much freedom slides into total slavery, and the bigger the freedom, the harder the slavery hits. remember, in oligarchy you had two squads—rogues and paupers—kinda like drones with and without stings. these two cliques are to the state what phlegm and bile are to the human bod, and the state doctor—a legislator—has gotta boot them out, just like a bee-master keeps drones out the hive. now in a democracy, there are drones too, but they’re hella more numerous and dangerous than in oligarchy; there they’re lazy and untrained, but here they’re buzzing with energy and hustle—the sharper ones speak up and act, while the rest buzz around the stage, drownin’ out any opposing vibes. plus, there’s another crew of respectable, thriving peeps who end up gettin’ squeezed when the drones need to snatch their loot; and then there’s a third squad, the laborers and artisans, who make up the bulk of the people. when the people squad meets, they’re pretty much omnipotent—but they won’t squad up unless there’s a sweet lure, like a bit of honey; and the rich are forced to supply that honey, with demagogues hoardin’ most of it for themselves and only droppin’ a nibble for the mob. their victims try to fight back, but the drone stings drive ‘em mad, forcing them into full-on oligarch mode in self-defense. then come the snitch reports and treason convos. the people end up pumpin’ up some protector from among themselves, and from that seed the tyranny tree sprouts. the shift is laid out in that old fable about the temple of zeus lycaeus—how anyone who snacks on human flesh mixed with other victims’ meat eventually turns into a wolf. same deal: the protector who feasts on human blood, who slays some and banishes others (law or no law), and even hints at wiping out debts and dividin’ lands, is bound to either get clapped or morph into a wolf—that is, a tyrant. maybe he’s booted for a while, but he always bounces back from exile; and if his haters can’t nail him the legit way, they start schemin’ his assassination. then the people’s boyo drops his classic request for a bodyguard, which they hook him up with, thinkin’ only ‘bout his danger and not theirs. now let the rich dude build himself wings, ‘cause if he doesn’t dip at that moment, he’ll never run again. and the great protector, having squashed all his rivals, stands tall in the state chariot like a full-blown tyrant. now let’s peep what his happiness vibe is all about.

in the early days of his tyranny, our dude was grinning at everyone like he was the ultimate hypebeast; he wasn’t that boss-level dominus—nah, he only rolled up to shut down mad debt and break the land monopoly. after ghosting all the foreign haters, he made himself super necessary to the state by flexing on every war like it was a non-stop clout chase. this savage play let him hit the poor with heavy tax leveling so they kept grinding, and if any bold AF spirit tried to dip out, he’d yeet ‘em straight over to the enemy squad. then, lol, unpopularity hit hard—some of his old day ones had the guts to throw him shade. consequence? he had to do a major state purge, but unlike a chill doctor who just clears out the bad vibes, he had to off every lit, smart, and loaded homie; cuz he wasn’t down with choosing between death or a lifetime of shame and dishonor. and the more hate he racked up, the more ride-or-die guards he needed—but how was he gonna score those? “they’ll flock in like paid-up birds.” wouldn’t it be way easier to just cop ’em on the spot? he’d just snatch up the slaves from their owners and turn ‘em into his personal bodyguard crew—his true day ones who stan his every move. and lowkey, those tragic poets? they were out here hyping up the tyrant, saying he’s like genius by mere association with other genius peeps. but yo, if all they’re doing is flexing tyranny, that’s more than enough reason for us to yeet them from our state.

talking about our tyrant again—how’s he gonna bankroll that ultra-rare army? first, by straight-up copping temple treasures (which lets him ease up those brutal taxes); then he snatches up all his dad’s drip and splurges it on his crew, no cap, whether dude or dudette. now, his pops is the demus, and if the demus gets heated and goes, “yo, big hulking son, you ain’t here to be a burden on your folks—bounce with your wild crew!” then the old head realizes he’s been nurturing a legit monster, and the son he wants to yeet is just too savage for him. “you serious that he’s gonna smack his father?” oh fr, he will—after disarming him, of course. “then he’s basically a parricide and a cruel, unnatural son.” meanwhile, the people have straight-up jumped from fear of being enslaved to living in full-on servitude, like going from smoke to straight-up fire. so liberty, when it falls out of all order and logic, dives headfirst into the worst form of enslavement ever.

in the previous books, plato already dropped the deets on that ideal state vibe; now he’s back to spill on all those twisted, declining forms he barely touched on at the end of book iv. he goes off on a series of dope parallels between individuals and states, tracing how each one’s drip comes from what came before. he kicks things off by asking exactly where he veered off track, and soon he’s recapping the main tea from the first three books—which even threw a sick parallel between the philosopher and the state.

for the first decline, our dude doesn’t even drop clear tea; he wasn’t feeling admitting that his ideal state fell apart ‘cause real-life communism was too sus or simply because the ruling squad and the regulars were on constant beef. instead, he shrouds the origin of the downfall in mystery, blaming it on our cluelessness about the law of population. and this law? it’s all about that famous geometric figure or number vibe. like a bunch of old-school OGs, he had zero notion about humans leveling up slowly or schooling the human race. his ideal wasn’t something to be unlocked over generations—it was supposed to drop fully armored straight from the legis-lord’s brain. once good laws were in play, his only thought was how fast they’d get finessed by shady corruption or twisted beyond their original spirit. clearly, he never peeped the full weight of his own line, “in the brief space of human life, nothing great can be accomplished,” or later in the laws, “infinite time is the maker of cities.” his lineup of constitutions was more like an epic thought track than a time-lapse series—basically his first attempt at a full-on philosophy of history.

next up in the decline squad is timocracy—government by soldiers and honor-chasers, basically that spartan flex. it’s a force-driven rule where the vibes aren’t inspired by the muses but are imposed by strict law, and all those elegant organization details have ghosted. our philosopher had already dipped from loving truth, so now the simple, no-cap soldier takes the wheel. the typical timocratic homie comes off as low-key undereducated—like a spartan who still digs literature—but even though he acts as a harsh master to his crew, he doesn’t actually stand above them naturally. his whole persona is a savage reaction to his old man dropping out of the messy politics of a troubled city, while his mom—totally unimpressed with her own spot—keeps pushing him towards chasing political clout. this vibe might come straight from that family drama, and even livy dished that the licinian laws popped off from some wild feminine jealousy. but yo, there’s clearly zero link between how the timocratic state emerges from the ideal and the random fact that the timocratic dude happens to be the kid of a retired statesman.

the next two stages in the decline of constitutions have even less solid history behind ‘em. honestly, there’s zilch in greek history showing a squad like the spartan or cretan morphing into a straight-up wealthy oligarchy, or that rich oligarchy flipping into a democracy. the flow of history was way different; in homeric times, there was that royal or patriarchal swag, which a century or two later got replaced by an oligarchy of birth rather than of cash, where wealth was just the byproduct of inherited land and power. sometimes this oligarchical government would dip and yield to a property-based rule—which, according to aristotle’s wordplay, would be dubbed a timocracy—and in some cities like athens, that setup became the launchpad to full democracy. but this isn’t the guaranteed level-up sequence for states; in fact, you can’t catch any clear order in the endless flip-flopping of greek history (like the tides on the euripus), except maybe that original trend from monarchy to aristocracy in the old days. at first glance, it even seems like there’s a similar twist in the last step of plato’s succession; because tyranny, instead of being democracy’s natural endgame, shows up in early greek lore more as a pit stop leading to democracy. think of peisistratus and his sons—their reign sits squarely between solon’s dropping of the laws and kleisthenes’ reboot—and some secret sauce seems to have pushed most of hellas (athens, argos, corinth, sicyon, and nearly every state except sparta) through a similar tyranny phase that eventually morphed into either an oligarchy or democracy. but remember, plato’s really just dishing about the then-current sicilian states, which were all about the democracy-vs-tyranny remix, not exactly the ancient histories of athens or corinth.

the portrait of the tyrant himself is straight-up the same as the later greek vibes drawn of phalaris and dionysius—like, in medieval saint legends or mythic hero sagas, one dude’s wild antics get credited to another to fill out the story profile. there wasn’t a wild deed the greeks didn’t be hyping about; the tyrant was basically the anti-gov, law-diss, ultimate negative flex. his assassination was seen as gloriously epic, and no matter how extra or unnatural a crime was, they’d probably pin it on him. in this whole vibe, plato was just riding the common thought wave among his country homies, and he maxed it out with his genius-level exaggerations. there’s zero reason to think he was spitting straight-life facts or that he was even tight with dionysius himself—the way he disses them makes you doubt he ever hung with those trolls or cooked up the wild schemes (as the epistles claim) to reboot sicily using their help.

plato goes full hyperbolic and serio-comic mode to roast the dumb moves of democracy that he sees spilling over into everyday social life. to him, democracy is like a state of extreme individualism or complete chaos, where everyone’s just doing whatever they think is right. that squad of peeps, supposedly united by a shared liberty vibe—rising as one to yeet the persian horde, which herodotus and thucydides be all about—never even seemed to light up in his mind. but if he’s not vibing with liberty, he’s even less about that tyranny life. his deepest, savage shade is aimed at the tyrant, who is the poster child for wickedness and weakness—a dude so caught up in his own helpless, paranoid drama that he’s forced into an impossible grind, lacking even a sliver of good mojo, which, in plato’s opinion, is needed to give power to evil (book i). this picture of wickedness stuck in miserable struggle is the complete reversal of that other dreamlike image of perfect injustice ruling in all-out happiness and glam—a vibe originally sketched out by thrasymachus and later by the sons of ariston—and it’s also the flip side of the king whose whole rule is solely about the good of his squad.

each of these governments and individuals comes with its own ethical tier vibe: the ideal state is ruled by reason, which doesn’t snuff out but totally syncs and trains the passions into virtue; in timocracy (and with the timocratic homie), whether state or self, the playbook is first about courage and then about chasing honor (that latter virtue might not even be that lit, but it’s what’s taking over). in the next decline stage, virtues straight-up vanish, replaced by a mad love for cash; and in the final stage—democracy—every passion is free to go off, with both virtues and vices getting equal airtime. but this kind of unbridled freedom, which spawns all sorts of extra weird quirks, is really just a sign of weakness and total dissipation. finally, one mega monster passion takes over a person’s entire vibe—that’s tyranny. in all these cases, too much excess—first cash, then that wild freedom—is exactly what steers everything into decay.

book eight of the republic is lit with life pics and wild allusions; plato goes full meme with metaphors more than anywhere else in his work. check it: (1) he drops the deets on two nations in one, where the greek republics are splitting more and more, like feudal chaos on replay—and maybe even like what’s poppin’ in our own world; (2) he serves up a pythagorean formula for democracy, spitting equality among the totally unequal; (3) he vibes on the free, chill moves of both people and animals, marking that as the hallmark of liberty, just as foreign mercenaries and universal distrust scream tyrant; (4) and he even proposes that straight-up debts shouldn’t be legally recoverable—a theory reformers have lowkey juggled in modern law, matching today’s legislative feels. debt and land were the OG headaches for ancient lawgivers; nowadays, we might’ve almost cracked the debt issue, but land remains super sus.

even crazier are the portraits of individuals: think of the fam snapshot of the timocratic dude’s parents and old servant, contrasted with the outward stiff respectability and inherent nastiness of the oligarch squad; then there’s the wild, unfiltered freedom of the democrat—where young alcibiades is all over the place, doing whatever’s lit (or not), and eventually bouncing like a prodigal to a far-off remix zone (peep the wordplay where the democratic dude is painted as a state with its very own citadel and embassy). plus, there’s that unleashing of wild-beast mode in his successor. throw in the savage clapback of the tyrant being a parricide; his life getting painted as a trippy, obscene fever dream; that jaw-dropping moment in book ix where one dude’s misery hits rock bottom; the hint for poets that if they’re vibing with tyrants, they got no seat in a proper constitutional state—‘cause they’re way too woke to not see they deserve to be yeeted; and that constant image of two types of drone squads, eventually morphing into one giant, winged monster drone (book ix)—these are straight-up plato’s peak flex moments.

now let’s dive into the mega head-scratcher of this book: the so-called number of the state. this puzzle is almost as wild as the beast number in revelations, and even though aristotle peeped it, cicero called it a straight-up proverb of obscurity. some peeps thought there was literally no answer, like plato was just messing with his readers. but that kind of cap doesn’t jibe with how aristotle talks about the number—and any reader clued into greek math would have called it out as totally sus. there’s barely any reason to think plato purposely wrote in riddles; the obscurity just comes from us not being on point with the subject. plus, plato himself hints he isn’t totally serious—dubbing his number a solemn jest from the muses, basically throwing some satirical shade at using numbers as deep symbols. (compare cratylus; protag.)

our shot at decoding this lit passage totally hinges on a deep dive into the actual words; a faint glow comes from a parallel bit in book ix. another assist is from aristotle, who drops an important remark that the later part of the passage (in greek) is all about a solid figure. (pol.—“he just says nothing’s permanent, but everything flips in a cycle; the change kicks off from a base of numbers in a 4:3 ratio; and when you mix that with a 5, you get two harmonies; he means when that figure’s number solidifies.”) you can also snag extra clues from the pythagorean triangle, represented by the numbers 3, 4, and 5—since, in any right-angled triangle, the squares of the two smaller sides add up to the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25).

plato kicks things off by chatting about a perfect or cyclical number (tim.), basically one where the sum of its divisors equals the whole—this is the divine, perfect number where all the smaller cycles are completely synced. then he drops talk about a human, or imperfect, number that’s got four terms and three intervals, all linked in a specific ratio; he flips these into figures, and when pumped up to the third power, they spit out certain number elements that form two “harmonies”—one square and one oblong. but don’t go thinking he’s saying the square vibes with the divine or the oblong with the human cycle; there’s zero hint that the first or divine number stands for the period of the world, or that the second marks the state or humankind’s era like zeller suggests—and yo, the divine number isn’t even mentioned after that (arist.). the second number, though, is the number of generations or births, ruling them in that same mysterious way that the stars vibe over us—or, as the pythagoreans would say, representing opportunity, justice, and marriage through some specific number or shape. probably, this one’s 216.

the text breaks it down by saying these two harmonies add up to 8000. this theory gets some cred ‘cause 8000 was the classic number for spartan citizens (herod.), and that’s pretty much what plato would’ve called “a number that nearly equals a city’s population.” maybe the mysterious vanishing of the spartan squad even sparked his idea that it was the first trigger for state decline. the smaller, square “harmony” of 400 might symbolize the guardians, while the larger, oblong “harmony” stands for the people; and the numbers 3, 4, and 5 could totally be nods to the three orders (or aspects of the soul), the four virtues, and the five types of government. plus, the overall harmony of the musical scale—used elsewhere as a vibe for state harmony—is dropped here too, since the numbers 3, 4, and 5 (which form the pythagorean triangle) also map out the intervals of a scale.

now, let’s break down these terms like they’re hot meme seasoning. a perfect number (in greek), as we already peeped, is one where the sum of its divisors equals the whole—so 6 is the OG perfect or cyclical number since 1 + 2 + 3 gets you 6. then, the greek words for “terms” or “notes” and “intervals” work for both tunes and numeric figures. the greek term for “base” is basically the foundation on which the whole calculation rides, or the lowest term you start from. these greek words have been translated all kinds of ways—“squared and cubed” (donaldson), “equalling and equalled in power” (weber), or “by involution and evolution” (basically, raising a power and then pulling out the root, as in other translations). numbers get tagged as “like and unlike” (in greek) when the factors or sides of shapes and cubes are or aren’t in the same ratio—like 8 and 27 being 2 cubed and 3 cubed, respectively, and vice versa. then there are “waxing” (or “increasing”) numbers in greek—numbers that are lower than the sum of their own divisors (for example, 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21)—and “waning” (or “decreasing”) numbers, which come right after the sum of their divisors (like 8 and 27 surpass 7 and 13). the phrase translated as “commensurable and agreeable to one another” in greek is just a fancy way of saying they vibe together in the same ratio, as seen in the series 8, 12, 18, 27, where each number is roughly 1.5 times the previous one. the “base” or “fundamental number” that gets a 1/3 boost (1 and 1/3) equals 4/3—kind of like a musical fourth. the greek term here is essentially a “proportion” of numbers, like musical notes, applied either to parts of a single number or to the relationship between different ones. the first harmony is dubbed a “square” number in greek; the second is an “oblong” number—meaning a shape where only the opposite sides are equal. one greek term means “numbers squared from” or “on diameters,” while another greek term means “rational” (omitting fractions) as opposed to one that means “irrational” (including fractions); for instance, 49 is the square of the rational diameter of a shape whose side is 5, while 50 comes from an irrational diameter of the same shape. for a deeper dive into these deets, huge props go to dr. donaldson’s killer article on the platonic number (proc. of the philol. society).

the conclusions he pulls from this brain-busting data go a little something like this, fam. he’s all like, “yo, if we’re vibing that the perfect, divine cycle (boo-yah, the flawless one) represents the world and the glitchy, imperfect cycle represents the state, then check the math: the world flexes on the perfect number 6, and the state is rocking the cube of that number – 216, no cap. and 216 is lit because it’s the product of the last two digits in the platonic tetractys (a seven-term drip: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27). now, if we go full math mode, we get two cube numbers (8 and 27, bruh) and the mean proportionals between these, 12 and 18, drop three intervals and four terms that stack up in a sesqui-altera ratio – each term flexing at 3/2 times the one before, period.”

now peep this next level breakdown: somewhere else he goes, “yo, the first greek vibe is basically (4/3 x 5) all squared – which is equal to 100 x 2 squared over 3 squared, straight math magic. then the second greek vibe, which is like the cube from the same base, gets served as 100 multiplied (alpha) by the rational diameter of 5 minus one (giving you 48, duh), then (beta) by two incommensurable diameters – those OG irrationals 2 and 3, and (gamma) by the cube of 3, that’s 27. add ‘em up (48 + 5 + 27) and multiply by 100 to get 1000 x 2 cubed. so this second harmony is meant to be the cube of the number that the first harmony squares, which means you gotta divide by 3 cubed. translation? first harmony comes in at 400/9, and the second at 8000/27. mind blown, right?”

here’s why im totally vibing with dr. donaldson and schleiermacher on calling 216 the platonic number of births: (1) it perfectly matches the numeral tea dropped earlier (that greek deets, ya know), (2) 216 and its remix versions were straight-up fam to any greek math genius way back, even if it seems sus to our modern eyes, (3) 216 is the cube of 6 and is also the sum of 3 cubed, 4 cubed, and 5 cubed – and those numbers (3, 4, 5) are the ultimate pythagorean squad (like, 9 + 16 = 25, flexing that triangle math), (4) it’s the period of pythagorean metempsychosis – super deep reincarnation vibes, (5) the triple drip (3, 4, 5) lines up with the third, fourth, and fifth notes in the musical scale, pure harmony, (6) 216 equals the product of the cubes of 2 and 3 – the last two gems in the platonic tetractys, (7) legends like plutarch, proclus, and quintilian all dropped hints that the pythagorean triangle was lurking in these texts, so the ancient squad was clearly on the same wavelength, and (8) the pythagorean triangle even got dubbed the “figure of marriage” in greek – like couple goals in geometry.

but yo, even though im down with dr. donaldson on some of this, i ain’t buying his idea that the first (perfect) number is the world and the glitchy human number is the state – and he didn’t drop any legit proof that the second harmony is a cube, either. plus, i don’t vibe with his random assumption that (greek) means “two incommensurables” (just picking 2 and 3 outta thin air). nah, it’s more like, as the previous clause hints, (greek) means two square numbers built on irrational diameters of a shape whose side is 5 (basically 50 x 2, no cap).

the biggest beef with the translation is how the words (greek) are read as “a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by 5.” like, plato’s forcing the numbers of the pythagorean triangle on us once again. yet, the wild coincidences in the numbers that drop afterward are lowkey in favor of his explanation. the first harmony hit at 400 probably shouts “rulers” vibes, while the second funky harmony at 7600 is all about the people.

and now, we bounce from that heavy math hustle. solving that riddle wouldn’t really light up ancient math – the real flex is that plato was throwing out these symbols with serious pythagorean spirit. his overall message? divine creation is totally perfect, fronted by a perfect, cyclical number, while human generation is messy and ruled by glitchy, imperfect numbers. take 5040, for example – that’s the number of citizens in “the laws,” chosen purely for practical reasons (super convenient for splitting up the loot) and it’s made of the first seven digits multiplied together. the dope contrast between perfect and imperfect digits might have been sparked by cycle tweaks first done by meton and then by callippus (yup, callippus was even a plato protégé). even the nitty-gritty details – like the tyrant’s number in book ix (729 = 365 x 2) and that slight fix in 5040/12 from “the laws” – show that those who were hunting order in nature and found it in numbers naturally assumed one would rule over the other. plato was all about numbers having superpower vibes beyond what he peeped around him, and he seriously knew how those little digits (1, 2, 3) dropped massive influence on education. like, he was basically prophetically hinting at later discoveries (shoutout to quetelet and the crew) that numbers are all about numbers – from birth stats to the exact counts of kids based on parents’ ages.

book ix.
last up in our episode is the tyrannical man – that cringe, extra villain-type we gotta inspect. where’s he even from, and does he live on cloud nine or in nonstop misery? hold up though, before we deep dive into his whole vibe, gotta chat about the cravings we all catch. some of these appetites are straight-up outlaw moves, but they can get chilled and even nerfed by reason and law. i’m talking about those wild cravings that wake up when your brain’s in sleep mode – roaming around naked with zero self-respect, throwing shade on any imaginable crime, however extra, they might dream up. “true,” my dude echoes – “facts, for real.”

but then, when a guy’s heart beats chill, and he’s feasted on that rational wisdom so as to vibe with his true self before crashing for the night – and he only snacks just enough to keep his wild desires from wrecking his clear brain – plus, he’s not all caught up in drama and heat, then the dreams he catches on his sleep sesh are mad regular. even the best peeps got that lowkey wild beast nature creeping out in their sleep.

back to the tea: remember what we dropped about the democrat? he was the kid of a super tightwad dad who was all about saving cash and squashing flashy spending. then, the youth ended up rolling with a chill crew, started side-eyeing his dad’s basic, pinched ways, and eventually leveled up into a man who wasn’t about reckless, lawless passion but rather a steady, sequence of indulgence.

now, imagine that this youth turns into a dad, and his kid gets hit with the same temptations – surrounded by a crew pushing him into all sorts of shady iniquity while his fam and pals are out here trying to keep him on the righteous track. the dark advisors of evil realize their only shot to lock him down is to plant a monster vibe in his soul – that over-the-top love – while other cravings buzz around him like bangers dropping on every playlist. but this monster love takes over so hard, it straight-up yeets every authentic or chill thought out of his brain.

love, much like getting wasted or going full cray-cray, becomes a tyranny; and the tyrannical man – whether he’s born that way or molded by his habits – turns into a straight-up animal: chugging drinks, chasing wild lust, and flipping off any vibe of calm.

so how does this dude even live? “nah, you gotta spill the tea,” one might say. well, i’m thinking he’s out here surrounded by wild parties and hook-ups, with love reigning as the uncontested lord of his crib. his endless cravings demand mad coin, so he burns through his cash and even racks up debt; and when he’s broke AF, his young ones (like raven chicks still in the nest) are crying out for sustenance. love rallies them on, and they gotta be satisfied by force or scam – or else they become a huge pain. and as fresh pleasures drop, the son dives in to snatch up his parents’ goods; if they start acting like “nah, we’re good,” he’ll scam 'em outta their assets; and if they outright fight back, well... i’d honestly be like, “yikes, not me.” but, o heavens, adeimantus, can you even believe some extra, out-there love would have him ditch or totally enslave his OG parents – his ride-or-die crew? real talk: a tyrannical son is a twisted blessing to his folks.

when there’s nothing left to squeeze from them, he flips into burglar mode, pickpocketing or even robbing temples. love dominates his mind so hardcore that in the sober daylight he becomes that monstrous beast he sometimes only dreams about in sleep. he goes all out with violence and lawlessness, ready to pull any wild stunt to feed his rabble’s needs. in a well-ordered state, there’s barely a few of these clout-chasers – and in war times, they bounce off as mercenaries for a tyrant. but in peace, they’re stuck at home causing chaos: the thieves, cut-purses, man-stealers, and if they even got a voice, false-witnesses and snitches. a legit catalog of crimes, even if their numbers are low. and sure, “small” and “big” are just labels – none of their shady moves even come close to what the tyrant himself does; a class growing wild and numerous eventually births the tyrant. if the people just tap out, fine; but if they resist, then like how he once clapped his parents, he now claps down on his homeland and crowns his mercenaries over it all. these dudes, in their early days, hang with bootlickers and are masters at flattery to score their ends; but once they don’t need their posse, they ghost them in a flash – forever hovering between being masters and servants, with zero regard for true friendship. they’re viciously treacherous and straight-up unjust, if we even know what justice really means. they bring our worst nightmares to life; and the dude who’s the most tyrant by nature, living that tyrant life the longest, turns out to be the absolute worst of all – and with that, the most miserable.

like man, like state – the tyrannical man is doomed to dish out tyranny, which is the polar opposite of a chill, royal state; one’s the ultimate dream, and the other’s pure dumpster fire. so which vibe is happier? even if the tyrant seems all grand and monstrous with his loyal satellites, let’s not be shy – go in and ask for real. the answer? the monarchical state is the happiest, while the tyrannical state is the most miserable. and yo, can we flip the same question on the men themselves – asking someone who really gets the inner workings of a dude and isn’t shook by empty tyrant posturing? i’m betting on someone who’s lived with the guy in real fam times or seen him in crisis mode.

now, assuming we’re the unbiased judge in this tea sesh, let’s compare the individual and the state. first up: is the state really free or is it all about chains and servitude? will we only see a smidge of freedom mixed with a truckload of slavery? and get this – the freedom is the crappy kind, while the slavery turns out to be the “good” kind; this goes for both the dude and his state. his soul’s hella loaded with meanness and chains, and even his best parts are tied down by worse vibes. he can’t do what he truly wants; his mind’s a messy tangle – the polar opposite of a true freeman. the state ends up broke and drowning in misery and sorrow; similarly, the man’s soul is empty and crying, making him one of the most miserable peeps ever. but hold on – not even the most miserable, ‘cause there’s someone even lower. “who’s that?” – the tyrannical man who, on top of his own mess, ends up a public tyrant. no guesswork here, i’m 100% sure. he’s like a super-rich slave owner – except his crib is stacked with more slaves than any one person should have. you might be thinking, “but owners of slaves aren’t usually scared of their crew,” right? but here’s the kicker: the whole city is like one tight league protecting individuals. now imagine one of these owners gets snatched by a god into the middle of nowhere, where no freemen are around to help – would he not be in total terror, forced to suck up to his slaves and make promises he totally hates? and picture the same god surrounding him with neighbors who be like, “nah, no one should own slaves – and if you do, you deserve a death sentence.” damn, it only escalates – our dude finds himself smack in the middle of enemy turf. and isn’t our tyrant already that captive soul, tormented by a swarm of wild passions he can’t even chill with, stuck indoors like a beta and jelly of those who get to dip out and see the world?

with all these evils stacked up, wouldn’t the most miserable dude be even more wrecked if he had to rock a public gig? master of others when he can’t even master himself; like a sick person forced to run an ultra-marathon; the lowliest of slaves and the crummiest of bootlickers; wanting everything and never getting his fill – always hit with fear and chaos, just like the state he’s supposed to represent. his toxic, jealous, hateful vibe only amps up with power; he turns more disloyal, envious, and crooked – the absolute definition of wretched, a misery for both him and everyone around him. so let’s drop the final verdict – do we need a hype announcer or can i just spit it? as the son of ariston (the dopest) says: the best and most just dudes are also the happiest, ‘cause they totally boss themselves up; whereas the shady, unjust ones are the biggest tyrants of both themselves and their state. and i’m throwing in extra – whether you or the gods peep it or not.

this right here is our first bombproof proof. the second drop comes from breaking down the three kinds of pleasure that vibe with the three core elements of the soul – reason, passion, and desire. under “desire” we pack both the greedy hustle and the sensual cravings, while “passion” covers that ambition drip, party-feels, and mad love for rep. reason, on the flip side, is dead set on snagging truth, giving zero cares about cash or clout. depending on a person’s natural vibe, one of these triads ends up in the driver’s seat, each with its own lit pleasures. ask each side, and they’ll be hyping up their own favs while lowkey trashing the others. the money-maker will diss knowledge as all vanity compared to solid wealth; the ambitious dude will roast any knowledge that doesn’t bring honor; meanwhile, the philosopher only cares about the pure juice of truth, calling other pleasures “necessary” instead of straight-up good. so how do we choose the ultimate vibe? is there any better judge than straight-up experience and wisdom? which of these three squads holds the truest knowledge and sickest experience? youth makes the philosopher savvy to both kinds of desire, while the greedy and ambitious never even get a taste of true wisdom – even if they claim honour, they’re forever judged by it, while not really living it. reason’s the ultimate tool here, while the others just flex on cash and clout; so if we measure by reason, then the philosopher’s goods are the real deal. long story short, the pleasure from leveling up your rational soul – living that truth-rich life – is the dopest vibe of all. next up is the hustle of ambition, and wrapping it out is the grind of money-making.

twice has the just homie yeeted the unjust into oblivion – like, in a legit olympian smackdown, first dropping a prayer on savior zeus so he can try that epic fail. a wise fam once slid into my dms saying that the real vibes of the wise are 100% pure and no cap, while all the other flexes are just shadow clones. let’s break it down: isn’t pleasure always lowkey clashing with pain, with a chill midzone that’s neither lit nor lame? when a dude’s sick, nothing slaps harder than that health drip – but he never peeped that when he was cruising at 100. in pain, he only craves an immediate yeet from the hurt; but when he’s riding a pleasure high, even chill mode feels like a major glitch. so, rest or a full timeout is both a sweet vibe and a harsh burn. but can that middle vibe, which is neither, magically flip into both? again, pleasure and pain are in constant motion, and when they ghost out, that’s what we call chill mode; but then, how does the absence of one vibe suddenly become the other? yo, this whole contradiction is just a mad optical illusion—a total sensory hack. plus, there’s a whole squad of other pleasures that don’t even come with a pain intro. so pure pleasure ain’t merely a no-pain flex, nor is pure pain just the zero-pleasure state; even though most of the body’s pleasure is basically a spicy pain relief, complete with pre-game hype and post-drop aftershocks. think of it like this savage simile: nature’s got an upper tier, a lower tier, and a midzone, and anyone sliding from the bottom to the midzone thinks they’re already bossin’ in the upper league; and if they get dragged back down, they legit feel like they’re freefalling. all this crazy remix comes from not knowing the real deal about the upper, mid, and lower zones. and the same epic confusion happens with pleasure and pain—and a whole bunch of other stuff. the dude who tries to mix grey with black ends up calling grey straight-up white; and the one who peeps a no-pain state as pure pleasure is basically remixing pain into pleasure. again, hunger and thirst are just basic body glitches, while ignorance and dumb vibes rule the soul; food satisfies the body while knowledge feeds the soul. so, which is the real flex—the tasty drip of food or that next-level wisdom download? peep it: the satisfaction from what’s hella real (with more existence) is 100% deeper than that from what’s just a vibe. the unchanging and immortal is mad more substantial than the cray variable and mortal, and it comes with a matching flex of truth and knowledge. the soul, no cap, has way more real-deal existence and knowledge than the body, so it stays naturally on that high vibe. meanwhile, those stuck chowing down only on earthly snacks are forever bouncing around between the midzone and the low zone; they never hit the true upper world, nor ever taste the drip of genuine pleasure. they’re basically fat, gluttonous beasts drowning in sensuality and ready to go savage on each other for their never-ending lust, ‘cause they’re missing that true inner glow and their vessel is totally leak-mode (gorgias). their pleasures are just ghostly shadows—mixed with pain, amped up by constant contrast, and so insanely craveable that peeps end up beefing over them, just like stesichorus said when the greeks went to war over helen’s shadow at troy—‘cause they seriously had no clue about what’s real.

yo, same tea goes for that passionate energy: the cravings of the ambitious soul and the ones chasing mad coin are on a totally lower satisfaction level. only when these wild drives get schooled by reason do they run their own show and hit that natural pleasure note. if they’re off their game, they make the other parts of the soul chase a bogus, shadowy pleasure that ain’t even theirs. and the further you drift from philosophy and that deep reason drip, the further you end up from law and order, making your feels even more elusive. the cravings for lovey-dovey warmth and full-on tyranny are the farthest from the legal flex, while the king’s desires are super close to that order. there’s one 100% authentic pleasure and two fake, wannabe ones—the tyrant even goes past the fakes; he’s totally bailed on law and reason. and his low-key cringe level can only be shown in a math flex. the tyrant is like three hops removed from the oligarch, so he ain’t just missing the oligarch’s vibe—he’s rocking just the shadow of a shadow. and the oligarch? he’s three steps away from the king, meaning we hit up this 3 x 3 formula that represents a surface area, showing that the tyrant’s pleasure is literally a weak echo compared to the king’s flex. if you wanna yeet this ‘number of the beast’ into a cube, you get 729; that’s saying the king is 729 times more hyped and happy than the tyrant, no cap. and get this: that insane number is pretty much the same as the days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730), so it’s all about real human vibes. this gap is just the happiness interval between a good dude and a bad dude—imagine the epic difference in lifestyle, drip, and virtue!

maybe you remember someone dropping the bomb at the start of our chat—like, an unjust dude could score major clout if he repped justice well. now that we’ve decoded both justice and injustice, let’s flex a mental image of the soul to personify those words. first up, craft a beast with a bunch of heads—a whole ring of animal doms, from tame sidekicks to wild legends, all ready to flip forms on a whim. then, imagine throwing in a lion form and a human form; the lion is the boss level and the human form is like a mini upgrade—each smaller than the one before. mash ‘em together and cover the whole mess with human skin so the beastly switches stay totally undercover. once you’re done, tell that injustice booster that he’s basically fattening the beast squad while leaving the real human star starving. on the flip, the justice keeper is all about powering up the inner human; he’s feeding that gentle core and linking up with a lion-heart alliance so he can keep that many-headed hydra in check and squad up all the inner parts into one unified vibe. bottom line? whether it’s about pleasure, clout, or straight-up advantage, the just homie is always on point while the unjust is major sus.

alright, now let’s vibe with the unjust, even if they ain’t tripping on purpose. isn’t it the noble part that keeps the beast in check, channeling that godlike drip within the man, while the lowkey ignoble part lets the man get ruled by basic animal instincts? so, who’s gonna get paid if it means trashing the most epic part of themselves for the lowest of the low? like, who’d sell off their kid for some cash to savage brutal vibes, or offload their pure, divine essence to the nastiest, most vile crew? that’s worse than eriphyle, who traded her hubby’s life for a lame necklace. losing control lets that wild, many-faced monster run free; while pride and sulkiness just pump up the lion and snake energy, and extra luxury plus extra softness come from letting your spirit go on too hard a chill. when your fiery inner squad gets forced into greedy mode, you end up dropping fake flattery and meanness, turning that lion into a basic monkey. the real shame in the craft game is that the hustlers have to butter up and vibe with others instead of bossing over their own desires; that’s why we say they need to be reined in by a stronger inner force, ‘cause they ain’t got one on deck—this isn’t about hurting the squad, it’s for their own epic glow-up. and our mission for the young ones? to school them up in self-control; the law’s all about nurturing a higher vibe in them so that once they nail that, they can roll out on their own and flex big time.

so, what’s the gain if a dude bags the whole world and still turns wicked? or what’s the flex in dodging the heat if keeping shady moves on the low stops you from getting fixed? if he had taken a hit for his misdeeds, the brute inside would’ve been shut down and the chill, gentle vibes unleashed—merging temperance, justice, and wisdom into one bomb-ass squad within his soul, a union way tighter than any physical drip. the wise homie puts knowledge on a pedestal above all; next up, he makes sure to keep his body on point not just for health and strength, but to vibe in a perfect sync with his soul. when it comes to stacking cash, he’s chasing order and harmony—he ain’t tryna hoard mad wealth without a plan, ‘cause he fears that an overload of cash might mess up his inner constitution. that’s why he only grabs honors that seriously level him up as a dude; any extra clout he just yeets away. “in that case,” he’d say, “i’ll never be a politricks dude.” true, but he might still keep it 100 in his own hood—even if not in his hometown, unless fate pulls a wild divine curve. “so you’re saying he’ll be a citizen of that ultimate ideal city that doesn’t even exist on earth?” exactly—‘cause up in heaven there’s a blueprint for that perfect city, and if you’re down, you can model your whole life after that epic design. whether that state ever drops IRL is chill; the point is to ride that pattern and nothing else.

alright, here are the top key takeaways in book 9 of the republic, fam: 
(1) the lowdown on pleasure; 
(2) the math flex that splits the king’s vibe from the tyrant’s drag; 
(3) the blueprint chillin’ in the heavens.

(1) yo, plato’s take on pleasure is all about keeping it balanced—he ain’t out here hating on every good vibe like some later platonists or how aristotle dished it up. he’s not like the cynics who diss all pleasure; he just wants every part of your soul to get its natural fix. he even chills with the epicureans, saying that pleasure is more than just a no-pain state. real talk: some pleasures roll in without any pre-game pain (like he drops in the philebus), think killer scents and that hype of hope and anticipation. in his previous drop, he split pleasure into must-haves and extras—a move that aristotle later echoed—and now he even calls out a whole extra class of wild beast pleasures (big ups to aristotle’s greek flex). he’s all about showing that our sensory pleasures are basically an illusion cooked up by the contrast of pain and pleasure, while the slow-chill vibes of reason are way superior to those fleeting sense-and-feel flexes. the crown level of royal pleasure is lit ‘cause reason is the only squad that can actually judge the lower vibes, while the other two parts of the soul are too busy being basic. so in his deep-dive on pleasure, plato’s philosophy got literally chopped into numbers by aristotle; his OG analysis became the solid foundation for later techy distinctions. both plato and aristotle peeped how the ancients tripped over the fact that just ‘cause a pleasure is short-lived doesn’t mean it’s fake, and they mistakenly mixed up the forever vibes of intellectual pleasure with the unshakeable truth behind the knowledge fueling them. real talk: the pleasure of knowledge, although hella elevating, isn’t forever and is pretty much as subject to our bod’s mood swings as any other vibe (introduction to philebus, fam).

(2) check it: the gap between the king’s epic vibe and the tyrant’s whack feels is a solid 729—that’s the cube of 9, no cap. plato was all about that number ‘cause it’s basically the human life cheat code, almost matching the days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730, close enough). this gap is strictly for the happiness scale between a dope dude and a sus one—imagine the savage difference in life’s drip and virtue!

(3) as we wrap up the republic, plato’s getting more and more hella convinced that his ideal vibes are the real-deal. by the end of book 9, that heavenly blueprint replaces the philosopher-king city on earth. the vision he carefully crafted turns out to be out there on another level, yet it’s still the guiding rule for every human hustle. (peep that iconic line: “say not lo! here, or lo! there, for the kingdom of god is within you.”) this major mic drop sets the stage for the next book’s future life flex; but truth be told, that future life is popping off right now—real politics starts with leveling up your inner self.

book x.
yo, i was vibin’ with a ton of stuff about our state’s order, but nothing hit as different as the rules on poetry. the way the soul gets split into parts totally illuminates why we kick out copycat imitations. real talk: all poetry is kinda an assault on the brain, unless the listeners are armed with that healing drip of knowledge to fix their errors. i’ve been stanring homer since i was a kid, and even now, he’s the ultimate boss of tragic poetry. but as much as i love the man, truth always wins, so i gotta spill: first off, can someone break down what imitation even means? ‘how likely then that i should understand!’ might be, ‘cause sometimes the less flashy eye sees deeper, ya know? ‘true, but around you, my brain’s too shook to drop my thoughts.’ so let’s kick it old school with the doctrine of universals. imagine there’s a vibe for beds and tables—one perfect idea that every maker had in mind when crafting them; he didn’t invent the ideal of a bed or table, he just built them based on that ultimate template. and yo, isn’t there a master creator behind all things—the dude who not only makes your everyday gear but also the plants, animals, earth, heaven, and everything in between? he even crafts the gods. ‘dude’s a straight-up wizard!’ but check it: you could do the same—grab a mirror, catch the sun’s reflection, the earth, or anything else, and boom, you’ve made a copy. ‘yeah, but that’s just on the surface.’ exactly; the painter is like a mirror-wielding creator, even more unreal than a carpenter, since no artist really makes the absolute perfect bed. ‘unless, of course, philosophers spill the tea.’ no wonder the painter’s bed only has a half-ass link to the ultimate truth. think on this: we got three types of beds—one in nature made by god, one crafted by the carpenter, and one slapped together by the painter. god only dropped one original, ‘cause if there were two, there’d always be a third, even more abstract and boss-level that would include the others under its umbrella. so, god’s the natural bed maker, and the carpenter’s down there doing his thing—but the painter? he’s just out here imitating what the others built, meaning his creation is like three hops away from real reality. and the tragic poet? just another imitator, like every other copycat, three levels removed from the original king vibe and pure truth. the painter isn’t replicating the OG bed, but the carpenter’s version. and even though they ain’t truly different, they look diff because they got all these layers, and the painter only snags one piece—a mere image representing a slice of the whole. he can even copy other artists without really knowing their game, and do it well enough to fool basic peeps and kids. now, imagine someone comes up saying they met a dude who knew everything everyone does—and then some. shouldn’t we call that guy a total simp, lacking real discernment, who got bamboozled by some wizard-like enchanter he thought was all-wise? and when folks crow that homer and the tragedians rule all arts and virtues, aren’t they riding a similar delusional wave? they don’t see that poets are just imitators, and their creations are nothing but fakes. deadass. but if someone could both create and mimic, they’d rather drop a masterpiece that lasts instead of just a knockoff; they’d rather be hyped up than just handing out cheap clout. yeah, ‘cause that’s how you stack major honor and advantage.

aight fam, time to grill homer and all his poet homies. yo, homer, listen up: i ain't tryna chat about no medicine or any random art vibes your poems casually drop, but i'm all about that real tea—war, military flex, and straight-up politics, no cap. if you're only like two steps removed from the truth and not some third-rate fake, drop the deets: what epic good have you ever done for humanity? any city out there flexin' that they got laws straight from you—like sicily and italy did with charondas, sparta with lycurgus, athens with solon? or did any war even get lit up by your pro tips? maybe any invention's been credited to you like thales or anacharsis? or did you ever school dudes on a homeric lifestyle—think pythagorean vibes—and now have that fire style named after you? nah, fr; and creophylus (flesh-child) got even more clapped in his pedigree than his name suggests—word on the street is that homer himself was left ghosted and starving by him and his crew.

but yo, if homer was legit the teacher of hellas, wouldn't he have had a whole squad of ride-or-die followers? like, if protagoras and prodicus can convince peeps that no one can run a crib or a state without their vibes, how could homer and hesiod just yeet around as total beggars—if they were actually dropping knowledge bombs, dudes would be tailing them for that free edu, no cap. but they didn't; so we gotta deduce that homer and all those poets are straight-up copycat wannabes, just mimicking the surface-level drip of reality. 

just as a dope painter, with his flex on figure and color, can whip up a cobbler without ever knowing how to cobble, the poet can splash any art in lit language hues, droppin' dope beats and vibes on both the cobbler and the general, ya feel? and real talk, plain narration without that sick meter is like a face that lost its glow—like, that once-fresh vibe gone forever. bottom line: the imitator never gets the real tea—it’s all just frosted appearance. the painter slaps on his art, the craftsman builds a bridle and reins, but neither really knows how to ride— that’s strictly the horse rider’s gig, and same goes for all that other stuff. so here’s the tea: we got three arts—a genuine art of use, another for dope invention, and a third that’s just clout on imitation; and the actual user is the real boss, setting the rules for the other two. a flute-player will peep the vibes between a lit flute and a trash one, and its maker will trust that drip; but the imitator? he’s straight-up clueless—no solid science or legit opinion belongs to him. imitation is nothing but a lame game, a goofy sport, and tragic plus epic poets are peak copycats, maxed out on fake drip.

now let's peep the scoop: what part of us even vibes with imitation? check it—stuff looks totally diff when it's in water versus out, when it's close as heck versus far away; and our painter or street juggler uses that flip to mess with our eyeballs. then comes the art of measuring, weighing, and calculating to rescue our brain from those trippy appearances—cause, like, two opposing opinions on the same thing at the same time just can't both be lit. which one's the real deal is all about that calculation game, tied up with the top-tier part of your soul, while imitation vibes are low-key trash. same goes for your ears as for your eyes, for poetry as for painting. imitation covers moves you make on purpose or even by accident, where you're expecting an epic win or a mega fail, and you're riding those high feels or crashing in pain. but is a dude ever really vibing with himself when he's caught in these conflicting feels? isn't that just extra contradictory energy? 

lemme also ask—does a bro chill his sorrow more when he's solo or when he's with his crew? answer: definitely when he's rolling with his squad. his feels might push him to indulge in all that sadness, but reason and the rulebook step in to flex patience; 'cause he can't even peep if his pain is a blessing or a curse, and honestly, nothing human is that clutch while all that sorrow is a straight-up buzzkill for smart moves. when we trip, we shouldn't go cray cray like toddlers; we gotta do the reason-approved moves—skip the crying, get that fix. most of us are down to ride with reason, while our irrational side is busy drowning in its own sad playlist of drama. sadly, though, that irrational vibe fuels the raw material for copycat art. reason stays chill and lowkey, never out here flexing hard—especially for a mixed crowd who's clueless about her vibe. so, the poet's basically like that painter with two major fails: first, he drops a watered-down version of the truth, and second, he only taps into a lame corner of the soul. he's all about feeding the feels while ghosting reason; and we ain't letting him boss our minds—'cause he got zero rep in knowing what's lit and what's not, just spitting out images and drifting far from the real truth.

but yo, we haven't even hit the baddest charge yet—the fact that poetry can straight-up rage our feels in a harmful way. when we catch a verse where a hero goes on and on about his pain, we vibe with him and hype the poet; but then when we get emo ourselves, that same deep feels session gets clapped as weak and unmanly (ion). now, should a dude be hyped watching someone else do what he totally despises in himself? isn't he sliding into the same feels he's supposed to control? he's off his guard 'cause it's someone else's sorrow, thinking he can ride his emotions without looking extra, and score a win from that pleasure swap. but real talk: if you start crying over someone else's drama, you'll eventually drown in your own. same goes for comedy—you might be LOLing at clown moves you'd be too embarrassed to drop yourself, and that obsession with lowkey crude stage humor might just transform you into a full-on clown in real life. poetry basically pours water on your passions, letting them go savage, bossing you around instead of you being the boss. so when homer hype crew claim he's the ultimate teacher of hellas and that all life should run on his ethos, we can respect their good intentions and admit that homer was indeed a dope poet and tragedian. but, real talk, we're never gonna let any poetry that steps outside pure hymns to the gods or praise for big names slide—'cause in our state, it's not about pleasure and pain, it's about law and reason ruling the show.

now, these are our grounds for booting out shady poetry; but so she doesn't call us out for being rude, let's drop a quick apology too. we'll remind poetry that there's been an ancient beef between her and philosophy—spotted all over poet scrolls, like that line about "the she-dog, yelping at her mistress," and the vibes of "philosophers ready to dodge zeus" and "philosophers who are paupers." still, we hold no hard feelings and will totally let poetry slide back in if she can drop a sick defense in verse; and her non-poet homies can spill their tea in straight prose. we admit she’s got mad charm; but if she can’t prove she's both useful and delightful—like a smart bae—we gotta ghost that love, even if she was our first meme crush. grown folks know poetry ain't the gospel, and a dude’s gotta be extra cautious on how he brings her into his vibe or state of being—'cause we're talkin' major stakes here: the ultimate good or bad of a human soul. and it's totally not worth ditching justice and virtue for some sketchy poetic attractions, any more than you'd sacrifice honor or cash for clout. i feel you, bro.

and yet, the rewards of virtue are way bigger than i've even dropped. "and can we even vibe with things greater still?" maybe not in this short life—but would an immortal even care about anything less than eternal flex? "dude, i'm not catchin' your drift." c'mon, don't you know the soul's forever? "you can't be playin'—prove it." oh, i gotchu: everything's got a mix of good and bad vibes. every squad element comes with its own built-in corruption—and if that can't wreck it, nothing else will. the soul's also packing its own toxic feels—like injustice, overindulgence, and major coward moves—but none of that straight-up kills the soul like a virus wrecks your bod. the soul might be chock-full of shady sins, but that ain’t gonna bring it any closer to the ultimate game over. nothing that isn’t broke from the inside ever gets smoked by outside bad vibes. your bod, being one thing, can't be trashed just by munching on food—unless that grub's toxic enough to pass on the downfall. and likewise, the soul won't catch those dirty vibes from the body unless it's already infected. since bodily evils can't mess with the soul, not even sickness or violence or any other chaos can wreck it—unless they literally turn it unholy and mad unjust. and no one’s ever gonna prove that souls level up in injustice when they dip out of life. if some fool dares to say otherwise, then why do criminals need an executioner instead of just dying on their own? real talk: "injustice wouldn't be that savage if it ended all bad vibes; but i lowkey think that the injustice which offends others might actually hyp up the life of the unfair ones." you nailed it. if sin—its own natural, inherent badness—can’t kill the soul, then nothing else is gonna, no cap. so a soul that’s unkillable by both inner and outer drama has gotta be forever, immortal and eternal. and if that's true, souls are a fixed squad: they can’t drop in number because they're unbreakable, nor can they multiply, 'cause any addition would have to come from something mortal—which means the immortal squad stays constant. plus, the soul ain't some wild remix; anything immortal's gotta be pure, simple, and clean af. if we really wanna peep the soul, and see justice and injustice for what they truly are, we gotta see it through that pure light of reason—fresh like at birth, or as it vibes in deep convos with the divine and eternal. but right now, all we peep of her is like the sea god glaucus—wrecked and bruised in this messy world sea, plastered with shells and stones from all the extra earthly distractions.

so far, as our argument called for, we haven't even dropped the epic rewards and honors that poets heap on justice; we've just been showing that justice in itself is the ultimate self-care for the soul—even if a dude rocks a gyges’ ring and even sports hades' helmet. now, it's payback time: you gotta return what you owe me, and i'mma list the dope rewards of justice in life and after death. i conceded, just for argument's sake, that evil might sometimes dodge the gods' and mortals' radar—even though that's totally impossible. and since i've shown that justice is the real deal, you gotta admit she also slays on looks. first off, the just dude is on the gods' vip list, making him their bestie, so he gets hooked up with every good vibe, except for the minor shade that's the necessary fallout from past sins. everything wraps up super good for him, whether in life or the afterlife—even if it looks like crap—'cause the gods got mad love for anyone who craves their likeness. and what about us mortals? ain't honesty the ultimate flex? that sly trickster might kick off strong, but then totally crumbles before hitting the finish line and bails in disgrace, while the true runner grinds it out, finishing strong and snatching the prize. and let me rehash all those blessings you dished out for the lucky unjust—they run the city, can wed whoever they want; meanwhile, the troubles you gave the unlucky just actually end up slapping the unjust, even though their pain stays lowkey and silent as you hinted.

but yo, all the perks of this life are straight-up noobs compared to what the righteous get after death. "i wanna hear that deets." so, roll with me as i drop the epic tale of er, son of armenius—a total legend. supposed to have clocked out in battle, but ten days later his body popped up, untouched by any decay, and got sent home for a proper burial. on day twelve, they tossed him onto the funeral blaze, and boom—he woke up again and spilled the tea on what he saw in the underworld. he dropped that his soul rolled deep with a massive squad to a spot with two paired chasms underground and two matching gaps up in the heavens. in that midzone, judges were chillin', ordering the just to level up through the heavenly right lane—complete with their judgment seal—while the unjust, sporting a fail seal on the back, got forced down the left lane. they told him to peep the scene and tune in, 'cause he was chosen to be the messenger for the peeps back on earth. he watched as souls bounced out after judgment at both chasms; some coming from earth looked all worn out and travel-stained, while those hailing from heaven were sparkling clean and bright. they were hyped to kick it in a chill meadow, swapping stories about the wild sights of the other realm. the earth squad wept over old sorrows, while the sky spirits rapped about epic, heavenly bliss. he spilled that every bad deed got hit with a tenfold punishment—real talk, the journey lasted a thousand years (since a human life is just a hundred years)—and the rewards of virtue scaled the same way. he even dropped some extra tea about how newborns barely got to flex before they dipped—seriously, not even worth the repost. for patricides and other murder jerks, he had tortures so savage they make your head spin. 

he even peeped one spirit ask, "where's ardiaeus the great?" (yeah, that ardiaeus was a brutal tyrant who offed his dad and big bro like a thousand years back). another spirit clapped back, "he ain't rolling up here, and won't ever, period. and yo, i saw it live—at the chasm's edge, just as we were about to bounce back, ardiaeus popped up with a crew of sinners (most being ex-tyrants, but not the whole squad), and just when they thought they were getting a life reboot, the chasm let out a mega roar. then, these wild, fiery-lookin' dudes who totally knew that sound swooped in, grabbed him and a bunch of others, tied them up from head to toe, threw them down, and dragged them along the road—slicing and shredding them like cheap wool—while telling onlookers they were about to get yeeted into hell." the biggest scare for the pilgrims climbing was that they'd hear that savage roar; so whenever it went silent, one by one they bounced upward in pure joy. and for every epic suffering, there was a matching set of dope delights.

on the 8th day the pilgrim souls were lowkey built different as they resumed their journey, and in 4 days they rolled up to a spot where they peeped a lit line of light—think rainbow vibes but extra bright and clear. one more day and they landed at the spot, realizing this was the cosmic light beam that holds the entire universe together. the ends of this beam were strapped to heaven, and from ‘em dangled necessity’s ultimate distaff, where every heavenly body spun like they were on a dope turntable—the hook and spindle were made of straight-up adamant flex, and the whorl was crafted from a mixed-up substance. this whorl looked like a stack of boxes fitting into each other with their edges flipped skyward, forming one epic spiral pierced by the spindle. the outer ring had the broadest rim, while each inner loop got smaller and narrower. the biggest one (the fixed stars) was spangled with mad sparkles—the 7th (the sun) was the brightest flex—the 8th (the moon) glowed thanks to the sun’s drip—the 2nd and 5th (saturn and mercury) were like twins on a yellow vibe, even more yellow than the moon—the 3rd (jupiter) shone in the whitest glow—the 4th (mars) was red af—and the 6th (venus) served as the runner-up for whiteness. the whole assembly moved as one smooth squad, but while the outer revolution spun one way, the 7 inner circles ghosted in the opposite direction, each at its own pace—some fast, some slow. the spindle spun on necessity’s own knees, and on each circle a siren dropped banging hymns, while lachesis, clotho, and atropos—the necessity daughters—chilled on equally spaced thrones, singing about the past, present, and future in perfect sync with the sirens’ tunes; clotho would occasionally guide the outer circle with a slick right-hand move, atropos would use her left to steer the inner circles, and lachesis would sometimes pop her hand out to help direct both. when the crew landed, they bounced over to lachesis, where an interpreter was waiting to squad them up, pulling lots and life samples from her knee stash, then hopping up on a pulpit to drop, “yo, mortal souls, listen up to lachesis, daughter of necessity. a fresh period of mortal life has just dropped, and you can pick any divine vibe you like; the choice is all on you—no cap, god ain’t to blame.” after that, he yeeted lots among them and each soul grabbed the lot that landed closest. then, he laid out a whole buffet of life samples on the ground—way more than the number of souls in the squad—including all sorts of lives, both human and animal. there were tyrannies that ended in epic misery and exile, lives of men and women famous for their wild qualities, and mixed-up existences blending wealth with poverty, sickness with health. here, glaucon, is the ultimate risk of human life, so the entire education game should be all about scoring the knowledge that teaches a dude how to ghost evil vibes and pick only the good. he’s gotta know every remix life serves—beauty teamed with poverty or with riches, knowledge paired with external clout—and finally choose a life that vibes with the soul, because that’s the only level that truly upgrades a man while ditching all the extra baggage. and a dude must roll out into the world with an ironclad sense of truth and right, so he doesn’t get blinded by cash or petty temptations, and stays committed to avoiding extremes by riding the mean. for this, as the messenger reported word from the interpreter, is the real flex of human happiness; as he dropped, anyone who chooses smart can snag a dope lot—even if they end up last. “yo, don’t let the first dude be careless with his choice, and the last one don’t go into full despair.” when he finished, the guy who snagged the first lot ended up choosing tyranny—clueless that he was doomed to yeet his own kids—and when he finally caught on, he wept and thumped his chest, throwing the blame on chance, the gods, and anyone else but himself. this dude had rolled in from heaven and, in his past life, was a member of a well-ordered state, but he was stuck in routine with zero philosophy. like many others, he made a trash pick because he was hella inexperienced, while those who had come up from earth and seen some real grime were in no rush to decide. but if a man had been vibing with philosophy on earth and had a moderately chill lot, he might not only be happy here but his pilgrimage to and from this realm would be smooth and heavenly. nothing was more extra than the whole spectacle of choice—at once sad, hilarious, and surreal—with most souls just trying to avoid repeating their last life’s cringe. he even peeped orpheus’s soul morphing into a swan because the dude wasn’t about to be born of a woman; there was thamyras flipping into a nightingale; musical birds, just like the swan, choosing to level up as humans; the 20th soul—ajax—opted for a lion’s roar over human life as a savage callback to past injustices in battle; and agamemnon, mad at the whole human vibe, transformed into an eagle. near the middle, atalanta’s soul picked the honours of an athlete, and right beside her epeus took on the vibe of a workwoman; at the tail end, thersites was turning himself into a monkey. and at the very end, odysseus rolled in looking for the lot of a lowkey private dude—the one neglected and dissed—and when he found it, he dipped out hyped, saying that even if he’d been first instead of last, his pick would’ve stayed the same. on top of that, dudes were also seen flipping into animals, with wild and tame critters switching lanes like it was nothing.

once every soul had snagged their lot, they bounced over to lachesis, who hooked each one up with their personal genius—basically, their cosmic hype squad for fulfilling their destiny. first, she slid them under clotho’s wing, drawing them into the spin cycle of the spindle she commanded; from there, they were shipped over to atropos, who locked in their threads forever with no remix, and then, without so much as a glance back, they cruised past necessity’s throne. after all that, they heat up under scorching vibes as they trek across the plain of forgetfulness before chilling out at night by the river unmindful—whose water was too extra to be contained by any jug. here, each soul downed a set amount of that liquid memory, though some overdid it and ended up with full-blown amnesia—forgetting everything, no cap. even er couldn’t get a sip. later, as they were in full rest mode, mid-night threw down with thunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly the whole squad got yeeted in all directions—shooting off like stars back to their origins. as for bouncing back to the body? the only deets were that when one woke up in the morning, they found themselves straight-up lying on a pyre.

thus, glaucon, the tea is spilled and this epic tale is our ultimate flex if we truly stan that the soul is immortal and we ride hard with the heavenly way of justice and knowledge. so we’ll cruise over the river of forgetfulness clean, staying hella dear to ourselves and the gods, and snag a crown of rewards and pure happiness both in this world and in the next millennial pilgrimage.

the 10th book of plato’s republic splits into two major vibes: first, picking up an old thread that got ghosted, socrates goes off on the poets—who, now that we’ve decoded the soul’s deep drip, are clearly way off the truth train; and second, after flexing the fact that the just are mad happy, he calls for a glow-up in appearances and then drops the ultimate proof that the soul is forever. this argument, much like in the phaedon and gorgias, comes with a side of future-life sneak peeks.

yo, why would plato—who was lowkey a poet himself and whose dialogues are like epic poems and fire dramas—be throwing major shade at poets as a whole, especially the dramatic ones? like, why didn’t he flex that truth can slay in both verse and prose, and that some of life’s wildest vibes can only be dropped in poetry—those mysterious hits of imagination that always squad up with reason? why did he peep epic verse as forever tied to the messy, cringe vibes of old hellenic mythology? and why would he try homer and hesiod on that super basic, prosaic test of utility? these are the tea debates that have been going off among plato scholars forever. while we can’t break down every deet, we can show, first, that his takes naturally came from the extra drama of his era; and second, we can pull out both the glow and the shade in his opinions.

plato’s beef with poets came from the fact that poetry was seriously on the decline in his own time, and as he drops in the laws, a theatrocracy had totally replaced the intellectual elite. euripides was flexing the final chapter of tragic drama, and plato saw him as a bestie to tyrants and the tragic sophist on duty. old-school comedy was practically ghosted, and the fresh new wave hadn’t popped off yet. both dramatic and lyric poetry, just like every branch of greek literature, were getting wrecked by the power of rhetoric. there wasn’t even a “second or third” after aeschylus and sophocles for the next gen. in one of his later comedies (frogs), aristophanes roasted “thousands of tragedy-making chatterboxes,” comparing their weak flexes at poetry to random swallow chirps—claiming their nonstop babble was beyond even euripides—and that they’d pop up on stage only to vanish immediately. for a genius who truly vibed with the godlike aeschylus and the noble, chill sophocles—even if he wasn’t down with all of their theology (rep.)—these “minor poets” were just trash and intolerable af. the dialogues of plato hit hard with the feels of lit decay and crumbling politics that defined his era, and you can’t really expect him to dig the wild limits of aristophanes, who, by the end of his career, had gone from roasting socrates in the clouds to dissing the founders of ideal commonwealths in his eccleziazusae (aka female parliament in the laws).

there’s even more tea on why plato was throwing serious shade at poetry. he peeped the actor’s hustle as a straight-up degradation of human nature—after all, “one dude only lives one life” and can’t legit play a bunch of roles; when an actor dons different characters, it’s like he erases his own vibe, leaving nothing authentic behind. you can’t really live your life and just act it out on stage, right? the actor ends up a slave to his art rather than the boss. with that mindset, plato was extra bold in booting out dramatic poets compared to epic ones, even though he knew that greek tragedians dropped serious lessons in virtue and patriotism that homer just can’t match. but yo, massive dramatic or rhetorical hype often clashes with having a solid mind—big dramatic skills usually come with a weak or messy character on the side.

in book 10, plato rolls out a fresh set of beefs. first up, he claims that any poet or painter is just an imitator, like third-hand removed from the real truth. their creations aren’t measured by any legit rule—they’re just appearances. nowadays, we might say art ain’t just copying but is the vibe expression of the ideal through our senses. even if we rep plato’s modest image, from which his argument gets its color, we gotta keep it 100 that an artist can level up even a plain bed by flexing dope drapery folds or infusing it with that homey feeling; think of modern painters who can drop ideal vibes on a blacksmith’s or carpenter’s shop. an eye or mind that feels as hard as it sees can drop mad dignity and pathos on a busted mill or a straw-built shed (rembrandt style), or on the hull of a ship “rolling up for its final ride” (turner kind of vibe). and this totally goes triple for the ultimate art that looks like the visible embodiment of the divine. if plato had been asked whether the zeus or athene of pheidias was just an imitation of an imitation, wouldn’t he have had to admit there was some extra cosmic sauce in them compared to any mortal form—and that the proportions they rocked were a level beyond any geometry or arithmetic (statesman flex).

next, plato dissed imitative art by saying it hypes up our emotions rather than our rational minds. he wasn’t buying aristotle’s theory that tragedy and other heavy imitations cleanse our passions through pity and fear; to him, they were just a chance to let those feels go wild. but hey, sometimes spilling your emotions can fix the chaos inside, and letting them breathe can actually pump up your inner strength. not every time you ride your feels is a sin—sometimes it’s a way to honor both your high and low vibes. deep or heavy thoughts that we can’t even verbalize might find their voice in a poet’s lines. everyone’s been there, getting lifted by stellar music, jaw-dropping architecture, or the calming embrace of nature. plato even admitted earlier in the republic that the arts could totally harmonize or even drain the mind, but in book 10 he’s peeping them through a stoic, puritan lens. all he asks is, “what straight-up good have they done?” and he isn’t vibing with the answer, “they gave people some innocent pleasure.”

he goes on to drop that he’s all for booting the poets because his deep analysis of the soul showed they’re all about the inferior vibes. in other words, the higher faculties roll with universals while the lower ones stick with the petty particulars of sense. poets might vibe with the moment, but they’re not on the same level as socrates and plato; he knew full well that homer and hesiod couldn’t serve as a legit rulebook for life if you actually interpreted ’em correctly—his ironic flex on them was basically a full-on diss on their authority. plus, he noticed that poets weren’t even doing any real critical analysis—as he drops in the apology, “anyone could interpret their writings better than they can themselves.” he actually checked out of poetry once he joined socrates’ squad, though, as he notes about solon, “he might’ve been one of the dopest if he hadn’t bailed for other hustles” (tim). so, from every angle, there’s a straight-up feud between plato and the poets—a throwback to the age-old clash between philosophy and poetry. in the protagoras, plato calls poets the sophists of their day, and his mad dislike for one crew spills over to the other. to him, they’re both the ultimate enemies of rational thought and deep abstraction, especially europides, whom he dissed over his sketchy vibes about tyrants and all that. after all, plato rolled into this world to school dudes—first on the fact that our senses and opinions are totally sus, and second on the reality of abstract ideas. and while it might seem off today to pit philosophy against poetry (since they share so many common vibes), that weirdness fades once you see poetry as the realm of raw sense and philosophy as all about thought and abstraction. too bad the word “idea,” which for plato dropped the realest truth, now gets tagged with subjectivity and a hint of unreality.

next, plato stacks up the diss on what’s seen versus what’s unseen—just like scripture, he flips the seen (the particulars) against the unseen (the universals and ideas). for him, all the little details are just floating around in a sensory world, laced with a hint of error or even evil. it’s obvious this is all just an illusion; a dude, a horse, a bed, and their whole class have the same level of error as any individual instance does—the truth you catch from one is just as solid as what’s transmitted through the medium of ideas. but plato, who was hella impressed by universals as the tools of deep thought, gives ‘em this essential truth that’s kinda imaginary and unreal—because sometimes universals come off sus and false while the particulars hold true. if he’d ever nailed down a clear vibe of the individual—like, the ultimate remix of universals and particulars—or if he could split opinion from straight-up sensation (since the ambiguous greek words totally mess with that), he wouldn’t have dissed the truth in sensory particulars.

moreover, the poets were seen as the ultimate reps of falsehood and fake vibes in every part of life and knowledge—just like the sophists and rhetoricians in gorgias and phaedrus. they were the bogus priests, fake prophets, lying spirits, and world enchanters. plato added another burn: these dudes were besties with tyrants, soaking up all the clout from despotic patronage. throughout history—from modern europe to ancient greece and rome—despotism has always rolled with a crew of bogus ideas and phony teachers. no legit government runs on muscle alone; without a little corruption of literature and morals, a sprinkling of mass imagination appeal, or a pretense of heaven’s favor (a dash of good powering the evil), tyranny can’t even hold in for a hot minute. the greek tyrants were no strangers to whipping up that pseudo-hellenic vibe; they even flexed their olympic wins and weren’t shy about their love for literature and art. initially, plato had his eyes on those greek poets strutting in the courts of dionysius or archelaus—the very sight of them selling out the tragic muse to hype up tyranny lit a fire under his old-school freedom spirit. but his prophetic gaze cut even deeper, calling out the false teachers of later ages who were just minions of their own governments. he bundled all the corruption of his time into one massive mess of evil—the rhetoricians, sophists, poets, and rulers who lie and run the world.

another beef from plato with poetry and imitative arts is that they’re made to hype up the emotions. now, modern peeps might wanna drop a distinction here that seems to’ve slipped by: emotions aren’t inherently bad or good, and you don’t really control ’em by trying to erase them—but by keeping them chill and in moderation. art’s whole mission is to serve up thought in the form of felt vibes, to pull those emotions to team reason, to inspire a burst of courage or even a moment of resignation, and maybe to drop a hint of infinity and eternity in a way plain words just can’t hit. sure, that same power that once, in the pure days of art, only flexed gods and heroes can now be used to drop the steamy image of a corinthian courtesan—but that just shows art, like any outward expression, can be twisted for good or bad, and it isn’t automatically linked with the high-tier parts of the soul over the low-tier. every piece of imitative art comes with its own limits—always a bit of a compromise. some of that pure ideal truth gets sacrificed for the sake of making the representation pop, and some of the precision in representation gets traded for the ideal. still, art’s always holding onto a permanent vibe; it traps that fleeting thought and stands as the bridge between raw sense and high-key ideas.

in our current mind state, poetry and all that fictional drip are totes regarded as lit. but yo, imagine an era when hardcore truth mode either yeets or totally remixes them. either way, we gotta admit they flex differently across history. back in humanity’s OG days, poetry (aside from those sage proverbs) was literally the entire vibe of literature and the only tool for brain flex; nowadays, it’s basically the ghost or echo of its old hype, barely hanging on. even milton was like, “real talk, epic poems might not even be a thing anymore.”

at the same time, we gotta peep that what plato would call the charms of poetry have lowkey shifted over to prose; he himself (in his statesman mode) admits that rhetoric is essentially the sidekick of politics, and he’s tryna swap in the legal drip (in his laws) as a stand-in for the old-school poets. among our crew, creative fire seems to be fading while cold, hard science is straight up dominating our feeds. the fake feels we call love have been the inspo behind modern poetry and romance, giving the world some human vibes—even if they don’t always level you up. but real talk, what if the spark that love gives to our imagination eventually runs on empty? modern english novels, which are the most binge-read forms around, are barely a century or two old—will love stories a hundred years from now, after thousands of reruns on the same theme, still hit different?

art ain’t on the same epic grid as philosophy or religion—and sometimes it even straight-up corrupts them. imagine a mindset where all artistic drip is seen as a fake, glitchy take on the religious or philosophical ideal. even the sickest visuals can be total cringe when you’re in the wrong mood, as shown by the fact that the mahometans and plenty of christian sects are like, “nah, we’re bailing on pics and images.” the birth of a major religion—be it christian or gentile—was never carved in wood or stone; it was all about that spirit flex deep in people’s hearts. early disciples caught mad vibes in big upper rooms or even dank earth caves; later, they upgraded to mosques, temples, churches, and monasteries. any major religious glow-up, just like its first drop, came from within, ghosting all the extra external rituals.

but yo, poetry and art can also drop truth bombs and pure feels. plato himself flip-flops between two extremes—like in book three, he’s all, “our youth should be raised on wholesome visuals,” and then in book ten, he lowkey ghosts the poets from his republic. while he admits that the arts, which some of us almost worship, might be slacking on their big mission, he also knows that completely banning imagination would be straight-up suicidal and impossible. after all, nature itself is a work of art—a quick breath of fresh air or one dope glance at a wild landscape can reboot that dimmed spark of poetry in the human heart. in the early levels of civilization, it’s imagination more than logic that makes us human versus animals; scrubbing art out means scrubbing out thought, language, and the purest truth. no religion is totally devoid of external vibes; even that mahometan who ditches pictures still got a temple to vibe with the most high, as stunning as any greek or christian build. feeling and thought aren’t beef—they’re ride-or-die partners, since you gotta feel before you can drop a dope move. and the deepest ideas, once they get real with you, always slide into pure feels.

plato ain’t tryna literally kick poets out of life and society. but he’s mad triggered by the unreal drip in their writings; he's basically protesting the degeneration of poetry in his day like we diss modern fiction for lacking serious purpose, shady excesses from some poets or novelists, preachy time-serving public writers, and that overall “whatever” truth vibe that, to a philosopher’s eye, is basically the norm. we got legit reasons to complain that our poets and novelists “paint inferior truth” and focus on the low-key depths of the soul, turning readers into stale remixes of what they consume. and we search in vain for that fresh, healthy vibe that plato was talking about—the beauty that hits your senses like a chill breeze and slowly draws your soul, even from early days, into harmony with the pure aesthetics of reason.

yo, there could be a form of poetry that’s basically the anthem of divine perfection—a harmony of goodness and truth among us humans—a vibe that resets the world’s youth and brings back those legendary days when the poet was your only teacher and ride-or-die homie. a poetry that digs up dope material from today as well as the nostalgic past, taming the unruly aspects of modern civilization with the flyest forms of speech and verse; one that pulls out the basic boss principles—or, as plato would call them, the essential forms—of truth and justice from the messy chaos of opinions and modern society; one that preserves all the epic from each generation and leaves the trash unsung; one that’s rooted not in weak daydreams, but in crystal-clear insight into human nature. then the saga of love could drop again in poetry or prose, a killer mashup united in the pursuit of knowledge and the service of god and man; and love would still fuel epic brainwaves and heroic moves like in the days of dante or petrarch; and a spectrum of manly and womanly beauty would rise above the everyday, with lives that aren’t just written like poems (laws) but actually lived. we’ve already peeped these killer vibes in the tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles—who plato quotes with straight-up approval, unlike his ironic nods to homer in the rep—in the bars of milton and wordsworth and other english poets, starting with the hebrew prophets and psalmists. shakespeare schooled us on how legends should speak and act; he sketched characters with mad purity and depth, elevating the human mind, but like homer (rep), he “left no way of life.” the next top poet of modern times, goethe, was down with “a lower degree of truth”; he painted the world as a stage where everyone’s just playing parts; he treated life as an art but didn’t drop any solid ideals of truth or action. a poet might rebel against any cap on his imagination and argue that moralizing in verse isn’t real poetry. maybe, like mephistopheles in faust, he would clap back at his haters. but a philosopher is still totally justified in asking, “how can the heavenly gift of poetry be dedicated to the good of mankind?”

bringing it back to plato, we peep that his argument is a wild remix of truth and cap. he’s fully aware of the absurdity of humans basing their whole lives on homer; just as in the phaedrus, he hints at how off it is to interpret mythology with cold, hard logic—both being the cringe trends of his own era that he roasted hard. on the flip side, his claim that if homer had taught anything truly dope, they wouldn’t let him hustle as a rhapsodist is both cap and against plato’s own vibe (rep). it’s kinda like those other paradoxes in the gorgias, like “no statesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city he led” and “no sophist ever got straight-up hustled by his pupils” (gorg).

the case for immortality basically chills on that hardcore dualism of soul and body. if we admit the soul exists, there’s no force out there that can yeet it into nonexistence. its own bad vibes, its vice, are like its own worst enemy; if that can’t take it down, nothing can. but plato also drops that the soul can get so clogged with earthly grime that it loses its original glow; and in the timaeus, he goes even harder than in the republic on how the body totally controls the mind—basically saying that our actions aren’t even truly our own, but just products of physical states (tim). in the republic, like everywhere else, he flip-flops between the idea of the original soul needing a full reset and the vibe you get from leveling up through training and education.

the vision of another realm gets pinned on er, son of armenius—who clement of alexandria even hints might be zoroaster. the story totally vibes with an oriental flavor and can be compared to those soul pilgrimages in the zend avesta (haug, avesta). but honestly, there’s zero proof in plato’s other drops of any handshake with zoroaster, so calling him er the pamphylian is kinda random. and don’t even get me started: heracleitus’s philosophy ain’t lookin’ like it was snatched from zoroaster, and the same goes for plato’s wild myths.

the layout of this vision is way less on point than in the phaedrus and phaedro. here, astronomy juggles with symbolism and myth; the vast heaven sphere is repped as a cylinder or box, flexing the seven orbits of the planets and fixed stars. this bad boy hangs from an axis or spindle that spins on necessity’s knee. the revolutions of those seven orbits are directed by the fates, and their perfectly synced moves drop what they call the “music of the spheres.” through the innermost—like the eighth member, the moon—the spindle passes; but we’re not 100% sure if this is just a continuation of that column of light the pilgrims peep, as plato hints they’re linked but not identical. also, the column itself is clearly not made of adamant, while the spindle (which is totally adamant) is locked to chains that hook into the heart of the light column—this column is said to hold up the heavens, but whether it just dangles from the spindle or chills at a right angle is left up in the air. the cylinder holding those star orbits is as symbolic as necessity spinning the spindle—the outer rim being the sphere of fixed stars, with zero deets on the gaps between their cosmic tracks. overall, the description is both a pic and an orrery, so it naturally ends up being a bit self-contradictory. also, the column of light isn’t the milky way—which isn’t straight or rainbow-like—but an imaginary earth axis, compared to a rainbow in color vibes (not form) and not like the undergirders of a trireme, but like the straight rope running from front to back where the supports meet.

the orrery, or star-map, in the republic is done up differently than the circles of the same and the other in the timaeus. in both texts, fixed stars get set apart from the planets, and they do their own orbit dance—even moving in reverse sometimes; in both works, everything spins around the world’s axis. but lowkey, we’re not 100% sure that in the republic they’re all spinning around the earth. the republic doesn’t drop any clear talk on the “circles of the same and other,” though in both the timaeus and the republic the fixed stars’ moves are supposed to match the universe’s spin. the thickness of the rims might be a way to flex the distances between planets. plato likely meant to show the earth—where er and his crew are checking out the cosmos—as staying put; but whether the earth itself spins, unless hinted at by the axis’s revolution, remains a total mystery (timaeus). viewers are meant to scope out the heavenly bodies from either above or below. the earth here is a mashup of heaven and earth in one, like in the phaedrus, where the spectator rides on its backside to peep the stars and get spun around. there’s no clear line between the equator and the ecliptic. but plato clearly imagines the planets moving opposite to the fixed stars, to explain their wild appearances in the skies. in his description of the meadow and the karma-style payback after death for good or bad vibes, you can spot some remix traces of homer.

the deets on the axis as a spindle and the idea that all the heavenly bodies form one unit come partly from trying to link cosmic motions with the myth of the fates weaving life’s web. the whole vibe of handing out lots, weaving them together, and making them irreversible—tied to the three fates, lachesis, clotho, and atropos—is straight-up derived from their very names. chance in human life is shown by how the lots are ordered. but no matter how hard chance might throw shade, a savvy human can totally overcome it if they choose right; honestly, the worst enemy isn’t chance at all—it’s yourself. even if you get the lowest lot in the draw, with smart moves you can still level up big time. and since plato ain’t about throwing down unproven claims, he backs this up with the example of odysseus, who, even picking last, managed to kill it. but just riding on virtue as a habit isn’t enough for solid choices; you gotta mix in wisdom if you’re gonna act right when new situations hit. routine good vibes are like, a low-tier kind of goodness; as coleridge said, “common sense is intolerable when it isn’t based on metaphysics,” and plato would be like, “habit’s trash if it isn’t rooted in philosophy.”

plato drops that free will is the ultimate flex to block out evil and vibe with the good. “virtue is free, and the more you honor it, the more you get,” he says. human life is kinda boxed in by necessity—stuff from before you’re even born affects you (pol). but even within these necessity walls, there’s some open space where you can be the boss, scope out how nature’s mix and fortune’s gifts hit your soul, and roll with it. not everyone gets first dibs on everything, but if we choose wisely and grind hard, the lot we get is chill enough.

the extra dose of realism in the epic thousand-year pilgrimage comes from deets like ardiaeus supposedly living a thousand years back; er coming back to life on day twelve after his so-called death, lining up perfectly with the seven days the pilgrims vibed in the meadow and the four-day trek to the column of light; the crazy precision of mentioning a soul that grabbed the twentieth lot; random notes that none of the souls had a fixed vibe, and when things went sideways, they dissed someone else instead of owning up; or that some souls chugged way too much of the waters of forgetfulness while er was blocked from drinking; odysseus wanting to finally crash—totally different from how dante and tennyson pictured him; and the whole lowkey mystery of how er got back into his body while other souls shot off like stars to their rebirth—all these touches add mad cred to the narrative. they’re the kind of natural, subtle details that defoe might've dropped to make his wild tales and ghost stories feel legit.

now, let’s spill the tea on some deets saved for the grand finale: (1) the republic’s total janus vibes, rockin’ two faces—one as a hellenic state and the other as a kingdom of philosophers. connected to that philosopher kingdom are (2) the wild paradoxes of the republic, as morgenstern calls ‘em: (a) communal property; (b) communal fams; (c) philosopher rule; (d) the analogy of the individual and the state—which, like some other rep comparisons, is taken way too far. next up, we dive into (3) education as plato sees it, blending the schooling of youth with after-life lessons into one mega curriculum; (4) we note some major differences between ancient and modern politics that the republic hints at; (5) we compare the politicus and the laws; (6) we peep the epic influence plato had on his copycats; and then (7) we consider the nature and value of political, and (8) of religious ideals.

1. plato straight-up says he’s about to drop an hellenic state (book v vibes). a ton of his rules are mad spartan—banning gold and silver, forcing squad meals, hardcore military training for the youth, and even gym routines for the women. sparta’s life was one giant camp (laws), enforced even harder in chill times than in war; spartan citizens, just like plato’s crew, weren’t allowed to trade—they were built to be soldiers, not store clerks. nowhere else in greece was a person so completely on lock with the state; when to marry, how to school the kids, what fits to rock, what grub to chow down on—everything was laid out by law. some of the dopest laws in the republic, like mad respect for parents and elders, and some of the harshest, like exposing deformed babies, were straight up borrowed from sparta. even the whole vibe of tight bonds between men and youths, or among men as a boost to bravery, is all spartan; in sparta, they even got the sexes closer than any other greek state, with property all shared up. and while there might’ve been less lowkey debauchery, marriage was taken way more lightly than elsewhere in greece. the “suprema lex” was all about keeping the fam intact and the state’s hustle on point. the raw muscle of a military government wasn’t exactly built for pure refinement; and the over-the-top strictness of some rules apparently sparked some major backlash. of all the hellenes, the spartans were the most open to bribery; some of the top spartan legends could be described, in plato’s words, as having a “fierce secret longing after gold and silver.” even if they weren’t communists in the strict sense, the whole communism vibe was maintained among them in how they split lands, shared meals, handled slaves, and used each other’s goods on the fly. marriage was a public institution—women got schooled by the state and even busted out public singing and dancing with the dudes.

yo, so sparta kept it 100 with some crazy old-school traditions—its bosses were hella strict about sticking to the OG vibe for music and poetry. like in plato’s republic, any new-fangled poet was straight-up yeeted out the scene. only dope jams allowed in the ideal state were those legit hymns to the gods, and sparta only let that kind slide. even though sparta wasn’t known for droppin’ sick poetic bars, they were still lowkey obsessed with poetry; they'd get all in their feels on tyrtaeus’s elegiac beats and would totally squad up around hippias just to vibe on homer recitations. but real talk—they were more like the timocratic crew than the absolute ideal state posse. and yo, their squad of elder peeps, aka the gerousia, had full flex to throw down opinions on all the nitty-gritty deets. plus, they were on a military lockdown when it came to dissing the dead or dropping arms at the temples; they kept enemy chases chill and only clapped back in defense mode, not to start random beef. no cap, these moves were totally lit and screamed spartan spirit.

yo, check it: in the early breakdown, the ideal state was basically a spartan remix, with the individual timocrat vibes straight up lifted from spartan citizens. the love for lacedaemon wasn’t just a thing for plato and xenophon— even your average athenians were shook by it. they peeped that sparta’s swagger had that missing magic their own democracy totally lacked. it wasn’t about the goodness of the laws but more the vibe of order and ride-or-die loyalty that was all over sparta. so hyped were they that athenians started rockin’ spartan fits and attitudes, earning themselves the nickname “the bruised-ear squad” (kinda like the roundheads of the commonwealth). that distant love for a totally different church or country—a craving for an imaginary, old-school simplicity that only looks perfect from afar, whether it’s a past that never existed or a future that’s pure fantasy—is a vibe we all get sometimes. and yo, plato’s republic totally rides that same wave.

but wait, there’s even more fire in plato’s republic: we’re talkin’ next-level literary and philosophical ed vibes, and a beauty-of-life aesthetic that flips spartan discipline on its head. plato wanted his crew to get a taste of athenian freedom while still channeling that lacedaemon discipline. his personal genius is all about that athenian flair, even though on paper he’s stan‐ing sparta; he’s basically a remix of both with a serious hellenic drip. the dude was all about humanizing the hellene beef—claiming the delphian god was the ultimate OG interpreter of all hellas. he was hyped for that harmony glow and dorian mode life, where the outer look is just a flex of the inner zen. heads up, though—he hadn’t yet dropped the ultimate truth bomb (that later pops off in the laws) that being a boss who vibes with everyone in unity totally beats training peeps just for war. and yo, in typical hellenic states, where democratic and aristocratic squads flex as the elite, the lower classes just fade into the background, showing up only as raw, untamed passions. plato wasn’t vibing with the idea of a state where every class is perfectly synced, or a world squad where different nations actually get a seat at the table. his city was built for epic war-mode rather than chill peace, which lowkey fits the everyday chaos of hellenic life. the myth of earth-born dudes? that was just the OG legit tradition of hellas, and the shout-out to the four ages of the world got major nods from hesiod and the poet squad. so, plato’s republic is like a mashup of that old-school greek polis ideal and the real-deal hellenic vibes of his day—a vision of a city straight out of the clouds.

and yo, there’s even another wild thread in the mix: plato’s republic isn’t just a dorian state, it’s also rocking a pythagorean league vibe. the whole “way of life” tied to pythagoras was next-level, kinda like those catholic monastic orders flexing some serious mind power, showing how one brain could boss up over the rest. naturally, that got plato thinking about reviving some of those medieval drip institutions. pythagoreans, just like plato, were all about strict life rules and hardcore moral and intellectual bootcamps. sure, the hype on music might sound extra to us now, but that was pure pythagorean flavor—not necessarily the actual tea on greek music’s influence. if there’s one government in hellas that was as woke as the pythagorean league of three hundred, it was that aristocracy of virtue. there was even a time when the philosophy of order—totally in greek style—rallied the top tier and bossed up public affairs for a good long while (like, until around b.c. 500). honestly, only states prepped by dorian institutions could’ve managed such a league. the rulers, much like plato’s own crew, had to survive a brutal training grind to pave way for educating the rest of the squad. even after that order dipped, legendary pythagoreans like archytas of tarentum still kept their political clout over the cities of magna graecia. all this was mad inspiring to plato, who was definitely deep-diving on the “way of life of pythagoras” and his followers. you can even peep subtle pythagorean vibes in the state’s mystical digits, in how the number splits the king and the tyrant, in the whole transmigration flex, in the music of the spheres ritual, and even in that extra though chill role math played in schooling.

but yo, just like his philosophy, plato’s state-level vision goes way beyond the old pythagorean crew. he’s tryna pull off the impossible—merging the ancient history of greek vibes with the future of philosophy—in a move kinda like christendom’s endless dream of mashing up europe’s old school drama with the kingdom of christ. real talk: nothing in our world even comes close to plato’s ideal state, and he’s straight-up honest about that; he never claimed such a state was even possible. he drops this truth bomb time and again—in the republic and later in the laws—basically saying that the perfect blend of communism and philosophy was never gonna work in his era, though it still stands as a dope blueprint. he’s arguing that ideals don’t lose their swag just because they can’t be 100% realized, even if they get met with a tidal wave of memes and laughs when he mentions them. when someone asks how the ultimate squad can ever form, he fires back with a cheeky, “when one son of a king becomes a philosopher,” and calls the whole myth of earth-born dudes a “noble lie.” and when the full blueprint is finally dropped, he keeps it 100 by confessing that his republic is just a mind-blowing vision—maybe it has some cosmic reality, but it ain’t the everyday mess of philosopher-king takeovers. some even say plato can fly as well as walk; nah, he’s literally doing both at once—soaring high while keeping his feet on solid ground, all in the same vibe.

now, niebuhr once popped a tiny question—was plato a good citizen? like, was he loyal to athenian institutions? honestly, he wasn’t exactly the democracy stan, but he wasn’t a ride-or-die for any current form of government either; he pretty much dissed them all, calling them “states of faction” (in the laws)—none hit that sweet spot of voluntary rule over willing peeps, which amiright kinda sounds like democracy, but the worst offender remains tyranny. truth is, this question barely matters when you’re talking about a legendary philosopher whose writings are meant for all time and all mankind, not just one squad or era. the fall of athenian politics was probably the spark that pushed plato to craft his ideal state, and the republic kind of reflects the fading epicness of hellas. you could totally roast st. augustine for his “city of god” for not being loyal to the roman empire, but even closer to home, the first christians get a pass—they were all about looking forward to that heavenly city while still playing by the rules of the higher powers.

2. so here’s the tea: the idea of the perfect state is loaded with paradoxes when judged by everyday human vibes. like, what one era finds paradoxical might be standard flex in the next, but plato’s paradoxes are still as wild to us as they were to his old-school crew. our modern world either scoffs at them as totally absurd or calls them unnatural and immoral, and folks got a kick out of how aristotle roasted them—like his own brand of common sense. the rich and cultured peeps have disliked and even dreaded these ideas, using the flop of trying to put them in practice as proof. yet, since these thoughts come from one of the ultimate brainiacs who leveled up both morality and religion, they deserve a more respect-worthy treatment from us. we might just have to speak to the public like plato drops mad bars in poetry, assuring everyone we’re not here to wreck current institutions. sometimes there are some heavy errors mixed with truth that deserve a deep dive—like, sometimes the half truth is way more lit than the whole story. and that “half” might actually be a major key in understanding human nature.

(a) first up, we’ve got the paradox of the community of goods—dropped super lowkey at the end of book three. as aristotle points out, it’s mostly just for the guardian squad, with the rest of the classes getting straight-up ghosted. but honestly, that omission isn’t a huge deal—it probably just comes from the overall game plan that stops the writer from getting lost in all the deets.

aristotle totally threw shade at the community of property, much like how modern political economy dissses anything that kills the hustle and crushes benevolence. modern writers practically skip over the topic ‘cause it’s supposedly been settled by common opinion ages ago. but remember: the whole sacred vibe around property is way more locked in now than it was back in the day—the world got older, so it got all conservative and stuff. way back, tribes or townships held land in common—that was probably the original property flex. ancient lawmakers invented all kinds of hacks to split and keep land divides clean; according to aristotle, some nations shared the land and divvied up the produce, while others kept land divided but pooled the goods. back then, the evils of debt and the inequality of property were way harsher than now, and land got wrecked by wars, revolutions, taxes, and other government drama. all this meant property wasn’t seen as super sacred. early christians even rocked the idea of holding property in common, with christ himself droppin’ that wisdom, and the move stuck as the ideal in almost every church era. and don’t even get me started on modern peeps who turned communism into a total religion—every time religious hype crept in, ideas like wycliffe’s “inheritance of grace” would totally be in vogue. a similar, even wilder spirit later exploded in politics—“the preparation of the gospel of peace” soon waved as the red flag of republican vibes.

we can’t really say how plato’s radical views would have hit his own crew—they’d probably’ve seen it as an over-the-top version of the spartan commonwealth. even modern scholars agree that the right to private property is all about practicality and can be tweaked in lots of ways for the public good. if some other way of owning property turns out to be more lit, it’d eventually get the same royal treatment; as plato put it, “the most useful is the most sacred.” old-school lawyers and church peeps used to hype property as if it were holy, but really they were just trying to slam down any major beef against individual or church rights.

so, when we kick around this question—without stressing about immediate real-world application—in the spirit of plato’s republic, are we really sure that our current property vibes are peak? is the usual wealth split in modern civs truly the best setup for educating and leveling up the masses? can “the spectator of all time and all existence” really be convinced that in a couple thousand years, we won’t see wild shifts in property rights—or even that the very idea of property, beyond just what you need to survive, might bounce out entirely? aristotle was onto this back then, even if we might laugh at it now. such a shift wouldn’t be bigger than the major flips that carried us from ancient to modern society—think russia freeing its serfs or america and the west indies shutting down slavery—and it’s even less dramatic than the gap between eastern village vibes and the western flex. pulling off such a revolution over just a few centuries would mean progress at a pace not much faster than what we’ve already seen in the last 50 or 60 years. like, japan flipped the script in 5 or 6 years while europe took 500-600 years to change. a bunch of once-hyped beliefs—once as sacred as property—have totally ghosted, and even the most absurd ideas about inheritance still got defended just as passionately as the chill ones. someone’s bound to ask if a society can ever be complete when the fate of thousands rides on one single individual’s vibe. and plenty will hope that our current scene is just a transit phase, paving the way for a higher era where property not only juices up the elite’s flex but also provides the ultimate cultural upgrade for everyone—and comes way more under public control. maybe one day that “have i not a right to do what i will with my own?” will look like a barbaric relic of old-school individualism, and owning just a slice might be a bigger blessing for everyone than the whole outdated pie.

all these deep reflections might seem totally visionary to a no-nonsense statesman, but to a true philosopher they’re all within reach. our deep dude can picture a far-off age or clime where the vibe of common property becomes as locked in for a people as private property is for us today. he gets that our current property game is only like 4 or 5 thousand years old—so why not let the end circle back to the beginning? even now, utopian ideas are already flexing on the law, and a wild abstract thought can seriously level up practical politics.

the usual claps against plato’s community of property ideas are the same tired arguments aristotle dropped—that sharing everything would kill the hustle and spark endless beef over who’s gonna do what. every dude might just produce the bare minimum and consume all he wants. history tells us that civilized nations have never really vibed with full-on socialism; it’s just too much effort for human nature since peeps always wanna flex their personal feels, even when trying to squad up. on the flip side, maybe our current property vibes are just old-school conventions—they vary wild from country to country and from one society’s state to another. we brag about a kind of “individualism” that isn’t real freedom at all but more like a manufactured result of modern european industrial life. sure, we’re technically free, but we’re also straight-up chained down by economic necessities. even if we can’t expect everyone to just chill about it, look how organized the masses have gotten in the last 50 years—a power nobody would've even dreamed of half a century ago. the same forces that flipped europe’s political system might just pull off a similar revolution in social and industrial realms worldwide. and if we assume that some genuinely good, plus even just neutral, vibes are working in the community, there’s nothing absurd about thinking that once the masses level up, see how much more is possible than just a few hoarding the loot, and start chasing that common win with a grind and brainpower the world’s never seen before.



now that the whole world finally hit start and ain't stuck under the old-school tyranny of boring customs and clueless vibes; now that savage critique has sliced through the dusty veil of tradition and the past can’t flex over the present anymore—civilization’s glow-up is gonna be mad quick and off the charts, no cap. even at our current fire speed, the level-up we hit in two or three gens is so wild it's beyond even our squad’s wildest imagination.

there are forces in the universe grinding not in a basic, one-plus-one equals two vibe but in that mad exponential, geometry-level ratio of increase. education, as plato would say, spins like a hype wheel on turbo mode, multiplying faster than a trending meme. and we straight up can’t even predict how massive its flex will be once it goes universal—when it’s passed down through endless generations—when it’s finally yeeted from the chains of dumb superstition and perfectly tuned to the needs and skills of all kinds of dudes and dudettes. likewise, the team-up of brains and hustle, whether on the job or hitting the books, could drop some next-level achievements. the natural science squad isn’t even half-developed yet; the earth’s soil could totally level up to become way more fertile instead of ghosting on us, and tech and machinery are about to hit game-changing upgrades—from mega power to micro precision. new hacks on physiology might drop, digging deep into the inner code of human nature. our health vibes could hit legendary status and peeps might live longer thanks to dope sanitary and medical breakthroughs. think epic peace, endless chill time, and a variety of innocent refreshers to boot. the wild ride of locomotion might soon connect the farthest corners of the planet, and our minds could start doing mysterious, next-level moves that only drop during epic historical crises. the east and the west might totally link up, with every nation dropping their hottest takes and experience into humanity’s common meme feed. loads of other factors get tossed into this mental moshpit, but lowkey, it’s probably better to wrap it up since most peeps think this stuff is either extra or just plain vanilla to the lab rats.

(b) neither plato nor aristotle got major shook by the idea of sharing property—this wasn’t as sus or as massive a betrayal of classic hellenic vibes as sharing wives and kids, no cap. he kicks off this wild theory by pitching that bros and dudettes should hold the same gigs, getting hook-ups with the same training and edu to level the playing field. if male and female animals both chase the same vibes, then why shouldn’t human dudes and dudettes squad up on the same goals?

but yo, didn’t we just drop the bomb that different natures should roll on different pursuits? so how can men and women ride the exact same wave? isn’t that clashing with our old-school division of labor game? these objections get yeeted the moment they pop up because, according to plato, there’s literally no organic diff between men and women—just that dudes make and girls carry, which is totally accidental. riding with the animal analogy, he claims nature drops all kinds of boss perks randomly on both genders, even if the boys sometimes get a mini extra buff. and if some folks are all like “ew, sharing the same gym sesh is cringe,” plato’s like, “nah, that’s just what we’re used to,” so chill your vibes.

plato straight-up yeeted local, outdated ideas and the eastern examples—total flex of independent brain power. he peeps that womxn make up half of humanity, sometimes even the more essential half (laws), and for the sake of both dudes and dudettes he wants womxn to level up to a higher existence. instead of getting all mushy with sentiment, he drops philosophy on a question that’s always been shoved into the realm of customs or feels, both in ancient times and now. the greeks used to vibe with epic ideals of womxn through bomb goddesses like athene and artemis and legends like antigone and andromache, but those ideals never came through in real life. athenian womxn were never on the same tier as their husbands—they weren’t out here hosting epic parties or ruling the crib, they were just on housekeeping and kid duty. they didn’t jump into military or political battles, and even in later greek times, no womxn ever broke out as a literature superstar. history’s tea was that “hers is the greatest glory who has the least renown among men,” which was their lowkey way of celebrating feminine excellence. but plato flipped the script completely, showing a next-level ideal where womxn are meant to be true ride-or-die partners—sharing the grind in war and managing the state alongside their dudes. they get the same full-body and mind training, shedding as much of that maternity baggage and “female-only” drip as possible.

the modern haters of gender equality would clap back saying that the diff between men and womxn isn’t just that one tiny thing plato noted; they’d argue that sensitivity, grace, and gentleness are classic femme traits while raw energy, strength, and high-level smarts are the manly package. and honestly, that roast is on point—these differences run deep and aren’t just a one-and-done deal. but still, we can’t even tell how much of those diff are schooled into us by society or are hardcore inherited from our old-gen habits.

womxn have always been fed the tea—not that they were outright slaves, but that they were meant to chill in an inferior squad, supposedly swapping weakness for some “compensating” perks; and they pretty much rolled with it, unfortunately. plus, our bodies can totally flex or fade over time based on our lifestyles—what was once just a rumor of weakness can become a straight-up fact. sexual traits bounce all over the place across different countries, social ranks, and even shift in the same peeps as they level up. so maybe plato was onto something when he claimed that there’s no ultimate diff between the sexes apart from the basic animal level, because all those extras might just vanish in a different societal patch or with new training.

after riding that first wave, now we dive into round two—the communal squad for wives and kids. “is that even possible? is it even a vibe?” like glaucon hints, and we’re shouting even louder, “big doubts on both counts, fam.” any freewheeling chat on this topic? nah, it’s way too deep and maybe peeps are smart enough not to under-scope the core pillars of social life. hardly any of us can safely deep-dive into what nature’s locking away, kinda like we shouldn’t be hacking apart our own bodies.

but fr, we gotta respect the way plato rolled out his conclusions. as mr. grote already put it, it’s absolutely wild that one of the wisest homies ever could drop moral vibes that are totally off the grid from our norm. and if we wanna do plato justice, we need to break down his proposals. first, his take on gender ties is like the flip side of being excessively free—he’s aiming for an impossible strictness. second, he sees the fam as the natural enemy of the state, holding onto this serious hope that a universal brotherhood might replace all those personal, messy interests—an idea that, though not backed by real-life flexes, lit up the minds of many noble peeps. on the flip side, there’s zero deep feels or creative juice in the bonds between men and womxn according to him; humans revert to straight-up animal mode, neither reaching for celestial heights nor suppressing their natural instincts. basically, all that artsy, lovey-dovey poetry we see in modern rom-coms would be totally banned under plato’s rules.

in plato’s republic, the marriage game is all about one mega goal—the total upgrade of the human race. across generations, a seriously epic development of both body and mind could drop. the animal analogy drops the hint that humans can, within set limits, totally remix their nature. and just like in the wild where the best are picked for breeding and the rest get yeeted, there’d be a selection process to decide whose lives are legit enough to be preserved.

we’re honestly shook by this platonic dream, because first off, those higher, lit human feels are way too epic to be snuffed out; and secondly, even if we rolled out his plan, the glow-up in our gene pool wouldn’t compensate for losing all the dope essentials of life. the ultimate love and care for even the most low-key, overlooked humans—the infants, the misfits, the mentally off, the complete noobs—really stands as one of christianity’s sickest wins. we’ve slowly learned, even if it’s not perfect yet, that every single individual is priceless in god’s eyes, and that when we honor even the most rough-and-tumble version of his image, we’re basically sending major respect his way (laws). this is the tea christ dropped in his parable when he said, “their angels always catch a glimpse of my father’s face up in heaven.” these teachings only pop off sometimes across the ages; they were totally alien in plato’s time and hit distinctly different vibes in various parts of the christian world. for the greek squad, the fam was just a ritual institution—binding peeps with a tie that was less intense than best friend vibes and way less epic and sacred than the bond of a nation. plato thought he was leveling these low-key customs up to a higher plane of nature and reason, but from our modern and christian POV, it’s like he’s literally endorsing chaos—straight-up murdering the original moral vibe.

the major fail in these and similar mind-blasts is that they totally ghost the diff between humans and animals. humans get looked at like a pet collection or, worst-case, like property for a slave-owner; all that higher, human sauce gets left on read. animal breeders only care about size, speed, and strength (maybe a bit of courage or chill), mostly to turn them into edible snacks. but we weren’t bred to be dinner or just to flex in brawls or races or as cart-pullers. improving the human race ain’t just about bulking up bones and flesh—it’s about growing our mind and leveling up our enlightenment.

so there’s gotta be a hookup where not just bodies but genuine, deep minds mate—mixing imagination and reason along with that raw physical spark. dudes and dudettes without feelings or creative fire are basically animals; yet plato yeets those major qualities and leaves a total void, not even packing the noble desire for epic offspring, since parents aren’t even allowed to know their own kids. this turns the most crucial social connection into something brutally transactional. couples only link up for that one big wedding bash; their kids aren’t theirs—they belong to the squad, the state; and there’s zero love or warm fuzzies connecting them. if only his own animal analogy had been on point, it might have saved him from this colossal misfire—‘cause even the noblest birds and beasts are all about feeding, protecting, and staying loyal to their young.

a top physiologist wants to try and place life on a strict physical basis. but seriously, shouldn’t life rest on some heavy moral vibes rather than just physical stats? the higher, human, rational part comes first, then the animal bits follow. they aren’t split in stone; on off-days like sickness or binge mode, both vibes mix together as different aspects of our shared human nature. and the moral isn’t just a cap on the physical—it’s like an upgrade, the peak form that physical nature can achieve. as plato would say, the body don’t look after itself or the mind, but the mind’s the real boss that handles both.

in every human move, it ain’t what we share with animals that sets us apart—it’s that extra sauce that makes us uniquely human. even if we break everything down to physical health (like our blood flow, as the french would spit, “la facon que notre sang circule”), on purely physical grounds we’re always forced to circle back to ideas. mind, reason, duty, and conscience—no matter what name you throw at them—keep reappearing. you just can’t have a lit body without a lit mind, and a lit mind without a solid sense of duty and a mad love for truth (charm).

it’s pretty wild that one of the all-time greatest ancient philosophers ended up splitting body and mind in his marriage rules—like, total head-scratcher. but the real kicker isn’t that plato’s moral ideas seem super revolting to us now, it’s that he flipped the script so hard he tumbled from the dreamy heights of idealism straight into the crudest beast mode. riding high on this new gift of reflection, he apparently tried to deep dive into a topic that deserved the chill, enlightened vibes of his own age—but the general mood of hellas was like, “nah fam, that monstrous fantasy ain’t it.” the ancient poets and later tragedians were all about showing mad respect for family, which was like the sacred pillar of their religious drip. but the spartan model, and maybe his own desire to flex against public opinion, totally misled him. plato wanted to merge every fam from the state into one mega squad, picking only the finest specimens of men and womxn to breed that super elite crew.

but yo, since that animal side of us always makes a comeback—sometimes lurking behind philosophy or poetry—and because any deviation from established morals, even if accidental, is bound to shake things up, it’s worth dropping a bit more tea on the major objections to plato’s marriage remix. first off, history shows that wherever polygamy reigned, the whole race went downhill. one man to one woman is the law of god and nature, no cap. almost every advanced society before the written word went monogamous; once you take that step, there’s no turning back. the rare exceptions among brahmins, maho metans, or ancient persians just serve to prove the rule even harder.

mixing superior and inferior races almost never produces lit offspring because things get wild and messy; the kids usually end up dissing the mom and get ghosted by a dad who’s straight-up ashamed. barbaric nations, once hit with european vice, end up dying out; polygamist crews either start importing kids from other lands or just dwindle in numbers—or both. dynasties and aristos that dissed nature’s laws have crashed in size and status, and arranged marriages (mariages de convenance) leave a weak AF mark on their offspring (think king lear vibes). marrying close kin or the same fam time and again usually breeds weak or brain-dead kids, sometimes turning into wild, unfiltered behavior as they grow up. even common hookers hardly drop any offspring. with all this unmistakable tea, the authority of morality in gender relations stands super strong—way more factors are in this “mystery” than plato and other philosophers even dreamed of.

recent deep dives have shown that among primitive tribes there was a squad-style community of wives as if they were property, and that the only wife or slave a dude could call his own was the one snagged by spear, no cap. the partial existence of these customs among some lower-tier humans, and the survival of quirky marriage ceremonies in some cultured nations, are seen as proof that these institutions might've once been universal. no cap, anthropology has flipped our views on when and how humans first dropped onto the scene. we’ve got way more deets on the world’s aborigines than ever before, but every new fact just shows how little we really know. even with all those ancient writings, we’re still barely scratching the surface of what humans were like 2000 or 3000 years ago. and when you think about what our ancestors were like 200,000 or 300,000 years back—when most peeps were hella basic and closer to animals than any group today—we can’t even start guessing. plato (laws) and aristotle (metaphysics) might have been more on point than we think by suggesting that civilization gets discovered and lost over and over again. if we can’t even argue that all barbarism is just a downgraded form of civilization, then we can’t really set any limits on how deep humans can sink from war, disease, or isolation. and if we’re gonna pull insights about the origin of marriage from barbaric practices, we must also peep the far-out animal analogies. lots of birds and animals, especially the carnivores, lock in with just one mate, and their natural love and care for their young totally clashes with that old-school, primitive theory of marriage. if we crash back to a time when humans were almost animals and just basic companions, we’ve got every right to jump from animal life to human life, just like we compare raw barbarism to super civilized vibes. the record of animal life on this planet is mad patchy—the connecting links are missing and can’t be filled in; and the record of social life? Even more fragmented and shaky, fr. even if we admit our OG ancestors had zero marriage institutions as we know them, the steps they took from raw barbarism to the civilizations of china, assyria, greece, or even ancient germans are still totally unknown.

yo, these wild speculations are hella unsettling, like they’re lowkey spilling the tea that an institution we thought was a straight-up divine drop is really just the remix of history and vibes. we asked, “yo, where’d marriage even pop off from?” and they hit us with that, much like property rights, after a bajillion wars and savage contests, it just slowly arose from the selfish hustle of barbarians. we're staring right in the face at human nature in its raw, unfiltered mode. we’re forced to take the low-key, basic version of how human society kicked off instead of a glowing, next-level tale. but on the flip, we can also say that every glow-up in human progress followed the same drip, with marriage and fam getting more defined and made sacred as the ages rolled on. the civilized east is on another level compared to those savage tribes; the greeks and romans even leveled up that east vibe, and christian nations got mad strict on marriage more than any ancient squad. like, instead of fronting with major regrets about the past, we should be hyped and looking forward with some serious hope for the future. we gotta consecrate what we believe is hella holy, ‘cause the holiest stuff is naturally the most useful. it’s way more legit to keep the sacred marriage tie when you can see the gains than when you’re just shook by a vague religious horror for breaking it. but yo, in all those crazy transition times when old-school beliefs are getting clapped by new ones, there’s a risk that we might accidentally yeet our moral compass, using passion’s hype as an excuse in a fog of uncertain facts and trending opinions. and these days, a ton of peeps—woke from their anthropology flexes and tripping over anything new and wild, some speaking in fear and others in hope—are betting that one day, with women bossing up, kids flexing their rebellious energy, deep dives into human relations, or just the raw force of the outside world, the tight bonds of family life might either get totally yeeted or just chill on the edge.

yo, when these so-called “social reformers” drop doubts about how the sexes vibe and what makes a human morally solid, there’s a legit comeback if you need one. here’s the tea: they’re chatting about man as if he’s just the fantasy they wanna construct, but we’re talking about him as he actually is. they isolate his animal side; we see him as a multi-dimensional meme—flipping between good and bad, always trying to level up and become “just a little lower than the angels.” sure, in classic platonic style, we ain’t blind to the beefs and drama of fam life, the shady biz in trade, the clout-flattery between social classes, or how fam drama can block you from those epic high-level goals. but we’re also woke to even bigger lurking evils that stay hidden or get suppressed. imagine a world where human passions run wild, untamed by any divine or human authority, with zero shame or decency, no higher vibes to sanctify raw instincts—just some barebones rule of fitness. so, is that seriously the reason we gotta yeet away the civilization that’s taken ages to build?

yo, strength and health ain’t the only flexes we need; mental drip, character vibes, and that soul sauce are way more important. we know how human nature can get totally wrecked, but no one’s got a hack to upgrade our breed through artificial means, ya feel? this whole sitch is hella complex: rewind just four steps (which honestly makes up a child’s entire vibe) and suddenly you’re staring at like thirty OG ancestors in the mix. wild tales get dropped all the time about how diseases or quirks get passed down from some old-school ancestor. sure, we can trace how kiddos physically flex their parents’ features—‘sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat’ and all that jazz—but almost as often, they flip the script and come in with differences that set them apart from both their folks and each other. we even hear of those mental quirks that run deep in fams, and of that natural pull, like in animals, to bounce back to an OG stock. but here’s the kicker: it’s mad hard to tell what’s a true inheritage of genius or dope qualities and what’s just a copycat vibe or the result of similar drama. most epic legends—those great men and women—rarely came from legendary parent squads. nothing in their birth receipts or family story explains their glow-up. like, in the last couple of centuries, hardly any english poets even kept it in the fam—the legacy just ghosted. nature’s kept her receipts so deep, and it’s extra how some peeps think that, with the perfect marriage hacks or, as plato would say, “by an ingenious system of lots,” we could churn out the next shakespeare or milton. even if we could breed dudes with bulldog tenacity, or, like the spartans, who were too thick to dip during battle, would it really level up the world? a ton of the dopest humans have been lowkey physically weak. tyrtaeus, aesop, or even our boy newton might’ve been benched in sparta; and some of the most gorgeous and strong peeps have turned out to be the wickedest and worst. not by plato’s move of pairing the strong and fine regardless of feels, nor by his other tactic of mixing mismatched natures (statesman), have we vibed our way out from the raw brutality and wild free-for-all of primitive marriage to that christian, high-key civilized version.

few would front that we get dropped into this world with an inheritance of mental and physical drip straight from our parents, or even further back from OG ancestors, then from our squad, and finally from the overall vibe of mankind we’re born into. it’s practically universal to hear, “so-and-so is just like his dad or his uncle,” and old peeps often notice a kid rocking features reminiscent of a long-lost ancestor, saying that “nature sometimes skips a generation.” and yo, if we really had the lowdown on our ancestors, those similarities would hit us even harder. even if we admit these fam recaps in a casual way, there’s no clear-cut method to measure them—they only make up a tiny piece of what each person is. the whole heredity thing might seem like it’s stealing the remote control of our lives, but it’s the notion, not the actual receipts, that really freak us out. what we got from our oldies is just a snippet of our full potential. knowing that your fam’s been on the booze or crazy train might be the best alert to stop that vibe from blowing up in the next gen. a parent’s usually the first to peep the vices or health issues in their kid that they also feel in themselves. life can then be totally reoriented to prevent or cure that drama. maybe the traces of that nasty consumption vibe get so muted you can barely see ‘em, or vanish altogether; maybe that deep-seated pull toward vice or crime even gets canceled. so, heredity—with all its baggage—could flip from a curse to a blessing. we gotta admit, in both our birth vibes and our overall makeup, there are pre-set circumstances that shape us, but even so, within that wall of inevitability, we still got the power to remix our lives using the sheer force of human will.

yo, check it—there’s another twist in the marriage game that plato never really vibed with. in his ideal state, all the kiddos are foundlings. he never even clocked that, by universal stats, most of these little ones would’ve dipped if left on their own. because, real talk, kids can only really thrive in a fam setting. there’s this subtle, deep empathy between a mom and her kid that no other squad of moms or even “strong nurses (one or more)” (as the laws put it) can replicate. if plato’s “pen” had been as lethal as the creches in paris or the foundling hospital in dublin, more than nine-tenths of his mini-mes would’ve straight-up peaced out. there’d be zero need to expose or shuffle the weaker kiddos—they’d just ghost on their own. nature is, like, screaming on a whole other level against wrecking the fam.

yo, so what plato peeped about sparta got totally misapplied to his dream commonwealth. he probably noticed that both spartan dudes and dudettes were flexing way above the other greeks in terms of form and strength, and he was all like, “that’s gotta be the glow-up from their marriage laws and customs.” but he totally missed that spartan peeps were also all about that noble offspring life, and that their physical superiority wasn’t just because of how they did marriage, but more on account of their hardcore temperance and rigorous training. he didn’t even think that sparta was dope not because they were slack on morality, but because they were rocking a political principle so lit, it outclassed any other grecian state. and yo, he straight-up overlooked the fact that sparta wasn’t exactly cranking out the absolute finest of greeks. the genius, the political fire of athens, the love for liberty—everything that made greece eternally lit—was totally missing from the spartan menu. they had no themistocles, pericles, aeschylus, sophocles, socrates, or even plato himself. in sparta, the individual was always benched in favor of the state; the laws were locked in and not up for remix. but seriously, how do cities and nations get that next-level glow if not powered by those legendary, unpredictable individual sparks that show up outta nowhere? modern peeps might go off on the value of individuality, but we can’t just harshly diss a system that, instead of encouraging those scattered seeds of genius and character, tends to straight-up smother ‘em.

yo, even while throwing some major shade at plato, we gotta admit that neither christianity nor any other religion or society has yet managed to nail down this mega difficult social puzzle, and that plato’s angle is exactly the one we tend to ghost. population is the wildest, untameable force in the political and social game. look at big cities—ever notice how the biggest speed bump to leveling up the lives of the less fortunate is their absolute mess with marriage? it might seem like a tiny flaw when you’re not thinking of the endless ripple effects. and then you got whole countries, like india or even ireland these days, where fixing the marriage game is basically the secret sauce for community happiness. too many peeps in one zone, or marrying hella early and then dropping weak, half-baked kiddos; or living in conditions that leave them totally drained and only able to pass on that same vibe—who’s got a flex against the raw power of human passion, especially when custom and religion have given it full approval? beyond just schooling and education, we gotta be on the lookout for some fresh rules of what’s dope and what’s trash in these matters, some loud stance of opinion that might be lowkey whisperin’ right now but hasn’t yet blown up everyone’s moral radar. we always end up losing sight of what’s useful, right when we need it most. the influences we can drop on this topic are mostly indirect. maybe in a couple of generations, with hyped education, peeps bouncing to new lands, and major upgrades in agriculture and manufacturing, the whole mess will get solved. meanwhile, the state doctor is always too scared to really deep-dive into the wound—it’s above his skill, a mess he can’t let be, but also can’t safely touch:

“we just cover up and slap a bandage on the rot.”

yo, and then back in our own private worlds, when we see a fam one by one be dropped off by some inherited malady, and sometimes the parents survive the wreck, do our brains ever slam back to that lit day 25 or 30 years ago when, under the best vibes and amid epic celebrations with friends and squad, a bride and a groom linked up for life? when we vibe on that memory, we’re not throwing physical facts against morals—we’re just tryna blast the sound of reason to drag us away from over-the-top emotional sentimentality crashing into common sense. like, the late dr. combe is said to have dodged the marriage hype ‘cause he knew his fam was cursed with hereditary consumption. and this one dude, legit a genius and a squad leader in my youth, used to rock a black ribbon on his wrist as a constant reminder that, being prone to bouts of insanity, he needed to keep his natural lovey-feely impulses in check—he ended up dying solo in a lunatic asylum. these two mini stories drop some serious reflection: only a few peeps have handled their duty right, while most of humanity should’ve peeped the disaster they were about to drop on the world. if we could block off such marriages without straight-up violating feelings or proper vibes, then bet, we totally should; and over time, that ban would be backed by some hardcore natural horror, just like the ancient taboo that stopped close-blood marriages. humanity would be way happier if certain things allowed now had been off the table from the jump; if religion’s muscle could have vetoed health-hurt practices; if back in the day, sanitary principles had that superstitious awe factor. but yo, since we’re so far deep into history now, we can’t just slap a fresh religious ban on things instantly. a true free agent can’t have his fancies dictated by law; plus, enforcing that law would be a total mess, ‘cause it’s next to impossible to nail down exactly when marriage should be forbidden. who can even weigh virtue or luck against health, or moral mojo against body might? who can stack probabilities against straight-up certainties? there’s been both ups and downs in the grind of suffering; and sometimes, diseases like consumption have even refined and softened someone’s character. youth is just too green to balance these delicate vibes; parents usually don’t clock them until it’s almost too late. sometimes the issues are distant enough to be dodged—a change of scenery, a whole new life vibe, or just strong home feels might cancel them out. so peeps are often just overthinking when their minds are already set and their futures are totally locked together. and honestly, there’s no solid proof that marriages get majorly influenced by these brainy reflections, which just can’t hold up against that unstoppable pull of personal attachment.

lastly, nobody who’s peeped the first massive flood of raw passion in youth—the crazy, unfiltered surge of feels that’s mad hard to control—can watch it ripple through the mind and soul without feeling that our way of handling it is, like, totally sus. that the most important vibe in human life is just left to random chance or wrapped up in mystery, and instead of getting really disciplined or understood, is forced to stick to some lame external code of propriety, can’t be seen by a philosopher as a safe or dope state of affairs. yet, those in charge of the young squad might still find a way through vigilant watchfulness, real affection, that raw blend of manliness and innocence in their own lives, tossing out occasional hints and general advice that anyone can vibe with to ease this nasty bug that slowly eats away at individuals and messes up the moral firmware of whole nations. in any duty to others, there’s no cap on how much secrecy and self-restraint you need. the danger is real that someone doling out advice might spill the tea too early, letting another get way too much control; or that by demanding someone confess their shady deeds, they just cement a passing impression of evil.

and yo, plato ain’t totally off when he says that tight fam bonds can mess with higher aims. if some peeps have been so lit on the party scene that they’ve dropped what was meant for the good of humanity, then for sure there’s also those who sacrificed what was supposed to lift up mankind or even their country because they were too caught up in fam duty. the weight of kids, the hustle to secure bank for fam support, rich peeps throwing clout love at the poor, the exclusivity of caste, flexing about one’s birth or wealth, and the way fam life can drag you away from chasing those ideal or heroic dreams are all as much of a downer now as they were back in plato’s day. and if we choose to vibe on the softer side of home—growing genuine feels, soaking in the perks of society, and that unwavering fam loyalty aimed at the good of the crew—we ain’t really tryna diss plato; maybe we should even be grateful he showed us the flip side. not trying to defend him on a moral highground here, but we gotta give props that there’s a slice of the world that naturally led him to that error.

yo, we barely even vibe with the power that the idea of the state—and all those abstract concepts—had over plato’s brain. to us, the state seems like it’s built from the fam, or even the stage where all fam and social life go down. but for plato, in his mood of the day, the fam was just a major distraction that messed up the high-key unity of the state instead of filling it up. he was all about that one-thing-only organization—a political machine that, if you flip it, is basically a military squad. the state was supposed to have everything a human needs, and just like how the church later became this mega magnet for all desires and vibes, it was meant to absorb every other little want and affection. in war, a thousand citizens are meant to stack up like an unbreakable wall against the world or a persian horde; in peace, prepping for war and their duties to the state—which are also duties to one another—completely own their lives. the only other flex allowed, aside from constant war mode, is the love of philosophy. when they’re too old to hit the battlefield, they bounce from active life and dive into a second round of hardcore study and chill contemplation. there’s even a monastic vibe hiding in plato’s communism. if he could have done without the whole kid drama, he might’ve flipped his republic into a full-blown religious order. and even in the laws, when common sense finally comes knocking, he doesn’t backtrack on his error. in the state he’d found, there’s literally no marrying or setting up unions—except that, because humans are a bit of a hot mess, he concedes to let nature’s law run the show.

(c) yo, plato's got an equally wild—or in his own flex even more savage—paradox up his sleeve, summed up in that iconic line, "until kings are philosophers or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill." in his drip, by "philosophers" he means those chill homies who can catch major ideas, especially that dope idea of good. so the second-level edu, that higher knowledge grind, is all about unlocking that ultimate life hack. after they've already been shaped into lit citizens, they're now prepped to become boss legislators. and yo, it's wild—just like aristotle once described how plato's lecture peeps came expecting epic moral truths but got hit with arithmetic and math formulas instead—that plato isn’t about teaching finance, law, or military hacks; nah, his future law squad only gets abstract math as a warm-up for that even more abstract good vibe. as aristotle once wondered, what’s the point of a dude catching the idea of good if he’s clueless about what’s actually epic for the individual, the squad, or society as a whole? it’s a major head-scratcher how plato’s chosen his guardians to run state biz solely through the five mathematical sciences. we’ve been hunting through his own scrolls for a clear tea drop on this cray absurdity, but nada, fam.

yo, discovering a massive metaphysical concept totally scrambles the mind into a prophetic state where you lose all grip on figuring its true clout. no meta explorer ever dissed his own deep dives—he’s convinced his speculations are untouchable—and he totally misses that what he thought was absolute truth might bounce back in the next wave as some form of logic or thought tool. later generations sometimes straight-up misread the real value of his deep flexes, thinking they added zilch to the human knowledge bank. the idea of good gets brushed off by modern brainiacs as just a lame abstraction, but they forget that this idea is chillin’, waiting to be boosted by future knowledge updates. back when humanity didn’t even know that the universe rolls with a law, just dropping the concept of law, design, or that ultimate vibe—and hinting at the far-off harmony of knowledge—was a huge glow-up. even the basic shout-out that all things are one makes peeps see the world with brand-new eyeballs, totally shifting their take on life, politics, and even their own character. just imagine a legend like pericles catching high vibes from vibing with anaxagoras! chasing that unreachable next-level idea is way cooler than just chilling in a narrow fact zone. and honestly, those early epic science ideas often end up ghosted later on. how rare is it that any modern thinker can be hailed in plato’s grand lingo as "he is the spectator of all time and all existence!"

and yo, it's totally not sus to slap these massive metaphysical vibes onto real-life and political game on the fly. in that first hype of ideas, peeps tend to spot them everywhere and flex them in every corner—even the most random spots. they miss that it takes ages of experience to fill in "the intermediate axioms." plato himself seemed to think that truths about psychology, like those in astronomy and harmonics, would drop through hardcore deduction, and that his own method in book four—inferring truths from experience and language—was just a rough draft, only provisional. so when, after nailing the idea of good (the ultimate endgame of dialectic), someone asks him, "what’s the nature and breakdown of this science?" he straight-up ghosts the answer, like hinting the current knowledge just isn’t deep enough for his final chill. the OG sciences gotta be repped first, and trust, they’ll be studied till the end of time—even if in a vibe totally different from what plato imagined. still, even though he's lowkey aware his ideal is kinda empty, he’s mad hyped just thinking about it. staring into that cosmic glow orb, he might see nothing, but his soul still gets lifted. like, a hebrew prophet was all about how flexing faith in god would level up his world control, while a greek thinker believed that deep contemplation of good would turn someone into a legendary legislator. both cases need that filling in to hit divine perfection—whether in a personal or straight-up cosmic way that exists outside and inside us, no cap.

no mention of that dope idea of good drops in timaeus, and the divine creator is totally MIA in the republic; so naturally, we're like, how do these two epic vibes even clink? is god posted above or below the idea of good? or is the idea of good just another angle on god? real talk: that latter vibe is the legit answer. for the greek philosopher, god’s perfection and unity was a next-level flex way beyond his mere personality—which he barely had the words for and would’ve seemed like some myth remix. but for the christian crew or modern brain squad, it’s hella tough (if not impossible) to peg something they call "mere abstraction" as real; meanwhile, for plato, that abstraction is the most lit, the truest thing ever. so from these diff mindsets, plato seems to be riding his own brainwave. but if we flip the idea of good as "an intelligent principle of law and order in the universe, rep’ing man and nature equally," then boom—we find a solid meet-up point between his vibe and ours.

yo, the age-old debate on whether a ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is still straight-up trending. across europe and asia, there’s been that one legend who mashed up boss-level command with deep thought, even though there’s also been a bunch of bogus mash-ups. some kinda speculative flex is needed in both practical life and political game; like the smooth-talker in the phaedrus, peeps need to catch the full spectrum of human vibes and elevate themselves above daily basic life. still, the whole philosopher-statesman idea has never gone viral with the masses; partly 'cause he just can't break that 4th wall to get everyone hyped on his moves, and partly 'cause folks are jelly of power they don’t understand. the revolution that humanity dreams of, slowly brewing over ages, might just get yeeted into one wild year or one epic lifetime by him. people fear that in chasing his massive ambitions, he might ghost the common feels of humanity—too busy scanning the far-off future or retrograding into ancient flashbacks, missing those crazy events "tumbling out at his feet" (to borrow plato’s own words). and as plato would drop it, these philosopher-statesmen can get all kinds of twisted: either their natural resolve gets totally dimmed by overthinking, leaving them frozen when action is the move, or they drop broad, vague principles to mask a policy flip; or their cluelessness about the real world gets them rekt by others; or sometimes, they end up as courtier yes-men, rocking fancy liberal opinions without ever actually doing a dope deed. no wonder folk call these types pedants, sophisters, doctrinaires, visionaries—in other words, they've seen a bunch of whack imitations of the philosopher-statesman. but a dude who perfectly balances thought and action, staying woke in the now while flexing into the future—such a ruler in a legit constitutional state is something no one’s ever witnessed.

(d) so check it: plato, rocking what modern peeps might call a messy mental playlist, basically equates the state to a single homie and totally mixes up ethics with politics. he’s all about the vibe that a state is most legit when it’s essentially like one person, where every citizen shares the same drip. he totally misses that this analogy is half cap, because the character of a state is really just the extra flex of many individual wills, all limited by the need to squad up and act together. a crew of dudes never moves with the same fluidity as one lit lone wolf; and individual freedom—already limited—gets even more straightjacketed when it’s group mode. the power to act and feel naturally diffuses when spread out over a community, which fuels that classic question: "can a nation, like a single bro, have a conscience?" we’re not about to say that a nation’s vibe is just the sum of its individuals’ energies, ‘cause sometimes those individual trends mix and react in crazy ways. a whole nation might be way wiser than any one dude in it, or get hit with a collective spark that no single mind would ever snag, or even be hyped up by a genius leader to pull off superhuman moves. plato doesn’t really break down the chaos that comes from how humans roll together. plus, he can’t really tell when his analogies are straight-up bogus—sometimes they lack any real foundation, or he just can’t split what’s vividly in your brain from what’s truly real. in that arena, he’s lagging behind aristotle, who rarely gets duped by shady analogies. plato just can’t untangle art from virtue—he’s always sliding one into the other. his vibe for music, for instance, shifts from the harmony of sounds to the harmony of life; riding on the double meanings of language and those pyhtagorean feels. and once he’s merged the state with a single individual, he straight-up imagines that the sequence of states will mirror individual lives—talk about a brain yoink!

but yo, even through this kinda wack analogical mix-up, there's still a major mind-expansion happening. when virtues were still foggy in everyone’s brain, comparing them to the arts was a huge upgrade—since virtue is partly an art, flashing both an outer style and a deep inner code. the harmony of music gives a fire visual of the world's and human life's symphony, serving as a stellar illustration that some peeps mistook for a legit analogy. similarly, merging ethics with politics tends to lock in a clear vibe for ethics and raise our game regarding government goals and citizen duties; ethics can then be seen as an idealized law and politics, while politics becomes ethics dialed down to everyday reality. sure, trying to fuse them has spawned some major evils, and modern political writers have even split them apart into rival camps. but we can vibe that something epic got lost in that split—and that those ancient philosophers who put moral and brainy wellness on top of material wealth could totally drop some wisdom on today’s squad. many political maxims started as clap-backs against other errors; and once those errors fade, the maxims sometimes turn into sus errors themselves.

3. plato's edu vibes are, on so many levels, straight-up dope; like the rest of the republic, they're a mix of greek grind and ideal memes, starting with the everyday curriculum of greek youth and stretching all the way into the afterlife. plato was the first to drop that education means catching the full life flex and prepping you for a whole new level of edu—because learning never really stops, fam. this nonstop thread runs through the republic and is one of his ideas that totally slaps onto modern life.

he'd already peaced out on the idea that virtue is unteachable, and he's down to tweak protagoras's claim that there's only one virtue instead of many. he's cool with letting the real, sensory world slip into his truth scheme, and in the republic he doesn’t claim that vice happens involuntarily—as he did in the timaeus, sophist, and laws. and those so-called platonic ideas from an earlier existence? nah, they don't mess with his theory of leveling up your mind. still, you can catch that old socratic drip in him: true knowledge has gotta be mined from within and chased through ideas, not just the deets of what you sense. as he always says, education implants a brain-boost that’s way more lit than ten thousand extra eyes, no cap. the twin paradoxes—that all virtues are one, and that all virtue is knowledge—never fully get axed; the first vibes through the crown of justice over everything else, and the second in how moral vibes get sucked into intellectual streams, centering all that goodness on the idea of good itself. the sensory world still gets played down as just opinion, a shadow of the real deal. in the republic, it's crystal that plato believes vice mainly stems from ignorance and can be cured with proper education; the masses aren’t really to blame for their own missteps. there's even a lowkey nod to the doctrine of reminiscence in book ten; but plato’s take on edu isn’t really about tapping into some pre-game existence more than our own—it’s all about drawing out what’s already deep in the mind. for him, education ain’t about stuffing a vessel; it’s about flipping your soul’s eye toward the light.

he kicks things off with music and literature, splitting them into true vibes and fake vibes, then moves on to gymnastics. in the republic, he totally ignores the baby stage—even though in the laws he drops major wisdom on child care and how moms should roll, even proposing an edu plan that starts before birth. but in the republic, he begins with the age when a kid’s ready to catch ideas, and he boldly claims—in language that might sound totally paradoxical to modern ears—that a kid must peep the fake before they can learn the true. modern and ancient philosophy aren’t on the same wavelength about truth and fake; modern peeps almost tie truth strictly to facts, while ancient brains see it in pure ideas. that's one of the diff notes between us and plato, though it's partly just wordplay. we gotta admit that a kid will catch tons of lessons imperfectly; some stuff is taught only in pictures, some even beyond what he can really believe later—but we should only use fiction as needed. plato draws his line differently; for him, early edu isn’t about hard facts, but about truth as a principle. a kid first learns basic religious truths, then simple moral truths, slowly soaking in lessons on good manners and taste. he’d flip the old mythology script; like xenophanes and heracleitus, he's super aware of the huge gap between his era and that of homer and hesiod—whom he quotes and gives fake street cred, solely for his own agenda. the wild desires and backstabbing of the gods need to be banished; the terrors of the underworld gotta be ghosted; and the shady antics of homeric heroes aren’t the role models for the youth. but yo, there’s another vibe in homer that can school our kids on endurance, and even some basic medicine lessons from homeric times. the core principles for religion boil down to two: first, that god is the real deal; and second, that god is pure good. modern and christian writers often miss these beats—they barely go beyond them.

the young gotta be raised in an environment that’s all about good vibes—away from any sketchy sights or sounds that might mess with their character or ruin their taste. they should chill in a healthy atmosphere, with a constant fresh breeze dropping hints of truth and pure goodness. if we could nail that kinda education, or if modern religious edu could be tied up with truth, virtue, good manners, and solid taste, that would be the ultimate glow-up for humanity. plato, just like us, is hyped for changes in the moral and religious scene and is busy prepping for them. he’s all too aware of the danger of shaking up young minds with sudden flips of laws and principles—destroying a sacred set of ideas when nothing else is ready to fill the void. he’s also lowkey scared of the drama scene, since it pumps out fake feels, so he wouldn’t let his kids hit the theatre; he reckons the impact on both the viewers and the players is all bad news. his idea of education is all about balanced, harmonious growth, where you slowly soak in lessons on chill, endurance, and self-control, letting both body and mind level up in sync. the top rule running through all art and nature is simplicity—and that’s the vibe that should rule human life.

yo, stage two of edu is all about gym class – think of it as that phase for flexin’ muscles and leveling up your gains. just like how they keep music chill and simple, gym vibes are all about smooth, no-frills moves. plato was hella clued in that training your bod might totally clash with leveling up your brain, and you can def go too hard on those physical reps. too much body hustle can leave you with a wicked headache or have you snoozin’ through a philosophy lecture – and folks be blaming the subject instead of the extra reps. plato dropped two epic tea bombs about gym class: first, that gym time is completely split from lit ed time. he was all, “nah fam, you can’t mash together two vibes that are total opposites.” lowkey, if you spend your teens (14 to 17) bustin’ out in the gym 24/7, your brain’s not gonna snag that scholar drip. secondly, he claimed that both music and gym aren’t meant one for your mind and the other just for your bod; they’re both 100% about upgrading your brain. in his flex, the body is merely the hype sidekick to the mind – when the mind’s on that constant grind (not just random spurts), it runs the whole show for life. sure, other greek OGs like aristotle and thucydides peeped some sus side effects of spartan discipline, but only plato could call out the fundamental fail in that system.

next up, gym class vibes slide into its sis subject: medicine. plato then drops a law analogy like it’s hot. nowadays, a ton of peeps be like “nah, medicine ain’t it,” so there’s been a mad call for keeping things simple – docs are finally realizing they sometimes make diseases way more extra by overcomplicating their treatments. in two thousand years, medical art’s only flexed a little; what they nail by dissecting the parts gets lost when they’re sleepwalking on the big picture of human health. they’ve been so into curing the sick that they totally ghosted on keeping us in peak shape with regular training. until recently, nobody gave a damn about air and water – which those ancient homies knew were straight-up essentials. as aristotle dropped, “air and water, being the elements we use most, pack the biggest punch for health” (politics vibes, ya dig). for ages, docs were stuck in outdated biases that only recently got yeeted; now, opinions in medicine are as wild as those in theology, with equal amounts of skepticism and zero tolerance for BS on both sides. plato came through with some dope notions about medicine: like, “the eye can’t be fixed without the rest of the bod, nor the bod without the mind” (charm flex). according to him in the timaeus, no smart dude would just roll with medicine alone; and in the laws he’s all, “yo, those farmhands grindin’ hard get more benefit from a warm soak than from a clueless doc’s pills.” but gotta keep it 100—we can barely vibe with him when, following homer’s authority, he disses diet or goes full savage by literally letting invalid, extra lives yeet themselves into oblivion. seems like he never peeped that the “bridle of theages” could come with qualities way more clutch for the state than just physical strength, or that taking care of the weak should be a core part of state edu. plus, real talk—the doc himself, in modern lingo, shouldn’t be some mega hulk of health; he should be rocking a nervous vibe, having survived his own sick battles so his observation game stays on fleek when spotting others in the struggle.

man, the messy biz of medicine is matched by the chaos of law, and here too plato was all about that golden rule of simplicity. the big, heavy matters? leave ‘em to the lawmakers or even the oracle of delphi. the tiny deets? those are for citizens to wing for a minute. plato totally got that letting peeps do their own thing is key in government. a state’s problems are like a hydra’s heads—cut one off and bam, they multiply. the real fix isn’t in snipping stuff away but in preempting the drama altogether. the hack? invest in solid edu, ‘cause then life’s rest of the drama can handle itself. in modern times, peeps be thinking the only political move worth dropping is a full-on national edu flex. more than ever, we’re all in on the idea of smoothing out law’s chaos with simple, real talk.

after you clock off from your jam sessions in music and those gym grind reps, you hit the first level of big public life. but hold up—edu then flips the script from a fresh angle. between book four and book seven, we broke down what knowledge really even is and got led to a next-level idea of what’s expected of us. true knowledge, according to plato, isn’t down with the petty deets of individuals—it’s about that universal drip, not the pretty poetry vibes but the mega ideas of philosophy. the ultimate edu flex is building that habit of abstraction, and that’s only unlocked through the math sciences. only math can drop ideas on how things relate and wake up those lazy brain cells.

back in plato’s day, math was just a tiny slice of what we rock with now—but it was still the biggest drip in the sum of human knowledge. it was the only tool the human mind had to turn chaotic details into order and rule. math was the sole brain organon that kept things on fleek, and it clashed hard with all that wild, poetic imagination. so for plato—who was forever on the hunt for pure abstractions and canceling out sensory illusions—edu was nearly all wrapped up in math. math had a mad, almost limitless application, partly ‘cause nobody yet clocked its real boundaries. plato himself started diving into this, even if he didn’t fully peep that numbers and shapes were just savage abstractions from the senses. he was on a mission to find the ultimate base of mathematical ideas in the idea of good, though he kinda left us hangin’ on how they really connected; and when it came to linking ideas to numbers, he seriously fell short of the hard facts that aristotle later dropped. but if he missed math’s true limits, he still leveaped up past ‘em: in his view, number vibes become secondary to a higher conception of knowledge. the dialectician is on a whole other level compared to the math nerd—like math peeps are just basic compared to the big-brain dialectic squad. that self-validating, supreme good from dialectic is the perfect truth where everything eventually chills out.

so check it—the self-proving unity, or idea of good, is basically a vibe you catch that no one can break down exactly, and it’s only framed that way in a specific stage of greek philosophy. it’s an abstraction that doesn’t include any one-offs, a total whole with literally no side parts (as aristotle drops in the nic. eth.). plato kinda missed that the dialectic process is a mash-up of conflicting methods and didn’t peep that whether you roll the long way or take the short cut, you ain’t really leveling up progress that way. even so, these vague visions pack a massive punch; ‘cause even if science methods can’t predict the next flip, the idea of science—not as it is now but as it’s gonna be—is a dope, inspiring force. in the chase for knowledge, we’re always pushing toward something beyond our current drip; and while false vibes (like that wack scholastic philosophy) might lead peeps astray for ages, the empty ideal can still guide thoughts in the right direction. it all comes down to whether our general feel for knowledge is built on real, solid judgment. even if we only peep a sliver of actual facts, we can still have a legit idea of what knowledge should be. syncing up the sciences, feeling the unity of nature, classifying stuff, keeping proportions on point, and never settling for half-baked certainties – these are the core principles of higher edu. plato might’ve been like, “i got nothing solid to say about absolute truth” (and maybe he knew it), but his influence still drops knowledge bombs today, with his thoughts sparking fresh takes on political and social tea.

the idea of good is only dubbed that in the republic, but you can spot its traces in other plato dialogues too. it’s both a cause and a vibe, kinda like the creator in timaeus who, riding on his goodness, made everything. it vibes with our modern take on nature’s laws or a final cause, or even both mashed into one, and it even links up with the measure and symmetry in the philebus. in the symposium, it’s shown off as beauty, and you’re supposed to level up to it in stages, just like the regular steps of knowledge. subjectively, it’s the whole process of dialectic—that is, the science that, according to phaedrus, is the real backbone of dope rhetoric, the one that can peep the true nature and squad of people and things; that slices a whole into its natural squad pieces and then pulls ‘em back together into one legit order; that defines the abstract, universal deets of all things and connects them; that cuts through all the bogus hypotheses to hit that final cause or first principle; and that scopes out all sciences in relation to the idea of good. this ideal science is the ultimate flex of thought—it’s like the soul chattin’ with itself or vibin’ with eternal truth and beauty, or even that endless socratic meme fest of non-stop Q&A. plato’s own dialogues are prime demos of how dialectic runs. seen objectively, the idea of good is that powerhouse that makes the outer, idea-filled world match up with our inner world. but even that outer world is just a realm of pure vibes. for plato, exploring nature was just another intel phase, where he only went for the most probable conclusions (just like in timaeus).

if we’re askin’ whether plato’s half-explained science of dialectic leans more toward logic or metaphysics, he was like, “yo, i don’t even split ‘em up” – much like how german philosophy later split the subjective and objective vibes of the world. he didn’t even clock whether his dialectic chill was static or on the move, if it was all about pondering absolute being or riding the wave of evolution. in modern terms, metaphysics is the science of abstract drip or the evolution of thought, and modern logic—when it ditches the old aristotelian forms—is basically the science of method. the seeds of both are already locked in plato’s dialectic; all metaphysicians got some of plato’s sauce, and every logic nerd has scooped up something from his method. the closest modern match to plato’s universal science is in hegel’s “succession of moments in the unity of the idea.” both plato and hegel were vibing that the world’s just a mash-up of abstractions—and bet, they’d likely understand each other way better than all those random commentators, like in that wild account from swift’s voyage to laputa: i set aside a day to peep at those ancients famed for wit and learning, and i was like, “yo, homer and aristotle should front the commentary squad,” but there were so many that hundreds had to crash the palace courts. i peeped homer immediately—taller, way more lit, struttin’ with eyes that practically yeeted lasers—while aristotle was all stooped with a lame staff, lookin’ meager with lank, thin hair and a hollow vibe. turns out, they were total unknowns to the rest of the crew, and i even caught wind from a ghost (who stays nameless) that these commentators were always posted in the darkest corners ‘cause they so extra misrepresented the true vibes of these legends. i even linked didymus and eustathius up with homer, convincing him to treat them like the genius newbies they were, while aristotle totally lost patience with my breakdown of scotus and ramus, asking them if the rest of their tribe were as big dunces as they were. still, there’s a diff: while hegel sees all human minds as one mega vibe evolving across lands and eras, plato only saw these levels as different orders of thought—the whole saga of the human brain’s glow-up wasn’t even on his radar yet.

yo, there’s a ton of critiques on plato’s theory of edu. on one hand, he totally falls short compared to modern flex, but on the flip side, he was ahead of his time. he was straight-up against the edu modes of his era, but can’t really be credited with inventing new ones. he didn’t peep that edu should vibe with each individual’s character; he was all about stamping the same state blueprint on everyone’s mind. plus, he totally ghosted the impact of literature on shaping the brain while hyping math way too hard. his main mission was to train our reasoning skills—to smash that abstraction power into our heads, break down and define general ideas, and ideally hook ‘em all together. no wonder that, in the void of real knowledge, his squad (and even sometimes him) bailed on the whole doctrine of ideas and slid back to the realm where only numbers could truly show the link between the one and the many—the science of number. in his teaching and training vibe, you could call him a total doctrinaire; he would’ve had his citizens molded in a spartan cookie-cutter style, not giving a thought that a little freedom—a bit of wholesome neglect—is key to building character and letting individual swag shine. as a result, his peeps wouldn’t pick up that deep knowledge which, in er’s vision, comes from riding out life’s messed-up experiences.

but on the flip side, plato was way ahead of modern philosophers and theologians when he dropped that edu should roll on for life and reboot in every new phase. he’d never let edu just tap out; even if solon’s “i grow old learning many things” is more of a poetic flex than a literal motto. totally obsessed with the idea of good and stanning solid geometry (rep style), he legit imagined a lifetime spent vibin’ on that scholarly grind. real talk though, we know there are way more business hustlers in the world than true students or brainy thinkers, so we aren’t riding that same optimism wave. the edu he proposes for his citizens is the ultimate life of a philosopher or genius—interrupted only briefly by real-world duties; it’s a life not meant for the many, but for the few chosen ones.

but yo, even if plato’s ideas seem like an unattainable dream, they might still massively level up our modern squad—elevating humanity above the mundane hustle of everyday jobs. it’s like the ultimate blueprint for life. the catch, though, is that plato’s ideal is mad tough to pull off. the edu for later life is something each one’s gotta DIY for themselves. you can’t just cram 40- or 50-year-olds into colleges and expect ’em to glow up—and even if you could, the results would probably be a major flop. most peeps are content chillin’ in what plato would call “the den” for life. they ain’t got teachers or gurus to give them real talk on their flaws, to fire them up with a higher sense of duty, or to push them toward some true, monumental success; there’s no socrates to call ’em out on their ignorance, no christ or his squad to school ’em on sin. so, without that crucial first spark of self-knowledge, they’re stuck. the fire of youth just doesn’t hit the same anymore—most would rather crash than chase big dreams. only a few, who have crossed paths with true legends or insightful teachers of morality and religion, have caught that second wind and lit a candle from the blaze of genuine genius.

lackin’ that hype is one of the main reasons why so few peeps keep glowin’ up in their later years. they just ain’t got the “lets get this bread” vibe, and they totally don’t know the cheat codes. they never slide into an experiment or even peep a new dank topic for themselves; they ain’t willing to sacrifice that clout for knowledge, and their brains—just like their bods—get stuck on a lag, like an old phone stuck on a glitch.

people used to call genius “the grind mode juice” or the power of hustlin’ hard; but ngl, hardly anyone keeps those knowledge vibes lit for a whole lifetime. family drama, chasin’ that bag, and the grind of adultin’ snatch away your brain’s flex. that wax-on, wax-off memory board which used to snag only true thoughts and clear impressions eventually hardens and gets hella crowded—no room left for a lifetime’s worth of digi-upgrades (theaet.). as you glow up, the student ends up swappin’ knowledge like a trade deal instead of stackin’ new intel. there ain’t that urgent need to study; the classics, history, or nat sci stash that powered a dude at twenty-five is still a solid load at fifty.

yo, it’s mad hard to drop a one-size-fits-all hack when someone asks “how do i level up?” ‘cause self-edu is like a thousand mini side quests, each basic on its own—stackin’ what you naturally got with bits of what you ain’t, learning to see yourself like others peep you, judgin’ solely by the facts and not by random opinions, squad-up with next-level mind homies, dive into the lives and scrolls of legends, peep the world and its character, soak up the natural vibes of life’s different eras, and anytime you do a move or spark a thought that rises above basic normie opinions, you’re callin’ forth that hidden mental beast by chasin’ some fresh, original side quest.

if you’re down to fully flex some platonic afterlife edu deets, here are some pro tips: choose that subject branch your brain vibes with the hardest – one that either totally clicks with your daily hustle or gives you the sickest contrast to it. you can deep-dive into your own biz from a speculative, theory-level angle. vibe with legends like homer, dante, shakespeare, plato, bacon as your ride-or-die crew. snag chances to catch the live drip of a dope mentor, or scope out some epic historical tea or a wild, unexplained nature glitch. droppin’ just an hour a day on these lit scientific or literary quests will stack mad facts in your memory vault and deliver a pleasure that’s, like, no regrets (timaeus style). but yo, beware of gettin’ played as a slave to petty quirks or rushin’ after ghost vibes in your own ignorance, or flexin’ like you’re the next poet laureate or philosopher king. know your power cap, fam—better to creep along slowly, stacking new brain gains one subtle move at a time, rather than schemin’ giant plays that never actually pop off. maybe, as plato might say, “this is part of another thread” (tim.), though we can totally slide into that tangent with his own drip (theaet.).

4. yo, it’s wild how nation glow-ups or org upgrades that fill our modern pol-sci scrolls never even got a nod from plato and aristotle. the old heads were real with the fact that human affairs are mad sketchy; they’d sit by crumbled cities and fallen empires and drop moral lectures (plato, statesman, and sulpicus’ letter to cicero). to them, fate and chance were like legit power players, almost like actual peeps, and had a huge say in the political game. the smarter ancient squad, like thucydides, was vibing “what was will def be again,” and you could peep a decent future hack straight from the past.

they even dreamed of a golden era that was lit back in the day and might still pop off somewhere secret, or bounce back sometime in the far future. but yo, the real-deal evolution of a state—levelin’ up with life experience, unlocking fresh knowledge, and flexin’ in the arts, where citizens get schooled on their civic duties—just wasn’t in their playbook. that kind of state had never been seen IRL, so it was totally off their radar. their life stats (aristotle, metaph.; plato, laws) had ‘em believing in cyclical civilizations: arts discovered and lost on loop, cities getting wrecked and rebuilt over and over, with floods, volcanoes, and other wild natural glitches remixing the whole planet. ancient tradition spilled tea on epic mankind wipeouts with a few survivors left in the mix. the world would hit that reset button after a deluge and rebuild itself from its own old shards. they even knew of super ancient empires like the egyptians or assyrians; but since they never caught them mid-glow-up, they couldn’t imagine—any more than we can—the state of humanity before those times. they were shook and lowkey in awe of the egyptian monuments, with forms which, as plato claims, weren’t just figures but literally like ten freakin’ thousand years old (laws), and they always compared egypt’s epic status with their own tinier memory span.

the early legends of hellas aren’t really linked to later history—they’re way out there, with the middle chapter totally hidden from view; there’s no clear path or cheat code connecting one to the other. at the start of greek history, right in the temple’s lobby, you’d peep the legislator’s figure first and foremost—the ultimate interpreter and ride-or-die servant of the god. his core laws were meant to be forever, unchanging no matter what wild vibes time and circumstances threw at them. the state’s glow-up was believed to depend entirely on locking those rules down hard. they had the heavenly seal of approval, and switchin’ ‘em up was straight-up sacrilege. that crazy drive to keep things old school seems to be the root of what now looks extra to us—the intolerant heat of plato against any new flex in religion or pol vibes (laws)—even though in a funny twist he was also cool with scoping out other countries’ laws and droppein’ private legislative upgrades to his nocturnal council (laws). any tweaks made later to handle life’s extra complexity were still, like, fake-ass credited to the original legislator, and at athens people argued over those decrees like they were solon’s own iconic lines. plato was all about preserving that OG legislator mindset for the next gen; he wanted his citizens to stick within the blueprint he laid down. he wasn’t about harassin’ them with petty micro-rules—he’d be down for some changes as long as they didn’t mess with the state’s core vibe, like flippin’ an aristocracy into a timocracy or a timocracy into a full-on people-run squad.

passing from theory to straight-up facts, we peep that progress is the rare drop in human history, not the constant grind. so it’s no shocker that the whole progress vibe is more of a modern flex than an ancient one—and, like the whole philosophy of history, it’s only like a century or two old. it seems to have popped off from the massive impression left on minds by the roman empire and the christian church, thanks to all those epic pol and social upgrades they slid into the world; and even more so in our own era with the first french revolution hype and the american independence win; and then even bigger with the crazy material glow-up and population boom in england, its colonies, and america. plus, a chunk of it comes from peepin’ more into the philosophy of history. the upbeat moods of some legendary writers helped spark it, while a few downers viewed the world’s future as totally dark. the “spectator of all time” now sees mad layers of that age-long trending purpose that weren’t even on the radar for someone chillin’ in a tiny hellas state—their vision was mad limited like the narrow valley they lived in. there wasn’t an epic old timeline for their eyes to rest on, nor a future where the cover could be half-raised by a history analogy. that super narrow view, which now seems nuts to us, was just how it had to be for them.

5. as for how the republic vibes with the statesman and the laws—and the other two plato works that are full-on pol talk—peep the intros to those later drops; here’s some general tea for comparison.

and first up, the laws.

(1) the republic, even though it was probably dropped in batches, basically vibes with plato’s mid-era drip—judgin’ by its lit thoughts and style. the laws, on the other hand, are def from his late game, with chunks soundin’ like they were penned in his extreme old age.

(2) the republic is all hype, hope, and big dreams; the laws, though, come stamped with a vibe of failure and mad disappointment. one’s a fully finished masterpiece with the author’s final polish, while the other feels half-baked and unfinished. the republic radiates that youthful grace and lit beauty, while the laws lost that poetic sparkle but got more of the hardcore, life-wise truth that only old age can drop.

(3) a major L for the laws is that they totally miss that dramatic punch—while the republic’s packed with bold contrasts in ideas and a savage showdown of characters.

(4) the laws lean more into that sermon-like energy, while the republic is a straight-up poem; one’s heavy with religious feelz, the other dripping with intellectual heat.

(5) a bunch of plato’s theories—like the whole doctrine of ideas and a philosopher-run world—don’t even show up in the laws; the whole soul immortality flex only pops up in book xii, and socrates is completely ghosted. even the whole crew of women and kiddos as a community is nixed; meanwhile, the concept of shared communal meals for women (laws) drops for the very first time (ar. pol.).

(6) and yo, the laws still carry that old-school beef against poets—they get hyped up in fancy, high-flown terms one minute, then get straight-up yeeted out of the city if they won’t submit their verses to the magistrates’ censorship (rep.).

(7) even though the laws are lower-key in most respects, there are still some fire passages—like giving mad honor to the soul, callin’ out the evils of sketchy, unnatural love, the whole book x (religion), and dissin’ shady retail trade and will drama—that hit closer to our modern vibes than almost anything in the republic.

here’s how the two works stack up to each other:

(1) according to aristotle in the politics, peepin’ the laws side, he drops: “same, or nearly the same, beef applies to plato’s later drop, the laws, so we best do a quick run-down on the constitution laid out in it. in the republic, socrates only locked down a few deets—like the squad community for women and kids, shared property, and the overall state setup. the population splits into two cliques—one for husbandmen and one for warriors; and from the warrior crew, a third tier of counselors and state rulers is carved out. but socrates never said if the husbandmen and artists should have a say in the gov, or even carry arms and join the military grind. he’s all about letting women share in guardian ed and fight right alongside. the rest of that work is full of off-topic tangents and endless guardian edu discussions. in the laws, it’s almost all about the rules; not much is said 'bout the constitution. what he once meant to be the everyday model, he slowly flips to the ideal form. basically, except for the community bits on women and property, he figures everything else stays consistent across both states—same ed vibes, citizens livin’ free of lowly jobs, and communal grub sessions on lock. the only diff is that in the laws communal meals get extended to women, and the warrior count bumps up to about 5000, while in the republic it’s only 1000.”

(2) as plato drops it in the laws (book v.), from the republic’s angle, he spits: “the first and highest level of a state, its government, and its law is the one that rocks that ancient vibe of ‘friends share all the swag.’ whether or not this full-on communal setup of women, kids, and property—where all that’s private (like eyes, ears, hands) goes common, and everyone dishes out praise, blame, joy, and sorrow at the same moments, with the laws uniting the city totally—is even possible, i’m sayin’ no one following any other playbook will ever build a state as lit in virtue, truth, or excellence as this. a state like that, whether stacked with gods or their born heirs, will bless its homies; and this is the blueprint we gotta chase, the ideal we cling to, and the one we must seek out. the state we’re cookin’ up now, when it drops, will be the closest to that immortality and squad unity; and then, by god’s grace, we’ll nail the third level. now, let’s kick off by chattin’ about the vibe and origin of that second level.”

the shorter drop called the statesman (or politicus), with its extra chill vibe and style, leans more toward the laws in looks but, in idealism, vibes mad similar to the republic. based on the language and thought cues, it’s gotta be dated after the republic but before the laws. in both the republic and the statesman, there’s a tight link between pol and dialectic. in the statesman, deep dives into method principles mix with pol debates. they weigh up the perks of letting law run the show versus a boss individual (arist. pol.), though you could go the other route too—because a boss can rule with law, and law can be the living voice of that OG legislator. just like in the republic, there’s a myth here—not about a future drop but about mankind’s past existence. the big question thrown down is: “is that state of pure innocence from the myth, or a state like ours that’s packed with art, science, and the ability to tell good af from evil, the ultimate win for mankind?” to that debate over which vibe—civilized swank or raw primitive life—is the better flex, which got mad discussion in the last century and in our own, no solid answer is dropped. the statesman, although not as stylistically fire as the republic and with a much smaller range, still stands as one of plato’s all-time greatest dialogue bops.

6. other peeps besides plato have picked an ideal republic as the ride to drop thoughts they couldn’t fully express or that were totally beyond their era. the classical spin that comes closest to plato’s republic is cicero’s “de republica”; but ngl, in that or any of his dialogues he never quite hits plato’s art level. his style’s clunky and low-key weak—the hand of the rhetorician is on full display at every turn. yet, every now and then, noble feels still pop up: that true roman patriotism vibe of “we romans are a great people” echoes through his work. like socrates, cicero ditches the celestial drama to deep-dive into civil and pol life. he’d rather skip jawin’ about the “two suns” everyone in rome was buzzin’ about and instead break down the “two nations in one” that had split rome since the gracchi days. and just like socrates, when channelin’ scipio, he’s lowkey scared of comin’ off too teacher-like, preferring instead to kick it as an equal with the squad, choppin’ it up on both sides of a debate. he sticks to reservin’ the titles king or state for vibes ruled by reason and justice, dissing both democracy and monarchy for that role. but under reason and justice, he’s down to let the natural top-tier rule over the natural underdogs—just like the soul bossing the body. he’s all about a mash-up of government styles rather than one single flavor. the two portraits of the just and the unjust that drop in book two of the republic get flipped into state mode—with philus, one of the squad, grudgingly admitin’ that a bit of injustice is needed for gov rule, while laelius backs the totally opposite spin. his takes on language and numbers straight-up come from plato; like plato, he disses the dramatic fluff. he also drops that if his life was twice as long, there’d be zero time for readin’ those lyric poets. his word-for-word breakdown of democracy is on point, even though he never really managed to “carry the jest” like plato. he transforms a meme about animals—who are so soaked in the spirit of democracy that they force passers-by to scoot aside—into a formal, stately line. his description of the tyrant is a direct dip from plato, but it’s way more low-key. the second book is all historical, claiming that the roman constitution (which he vibes as the ideal) is built on actual facts—way more factual than what plato probably aimed for in the critias for the republic.

his most epic plato imitation is the remix of er’s vision, which cicero flips into the “somnium scipionis”; he basically “romanizes” the republic myth, droppin’ in an argument for the soul’s immortality borrowed straight from the phaedrus along with other nods from the phaedon and the timaeus. even though it’s a beautiful tale loaded with sick passages, the “somnium scipionis” is mad inferior to er’s original vision—it’s just a dream, barely enough for the reader to feel that the writer even believes in his own creation. whether his dialogues were modeled on the lost dialogues of aristotle—as he claims—or on plato’s style, which they only mimic on the surface, he’s still just the roman orator; he’s not chillin’ in convo mode but spittin’ speeches, and he can never quite smooth that intractable latin into the graceful, easy flow of a greek platonic dialogue. and if his form is hella defective, he’s way more subpar content-wise; nowhere in his philosophical drops does he leave the vibe of an original thinker.

plato's republic was lowkey more of a holy church vibe than your basic state, no cap; this celestial city dream has been hovering over the christian world like a cosmic influencer, and st. augustine even flexed it in his 'de civitate dei' – a wild nod to the decay and epic fall of the roman empire, much like how we can peep that plato's republic got its inspo from the slow drip decline of greek politics in his own time.

difference tho: in plato's days the degeneracy was sus but coming in all gradual and lowkey, so you wouldn’t even catch the vibe failing. then boom—the goths yeeted rome like an earthquake, and st. augustine’s era hit with major tremors, shaking up the whole scene fr fr.

folks back then were like, "yo, the city got clapped ‘cause the old roman deities were straight-up salty about getting ghosted on their worship," while st. augustine came in with the savage counter drop, arguing that the roman empire got roasted not by the rise of christianity but by the shady vices of paganism.

he roamed through roman history, greek philosophy, and mythology like a deep scroll on ancient cringe—discovering crime, deadbeat impiety, and straight-up falsehood on every page. then he threw down a savage comparison, roasting the worst of gentile religions next to the clean, lit vibes of christ's faith. totally missing, though, was that cosmic spirit which had early christian fathers vibing with greek philosophers’ divine truth tweets.

he flexed by mapping out an epic parallel: the kingdom of god—think jewish squad history in their ancient scriptures—and all the worldly kingdoms penned by gentile writers, both cruising toward some idealized future like a legendary crossover event. and, no big tea spill here, his scoop of greek and roman historians plus jewish sacred scrolls was served unfiltered, without any fact-check – pure ancient lore drip.

he treated heathen mythology, sybilline oracles, plato's epic myths, and neo-platonist daydreams as straight-up matter-of-fact, like they were the ultimate truth. real talk: the dude was a hardcore polemic troll who served the dopest highlights on one side and the trashiest takes on the flip—mixing fire memes with boomer rants for all the drama.

he wasn’t vibing with the old roman life like plato did with greek life, nor did he have any clue about that ecclesiastical kingdom that was bound to rise from rome’s ashes. the guy wasn’t blind to the christian church’s cringe fails, and he was hyped for a future drop where both christian and pagan squads get hauled before the judgment-seat, letting the real city of god make its epic debut.

st. augustine's opus is this wild mixtape of antiquated learning and quoted throwbacks, drenched in christian ethics but kinda weak on the reasoning front and with a super skimpy grasp of greek literature and lingo—like a mismanaged meme folder. the genius dude was undeniably brilliant and noble, yet he was so locked into his own theology that nothing outside of it could even hit his heart or mind. among the ancient philosophers, he was totally drawn to plato—even if he only gave his writings a shallow scroll. he lowkey thought the creation vibes in the timaeus were just a remix of genesis, and he was shook by the accidental (or maybe not so accidental?) alignment of plato's "the philosopher is the lover of god" and the exodus where god drops the ultimate reveal to moses.

he went off at length about the miracles in his own day, treating the evidence as 100% no-cap and totally irresistible. his flow when talking about the beauty and utility of nature and the human bod was straight-up lit—offering a sneak peek into that heavenly upgrade and the ultimate body resurrection glitch. the book, real talk, isn’t what its title might make you think; it’s a relic from a cancelled age, yet it’s packed with timeless bangers and deep thoughts that still slap today.

next up, dante's de monarchia is the ultimate micro-treatise of medieval idealism—a peak vibe that flexes the genius which had italy and the middle ages lit AF. it's a vision of a universal empire, the natural and necessary global squad in charge, ruled by a divine authority that’s separate from the papacy yet riding in tandem with it. this isn’t some ghost of the dead roman empire sittin' on its grave; it’s the legit heir, the boss successor validated by ancient roman virtues and the bomb rule of their beneficence.

their right to govern the world is backed by miracle tea spills, acknowledged by st. paul when he hollered at caesar, and even more emphatically by christ himself—who couldn’t have pulled off atonement for humanity’s sins if he hadn’t been roasted by a divinely sanctioned tribunal. the need for a universal empire drops both a priori ammo—like the unity of god and fam or nation—and twisted takes from scripture, messed up historical analogies, off-brand classic quotes, and logic scraps; all chalking up to a vibe of familiar yet fuzzy aristotle nods (and nada from plato, smh). but the real clincher is the utterly trash world scene, which he paints with such touching feels that he sees no hope for human happiness or chill until every nation locks into one global empire. the whole treatise is a savage meme about how deeply the roman empire idea was stuck in his peeps' heads, a truth so natural and on fleek that hardly any debate was needed. he was spitting—or more like preaching—not from a church suit but from a layman's grind, though as a true catholic he admitted that sometimes the empire gotta bow to the church. the epic beginning and finale of all his noble rants is that aspiration where life on our little mortal plot should roll in freedom and peace—a vision so tightly woven with his era’s vibe that it’s inseparable.

moving on, sir thomas more's utopia is a wild monument of genius that stretches way beyond his contemporaries’ basic thinking. written when he was about 34 or 35, it’s dripping with youthful generosity. more brought in that plato-level enlightenment to shine a light on his country’s dumpster fire—post-wars-of-the-roses and deep in the mess of england's catholic church—where he was straight-up pouting at the clergy's corruption, the extra flex of nobility, the poor getting clapped by life, and war-caused chaos.

in more's eyes, the whole world was falling apart—dissolving and decaying—but alongside the misery and oppression he dished out in the first book of utopia, he drops an ideal state blueprint in the second book, built with heavy plato vibes. the era was buzzing with mad intellectual stir, and you could almost catch the lowkey remix of the reformation humming in the distance. for more, greek literature was an epic revelation that unlocked a next-gen art of decoding texts, making the new testament hit like raw truth that’s rarely ever seen again.

utopia’s life looked nothing like the mainstream christian commonwealths, which were just rich dudes scheming for their own gain under that title. more believed that christ, much like plato, was the OG who set everything to common—so the utopians were all in on that communal drip, keeping it 100 in true christian style. the whole property-community vibe was set in stone for him, even though he was aware of the other side’s chatter; as he put it, riding with plato meant no laws for anyone denying equal share of all riches—a wise move that the truly woke foresaw as the only route to community wealth.

and yo, how did peeps in henry viii’s reign even vibe with such wild speculations, cloaked in another lingo and dropped in a foreign land? such endurance is wild, no cap. more was on a next-level dramatic flex, outdoing almost everyone after him (except the savage swift), and in the art of faking it, he was a legit plato disciple. starting from a tiny fact nugget—just a few lines in the latin chronicles of amerigo vespucci's voyages—he built his whole epic tale with mad precision on dates and details, making us believe the narrator was an actual eyewitness.

we’re left hella puzzled by his mix-up of real and made-up peeps—blending his boy john clement and peter giles from antwerp, who he argued with over the exact words that the (imaginary) portuguese traveler raphael hythloday dropped. hythloday was like, "i legit got more reason to worry that my words won’t hit the trust level, ‘cause i know how hella hard i’d struggle to believe some other dude if i hadn’t seen it live myself." then he fires off another line: "if you had been riding with me in utopia, seen their fresh fits and lit laws firsthand over five years or more, you’d know i wasn’t just chilling there—I was there to drop the deets about this new land," and so on.

more seriously regretted not asking hythloday exactly where utopia was at—he’d have dropped mad coin rather than letting that info slip, and he begged peter giles to either meet or message hythloday for the deets. after that, it wasn’t shocking to hear that some professor of divinity (maybe "a late famous vicar of croydon in surrey," as our translator thinks) was all hyped to be sent there as a missionary by the high bishop—hell yes, even dreaming of becoming the bishop of utopia, all in that godly zeal vibe not for clout or coin. the master plan might have gone sideways because hythloday dipped out—leaving very uncertain tea on his whereabouts—but no cap, he did spill the full deets on the island to more and giles before more’s attention got yeeted by a servant and a shipmate’s brutal cough drowned out giles’s ears. so, the secret got lost in the sauce—and to this day, utopia’s location remains mystery central.

peep phaedrus’ line, "o socrates, you can easily invent egyptians or anything," and it totally vibes with this hyper-real fiction. yet the top-tier merit of the work isn’t just in its dope art—it’s in its original, brain-dropping thoughts. more was as free-spirited as plato in ditching old-age biases and way more tolerant. the utopians didn’t let anyone who didn’t vibe with soul immortality join the state’s crew (in the laws), though they didn’t diss them hard either since they figured belief is a free-for-all. also, nobody should get dragged for backing their own faith—one dude even got clapped right after baptism for going way too extra, dissing all other creeds and calling them devilish and doomed; he got booted out not for hating religion but for being too sassy and stirring up serious tea.

in public vibes they were like, "nah fam, no scripted prayers here; just let each person drop their own bold prayer that doesn’t flame any sect." he even drops a major truth bomb: some peeps worship a dude for his epic virtue and glory, viewing him as the top-tier god—but the real geniuses, tossing all that extra clout aside, believe in this mysterious, uber godly power way beyond human brainpower, spreading its virtue and force all over the place. they call him the father of all, and to him alone they credit the start, growth, hustle, flips, and ultimate wrap of everything—no other gets a divine shout-out. so, more was totally not riding the mainstream belief train of his era; but in the finale he throws in a saving clause, reminding us he’s not 100% on board with every utopian custom he dished out. let’s give him that break rather than madly ghosting his hidden self.

more was also way ahead of his time in politics and morals—flipping military glory into total cringe and remixing every idle squad member (priests, women, noblemen, gents, even "sturdy and valiant beggars") into productive hustlers so that the daily grind would only be six hours max. his extra vibe against capital punishment and his plans to reform offenders, his savage diss for priests and lawyers (peep his line: "the utopians got priests so holy it’s barely even a squad"), and his roast that "everyone hears about savage dogs, wolves, and man-eaters but finding a state run with wisdom is ultra rare" were all way off the beaten, boomer track—even compared to his own life.

the dude drops mad modern feels and prophet-level insights, channeling serious plato energy. he was a sanitation boss who argued that civilized states could totally claim the land of wasted trash countries, and he believed that happiness comes straight from virtuous pleasure—aligning with those brainy peeps who say virtue means living in tune with nature. he extended the happiness flex to include making others happy too, arguing genius level, "all men agree we should level up others, so imagine how lit it is when we boost ourselves as well!" yet he still thought there might be a next-tier way that no mind could reach unless heaven yeets down a higher truth.

he even had quirky pre-wedding ceremonies and dropped a humane flex that war should be fought by assassinating the enemy’s top dogs—paradox moves totally in line with some of plato's wild mind-benders. he imagined, in a charming twist a la the greeks and barbarians in the timaeus, that utopians picked up greek lingo mad quick because they were originally part of the same squad—a super meta heritage flex. soaked in plato spirit, he raked in quotes and ideas straight from both the republic and the timaeus, always preferring public duty over private chill and getting super impatient with clingy relationship spam. utopians didn’t hoard silver or gold; they were cool with paying their mercenaries when needed, and nothing got his contempt more than the love of money. gold got reworked as shackles for criminals, and diamonds and pearls turned into kid bling—like when ambassadors rolled in heavy with gold and peacock feathers, almost every utopian thought that flash was so extra it was downright shameful, saluting even the vilest peeps as lords while passing over the ambassadors, who were judged as nothing more than bondmen for their flashy golden chains. you should've seen the kids—chucking their own pearls aside and playfully shoving their moms, all like, "yo, even a little kid has more drip!" and the moms were like, "peace, son, i think that dude's one of the ambassadors' fools."

like plato, more was loaded with savage satire on governments and royal types, roasting the state of the world and knowledge like it was nothing. the hero of his saga, hythloday, was super anti-bureaucracy—totally unwilling to become a state minister because that would yeet his independence and have his epic advice fall on deaf ears (peep that mic-drop ending: "and verily it is naturally given... suppressed and ended"). he roasted the new logic game of his time; the utopians were so lost they couldn’t wrap their heads around the doctrine of second intentions—like, they never cooked up those slick rules about restrictions, amplifications, and suppositions that our kids learn nowadays. they couldn’t even pin down the second intentions; none of them could see "man" for what he is, even though he’s bigger than any giant we know, like, a fact you could poke with your finger.

he was hella severe about gentry sports too—the utopians even counted "hunting the lowest, vilest, and most abject parts of butchery" as totally off the charts. he even dropped a quote from the republic where the philosopher is described as "standing out of the way under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be overpast," a vibe that eerily mirrors more’s own fate—even though he penned that nearly twenty years back (around 1514), so he couldn’t have been a legit psychic.

nothing cuts deeper than his lowkey savage line that most of christ’s precepts totally clash with how ordinary christians live—more so than even his own utopia discourse. he basically says, "yet most of them are more dissident from the world's manners these days than my own drops were. but those preachers, sly and crafty dudes, taking your cue because they peeped how evil men wanted to shape their lives around christ’s rule, twisted his doctrine and applied it like a heavy lead rule on people’s behavior, just so they could all vibe together," – an epic roast, no cap.

now, the new atlantis is just a half-baked fragment, way less fire than utopia. it’s got some mad ingenuity but totally lacks that creative sparkle, leaving the reader with zero feels of credibility. in some spots, lord bacon stands out from sir thomas more—for example, when bacon drops detailed deets on the governor of solomon’s house and his over-the-top outfit, while more just sees all that extra dress as straight-up ridiculous. yet after that fashion flex, bacon adds the smooth trait that his look was like he genuinely pitied men, which is kinda beautiful. although bacon borrows bits from the timaeus, he wrecks the unified style by tossing in extra thoughts and passages from the hebrew scriptures, mashing styles in a way that just doesn’t vibe as one smooth masterpiece.

yo, check it – the ‘city of the sun’ dropped by campanella (1568-1639), a dominican friar, just a few years after bacon’s ‘new atlantis,’ is lowkey a twin of plato’s republic, no cap. the citizens are all about sharing bae and kiddos; their hookups are totally temporary vibes, arranged on the reg by the magistrates. but they ain’t buying that lottery-style system—instead, they squad up the dopest souls, both dudes and dudettes, strictly according to lit philosophical guidelines.

the tiny ones up to age two get raised by their moms in public temples – ‘cause, let’s be real, most peeps flunk the kid-schooling game. so at just three years old, the state swoops in to school them, not with dusty books, but with a gallery of wild paintings plastered on the city walls. speaking of which, the city flexes with six inner circuit walls plus an outer wall, making it seven overall. on that outer wall, they’ve got rad murals of lawmakers and brainy philosophers, while each inner wall drops icons for a different science—total academia drip, no cap.

the ladies ain’t just chillin’ either—they get the same savage training as the dudes in warlike drills and other boss moves—but they also hold two extra lit roles. after battle, they squad up with the boys to soothe and heal the wounded warriors, dishing out warm hugs and sweet words like true care package pros.

and yo, they keep some christian vibes in the mix. the squad is hella inspired by the apostles’ squad goals—everything shared to the max—and they rock that ultra-short prayer that jesus christ handed down. the chief magistrates got a major duty to pardon sins, so everyone drops their secret dirty deets to the magistrates, who then slide the info to the head honcho—a sorta rector metaphysicus—keeping him clued in on every mind’s DM. after the confession tea, absolution is served to the whole crew, with no individual callouts, and they even pull off a nonstop prayer hustle by switching priests every hour, like a never-ending insta live sesh.

their faith is all about worshipping god in trinity—that is, wisdom, love, and power—with zero person drama. they peep his glow in the sun and straight-up ghost carved idols, refusing to get clowned by the tyranny of idolatry.

they drop mad deets about their eating and drinking customs, drip style, gigs, and even their war moves. campanella is hyped for a fresh edu system focused on studying nature, not stuck on aristotle’s dusty scrolls. he’s like, “nah, don’t waste time on these dead signs of things.” he schools us by saying that if you only master one science, you’re just as clueless as everyone else—so, mix it up, fr. the city of the sun churns out more scholars in a single year than our current method does in a decade or two. he’s all in on the vibe, like bacon, that natural science is about to majorly takeover education—even if this dream’s been forever on ice.

this work’s bursting with creative energy and original flair, dripping with an ultra-enlightened spirit. ngl, its style is kinda meh, lacking the pizzazz of bacon’s ‘new atlantis’ or sir thomas more’s ‘utopia.’ it’s riddled with inconsistencies and, while it borrows from plato, it only vibes on a surface-level hookup with his writings. basically, it’s the kinda drop you’d expect from a philosopher-genius friar who spent like twenty-seven years in an inquisition dungeon. the dopest part, shared by both plato and sir thomas more, is how the writer goes super deep on the misery and cluelessness reppin’ the lowlife classes of his time.

campanella also calls out aristotle’s clapback to plato’s communal property idea—arguing that if everything’s shared, no one’s gonna hustle, as aristotle (pol.) warned. his savage reply: his citizens are hella happy and vibing (they only grind for four hours a day), so they’ll care more about each other than the normies do now. he’s sending the message that if you chop out all that selfish feels, an epic public vibe will slide in, just as plato dreamed.

other state-vibes writings—like harrington’s ‘oceana,’ where lord archon (read: cromwell) gets a glow-up makeover into who he should’ve been, or barclay’s ‘argenis,’ a historical allegory of his own time—are too off-brand compared to plato to even flex on. way more lit and platonic in style is sir john eliot’s ‘monarchy of man,’ where a tower-bound dude, no longer able to flex as a homegrown politicker, peels off from the game to scope out ‘that inner city,’ and right at the edge of the grave discovers that the secret sauce to human happiness is mastering your own self. the government shake-up during the english commonwealth got peeps rethinking first principles, sparking a tidal wave of these mind-bending works.

the savage genius of swift is totally original—he owes nada to plato; and dr. johnson? zero traces of plato in his chats and texts. swift would’ve dissed plato without even cracking open his work, just like how he claimed to’ve taken down bishop berkeley’s theory that matter is just a myth. aside from those so-called english platonists (more like neo-platonists who totally missed the memo) and coleridge, who sometimes vibed on the same wavelength, plato hasn’t left a lasting clout on english literature.

7. human life and conduct get hit with ideals like they’re epic influencer role models—just as much as they get lit by the examples of legendary peeps. neither the ideals nor the epic examples are plug-and-play for everyday life, but they drip major virtue that can level up an individual from the basic normie grind and even boost states above the petty hustle of commerce or plain ol’ self-defense. like art ideals, they’re half-built by leaving out too many deets; you gotta peep them from a chill distance, because if you get too up-close, they start to fade, ya feel? they score an unreal, dreamlike vibe when wrapped up in a state or a whole philosophy system, yet they still remain visions of “a world unrealized.” what hits harder, though, is the example set by the goats—those epic legends who slayed for their generation and left their mark for the next. even in your own fam, there might be someone—a queen, a king, or even a mini rockstar—whose aura is straight-up next level. that ideal then gets way closer, and you cling to it hard. the ideals of past times, whether from your own history or old-school societies, wield an irresistible charm for many. by the time we realize it, though, those vibes can’t be fully recaptured, even if soaking them in could level up future eras. but, real talk, most peeps find philosophy’s abstract flex to be cold and empty—it spits light with zero warmth, like a full moon in a starless sky. we can’t live on thoughts alone; the real sensory world keeps crashing our vibe. most folks are stuck in their own little corner, only peeping a bit beyond their crib—they don’t even lift their eyes to the hills, barely awake when dawn breaks. but with plato, we’re soaring high enough to scan the future of both the world and philosophy. the dream of a state and a philosopher’s lifestyle; the ideal of a life-long education that treats all genders equally; the unified, interlocked model of knowledge; that unwavering faith in pure good and immortality—these are the bare luminous forms on which plato is tryna lock humanity’s gaze.

8. two other ideals, which never even popped off in greek philosophy, are now cruising in our collective brainspace: one is way more visible now, like every year and every generation pulling us closer to a major glow-up; the other is almost ghosting behind nature’s strict laws, as if nature’s got it on lockdown, yet still hangs in there as a silent hope we can’t quite name, deep in our hearts. the first ideal is the future glow of the human race right here; the second is the individual’s future in another realm. the first is basically the ultimate upgrade of our current hustle; the second is like checking out of this world entirely—one’s capped by experience, while the other totally transcends it. both have been, and continue to be, massive drivers in our actions; some rare peeps even let them override all the mundane, earthly vibes. at first glance, the future hope for humanity seems hella selfless, while that of individual existence looks super egotistical—but when peeps learn to flip their hope for the future, whether it’s for themselves or the whole world, into god’s will (“not my will but thine”), the lines blur; either one can totally be your life’s core, depending on your personal drip and vibe. there’s as much fuel in hustling for an unseen future in this world as in another. and yo, it ain’t far-fetched that some rare soul might vibe with the duty to boost another generation or century just as hard as their own, or that by constantly chillin’ in god’s presence, they can peep another world as vividly as the one we live in.

the absolute dopest ideal must be envisioned through vibes lifted from our own human traits; although sometimes, like the jewish prophets, we scram fancy metaphors and only drop god’s deets in the negatives. but over time, those negatives level up into a full-on positive drip. it’d be lit if, when meditating on life’s higher truths—be it philosophy or religion—we switched up our expressions, so we don’t end up chained as slaves to basic, empty words.

there’s also a third vibe, not exactly the same but in the same ballpark, that every believer in christ’s religion holds close in their heart and home—the divine man, the son of man, the ultimate savior of mankind. he’s like the firstborn and head honcho of the entire fam in both heaven and earth, where his divine and human sides, that which’s beyond our earthly scope and that which is right in our feels, fuse into one indissoluble unit. this god-tier goodness isn’t separate from the christian church ideal—which the new testament calls “his body”—and it ain’t at odds with the other good vibes that plato drops. we only peep him as a symbol, and we choose only the simplest, most basic flex sayings to represent him. we see his image in a pic, but yo, he isn’t literally there; we scoop up fragments of his speeches, yet they never capture his true essence. his crib isn’t in heaven or on earth—it’s in the heart of every human. this is the image that plato peeped in the distance—a vibe he called, borrowing from homer, “the likeness of god” – the likeness of a nature that, in every era, peeps have felt was way above and better than themselves, and which, in endless forms (whether derived from scripture or nature, history’s tea or straight out of the heart), be it seen as a person or not, with or without the whole extra, in space or out, remains and will always continue to be mankind’s ultimate idea of good.

persons of the dialogue.

socrates, who is the narrator.
glaucon.
adeimantus.
polemarchus.
cephalus.
thrasymachus.
cleitophon.
and others who are mute auditors.

the scene is set in cephalus’ pad at the piraeus; and the whole dialogue gets recapped by socrates the very next day to timaeus, hermocrates, critias, and some nameless homie introduced in the timaeus.

book i.

yo, so yesterday i dipped to the piraeus with glaucon, son of ariston, to throw up some prayers to the goddess (bendis, aka the thracian artemis, for real) and also to peep how they’d level up the new festival vibes. i was hype about the lit procession of the locals—even though the thracian squad’s parade was even more extra. once we wrapped up our sacred vibes and soaked in the visual drip, we turned toward the city; and then, outta nowhere, polemarchus—the son of cephalus—peeped us from afar as we were about to bounce home, and hollered to his sidekick to sprint over and say, “hang on, yo, polemarchus wants you to chill a bit.”

i spun around and asked, “where’s your boss at?”

the kid was like, “there he is, trailing behind—just chill and wait up.”

glaucon was like, “bet, we gotchu,” and a few mins later, polemarchus showed up with adeimantus (glaucon’s bro), niceratus (son of nicias), and a bunch of peeps from the procession.

polemarchus shot one at me: “socrates, i peep that you and your crew are already cruisin’ towards the city.”

i was like, “facts, you ain’t too off, my dude.”

but he clapped back, “yo, can you peep how many squad members there are?”

i was like, “ofc.”

then he asked, “are you strong enough to handle all these peeps? cuz if not, you’d have to stay put.”

i fired back, “can’t we just slide by and convince you to let us scoot?”

he snapped, “like, can you even hype us up if we ain’t vibing with your talk?”

glaucon piped in, “facts, definitely not.”

so, we’re not gonna listen to this, trust that.

adeimantus then added, “yo, haven’t you heard about the torch race on horseback in honor of the goddess that’s dropping tonight?”

i was like, “with horses?! fr, that’s wild. so these riders toss torches around mid-race?”

polemarchus confirmed, “yup, and not only that—but there’s a nighttime festival coming up that you gotta peep. after we grub, let’s bounce and soak in the festival vibes; there’ll be a crew of young blood for a dope chat. so, stick around and don’t be extra stubborn, aight?”

glaucon was like, “guess since you’re insistin’, we gotta roll with it.”

i hit back, “cool, cool, bet.”

so, we dipped with polemarchus to his crib, and there we bumped into his bros lysias and euthydemus, plus thrasymachus from chalcedon, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon (son of aristonymus). also, cephalus—polemarchus’ old man—was there, and damn, i hadn’t seen him in ages; he looked mad ancient. he was chilling on a cushy chair, rocking a garland on his head ‘cause he’d just been sacrificing in the court; a few other chairs were set up in a chill semicircle, and we scooted down next to him. he greeted me with mad hype, then dropped this:

“yo, socrates, you don’t hit up my pad as often as you should. if i could still roll up to see you on my own, i wouldn’t bug you to come here. but now, at my age, i can barely roll to the city, so you better slide into the piraeus more often. real talk: as my body’s pleasures fade, the charm and vibe of a good convo only get sweeter. so don’t ghost my invite—make my crib your go-to chill spot and kick it with these young homies; we’re old friends, and you’ll feel totally at home.”

i shot back, “cephalus, nothing beats kicking it with seasoned peeps—I see y’all as travelers on a journey i might someday be on, so i gotta ask: was the road smooth or mad rocky? basically, i wanna know if life’s a breezy cruise or an epic struggle.”

“alright, socrates,” he said, “lemme drop my two cents. peeps my age squad up together—birds of a feather, y’know—and when we vibe, the usual saga is: i can’t chow down, can’t sip right; all the lit perks of youth and romance are ghosted. back in the day, times were dope, but now it’s like, over. life just ain’t life anymore. some folks be whining about fam disses, blaming old age for all their probs. but for me, socrates, these whiners be blaming the wrong vibe. if old age was the real tea, then i and every old-timer would be on that same struggle. but that ain’t how i roll, nor have my homies. i still remember sophocles—the legendary old poet—when someone asked him, ‘yo, how does love vibe with age? still the same you?’ and he answered, ‘peace’—like, i’m stoked to have dodged that wild ride; i felt like i escaped from a raging, mad boss. his words still hit hard, as fresh now as back then. for real, old age brings major chill and freedom; when all that extra drama fades, as sophocles said, we’re freed from not just one crazy boss, but a whole squad. the truth, socrates, is that these moans and fam beef aren’t really caused by old age—they come from our own characters and temperaments. a peep with a calm, happy vibe barely feels the weight of age, but if you’re on the opposite trip, both youth and old age hit like a heavy burden.”

i sat there, super impressed and prodding him for more—so i said, “cephalus, i kinda suspect most peeps aren’t buying your vibe when you drop that wisdom; they figure your chill old age isn’t ‘cause you’re mellow, but ‘cause you got mad coin—and we all know cash is a killer comforter.”

“true dat,” cephalus replied, “they aren’t convinced—and there’s some truth in their clapbacks, just not as drastic as they think. i could drop one like themmistocles did to that seriphian hater who said i was only famous ‘cause i was an athenian: ‘if you were from my hood or i from yours, neither of us would be famous.’ same goes for those poor souls who gripe about old age; for a good poor dude, old age isn’t a lightweight, and a shady rich guy can never find real peace.”

so, i asked, “cephalus, can i ask: was your bag mostly inherited or did you hustle it out yourself?”

“acquired, for sure, socrates! ya dig? wanna know how much i raked in? in the money game, i’m right in the middle between my dad and granddad. my granddad—i even rock his name—doubled and trebled his stash (what he inherited is basically what i got now), but my dad, lysanias, kinda whittled it down to less than it is today. i’d be stoked if i can leave my sons not just what i got, but even a little extra over what i inherited.”

yo, that's exactly why i hit you with that question, i replied, cuz i peep that you're totally chill about cash – which, fr fr, is more typical of peeps who inherited their stacks rather than hustled for them; the money-makers are lowkey in a second-level crush with coin, like they stan their own bangers or how parents hype up their kids, on top of that natural love for cash for the flex and profit that all humans get. so, no cap, they're pretty much a one-track squad, only yapping about mad props for wealth.

facts, he said.

bet, that's so true, but can i hit you with another q? what's the absolute best blessing you copped from your coin stash?

one, he said, that i probably wouldn't have an easy time convincing others about. cuz listen up, socrates, when a dude thinks his time is almost up, all sorts of cray fears and dramas start poppin' off in his brain – stuff he never ever felt before; those ghost stories about a chill world below and the payback for our here-and-now moves used to be nothing but a lame meme, but now he’s straight up shook, wondering if they’re for real. whether it’s the whole aging vibe or just 'cause he’s cruisin’ closer to that next realm, he starts peepin' these things way clearer; suspicions and intense alarms flood his mind, and he starts reppin' over every bad move he dissed on others. and when he sees that his total screw-ups are mad high, he’ll, like a little kid, jump outta bed in the middle of sleep from fear, all drenched in dark, heavy vibes. but for a dude who feels zero guilt, sweet hope – as our boi pindar drops so charmingly – is like the ultimate hype nurse for his life's playlist:

  "hope cherishes the soul of a homie who lives straight up in justice and holiness, and is, like, the ride-or-die for his years and the squad on his journey; hope is the real mvp flex that can sway even the most restless soul of man."

omg, his words are straight-up fire! and check it, the dopest blessing of having mad stacks – and i'm not dissing any normie, but a legit good guy – is that he never had to go beast mode on anyone by schemin' or scamming them, whether on purpose or by accident; and when he taps out to the big beyond, he ain't stressin' about dropping offerings to the gods or owing any debt to the squad. like, that peace-of-mind vibe is majorly boosted by having cash, so, when you line up all the perks wealth can drop, for a wise homie, this is, in my honest opinion, the top flex.

facts, cephalus, i replied; but when we talk about justice, what’s the real tea? is it just keeping it 100 and paying up your debts—that’s it? and even that, aren’t there some twisty exceptions? like, say a homeboy, when he was solid, stashed his arms with me, and later, when he’s totally off his game, asks for them back—should i just straight up return them? nobody’s gonna hype that as the right move, any more than they'd say i should always be spewing truth to someone who’s way off their vibes.

facts, you're mad right, he replied.

but yo, i said, spitting truth and paying your debts ain't the full 411 on what justice really is.

true that, socrates, if simonides is what we’re vibin' with, chimed in polemarchus.

yo, i gotta bounce, said cephalus, 'cuz i gotta keep an eye on the sacrificial ritual vibes, so i'm droppin' the debate mic to polemarchus and the rest of the crew.

ain't polemarchus like your main successor? i asked.

aye, for sure, he answered, and dipped off laughing as he rolled toward the sacrifices.

spill the tea then, oh heir to this debate—what did simonides drop, and what do you honestly think he meant about justice?

he dropped that paying back your debts is just, and honestly, that vibe seems solid to me.

i’d be mad sorry to doubt the word of such a legendary, lit dude, but his drip, though probably crystal for you, is total static for me. cuz he definitely wasn’t saying that i should just hand back a stashed set of arms – or any other deposit – when someone’s off their game; yet a deposit is still, facts, a debt.

facts.

so when the homie who asks me is totally outta it, i'm not supposed to yeet the stash back, right?

definitely not.

so, when simonides said that payin' your debts was justice, he wasn’t including that off-the-rails case, right?

definitely not; cuz he’s all about that friend vibe – a real homeboy always does good for another homeboy and never goes out to roast them.

so, you're sayin' that if a friend gets back a deposit of gold that ends up hurting them, it ain't really payin' back the debt—that’s the vibe you'd expect him to drop?

yep.

and enemies, too, gotta get what we owe them?

for sure, he said, they should get what’s due; and like, an enemy, in my eyes, owes an enemy whatever is proper to them—in other words, bad juju.

so, simonides, channeling those poetic dark vibes, was basically saying that justice means giving each homie what’s rightful for them, and he called that a debt.

bet that's what he meant, he said.

no cap, i replied; and if we asked him what proper drop is given by medicine, and to whom, what do you reckon he'd say?

for sure, he’d say that medicine drops drugs, grub, and bevvies to human bodies.

and what proper drop does cookery deliver, and to who?

seasoning, bro – that’s the flavor for food.

so then, what does justice drop, and on who?

if, socrates, we vibe with the earlier analogies, then justice is that art that doles out good vibes to friends and low-key bad ones to enemies.

so, that’s his flex then?

i think so, fr.

and who’s best at boosting his squad’s vibes and dissing his haters even when they're down or sick?

the physician, obviously.

or, like, when they’re out cruising the wild seas, dodging all kinds of peril?

the pilot, no doubt.

but in which clutch moves, or aiming for what end, is the just dude most lit at dropping good on his friends and clapping back on his enemies?

by goin’ to war against one side and squad'ing up with the other.

but if a dude is all good and on point, my dear polemarchus, why would he need a physician?

nah.

and if you're not on a wild sea cruise, why call in a pilot?

nah.

so in chill, peace-out times, justice is basically just meh, right?

i’m way off that idea.

so you reckon justice can flex in both peace and battle?

facts.

like farming for that golden corn?

yep.

or like cobbling up fresh kicks for your drip—that what you're sayin'?

yep.

so, what similar clutch flex does justice have in peace mode?

in sealin’ the deal with contracts, socrates – justice is hella useful.

and by contracts, you mean those tight partnerships?

exactly.

but, between a righteous homie and a mad skilled draughts player, who would be the better squadmate in a game?

the skilled player, no cap.

and when it comes to stackin' bricks and stones, is the just dude a better partner than the builder?

nah, it's totally the other way around.

so in what kind of squad-up does the just dude outshine even a baller harpist—since when jammin' on a harp, the legit harp-player totally surpasses a guy who’s just about justice?

in a money collab, obviously.

yeah, polemarchus, but surely not in actual money moves; cuz you wouldn't want a justice nerd advising on buying or selling a horse—a dude who actually knows horses would come in clutch, right?

certainly.

and if you're tryna grab a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be the go-to?

true.

so, what’s that joint play with silver or gold where the just dude is actually the preferred partner?

when you need a deposit to be locked down safe.

you mean when money’s just chillin’, not actively in play?

precisely.

in other words, justice is clutch when your cash is just sitting useless.

that's the vibe.

and if you wanna keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice’s role is lit for both the individual and the state; but when it comes to actually usin' it, you gotta roll with the vine-dresser’s art, ya dig?

straight up.

and when you wanna stash a shield or a lyre rather than use 'em, then justice is the move; but if you're tryna flex 'em in action, then it's all about the soldier or the musician’s craft.

certainly.

so basically, for all these other things too—justice is useful when stuff is on chill mode, and kinda useless when that stuff is in full flex.

that's the takeaway.

so, justice ain't exactly a boss in practicality. but check this: isn't the dude who lands the sickest punch in a brawl or any fight the one best at blocking one back?

certainly.

and is the homie who's mad skilled at dodgin' or bouncing off a sickness also, like, the MVP when it comes to sparking one up?

for real.

and the ultimate camp guard is the one who can, like, stealthily outmaneuver the enemy?

certainly.

so basically, if you're dope at keepin' your stuff secure, you're also slick enough to jack it, right?

yup, that's the takeaway.

so, lowkey, if the just dude's lit at hoardin' cash, he's also, by that logic, mad skilled at snatching it.

that's exactly the inference.

so, turns out, the so-called just dude is, in the end, pretty much a thief. and this is a lesson i bet you picked up from homer; cuz he, when talkin' about autolycus – odysseus's maternal granddude and a total fav of his – drops that line:

  "he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury."

so, you, homer, and simonides are all vibin' that justice is just an artful hustle of thievery; meant, like, to be practiced "for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies"—is that what you were droppin'?

nah, certainly not that, even tho i can't exactly recall what i said before; but i'm still stickin' with that latter vibe.

but yo, here's another q: by "friends" and "enemies," are we talkin' about peeps who are, like, genuinely solid or just frontin' that vibe?

for sure, he said, you’d expect a dude to stan those he sees as good, and to roast those he pegs as trash.

true, but humans are lowkey confused about what's good and what's evil: a bunch of folks who ain't truly good might seem that way, and vice versa.

facts.

so then, might our squad accidentally end up callin' the good haters and the evil ride-or-die peeps?

true.

and then they'd be, like, droppin' good vibes on the baddies and dishing out bad juju to the good? obviously.

but the real ones, the good peeps, are straight-up just and wouldn't go out causin' harm.

true.

so, by your logic, is it justice to clap back on peeps who haven't done any wrong?

nah, socrates; that line of thought is straight-up immoral.

so, i guess we should be, like, boostin' the righteous and dissing the wicked, right?

i vibe with that, for real.

but peep the burn: plenty of dudes who don’t really get human nature end up with friends who are actually toxic – meaning they'd deserve a roast; and they might have enemies who are secretly gems, so they deserve props; but if that's the case, we'd be spittin' something totally opposite to the vibe simonides set.

big facts, he said: and i reckon we gotta fix this mix-up in how we're usin' "friend" and "enemy."

so, what's the glitch, polemarchus? i asked.

we kinda assumed that a friend is someone who appears or is thought to be good.

so, how do we remix this error?

we should say that a true friend is someone who is actually good as well as looks good; and if someone is only puttin' on a good face but ain't really good, then they ain't a friend at all; and the same goes for enemies.

so you're sayin' that the good are our ride-or-die crew and the bad are our haters?

yeah.

and instead of just sayin' that it's justice to do good for our friends and harm our enemies, we should drop it as: it's just to do good for our friends when they're actually good and to dis our enemies when they're truly evil.

yeah, that vibe sounds hella legit to me.

but should the righteous ever drop harmful blows on anyone at all?

no doubt, they should hit up only those who are both shady and their confirmed haters.

when a horse gets clapped, does it glow up or get wrecked?

definitely, it gets wrecked.

like, the horse loses its on-point qualities, not like a dog, right?

yep, of horses.

and dogs, too, lose their inherent doggo vibes when hurt, not horse vibes?

of course.

and won't humans who get injured lose that core human drip—the virtue that makes them who they are?

certainly.

and that core human drip is justice, right?

for sure.

then, if dudes get hurt, they're, like, inevitably made less just?

that's the take.

but can a musician, just by droppin' beats, make folks lose their musical vibe?

def not.

or can a rider, just by flexin' his craft, turn someone into a bad horseman?

impossible.

and can a righteous dude, by simply being righteous, flip someone into injustice—or more generally, can pure good vibes turn a person bad?

absolutely not.

any more than heat can just spawn cold, right?

it totally cannot.

or like, trigger moisture during a drought?

clearly not.

nor can the good ever truly harm anyone.

impossible.

and the just is basically the good, right?

for sure.

so droppin' harm on a friend or anyone else isn’t the move of a just dude—it’s what the unjust do.

i feel that up to the highest degree, socrates.

so if a dude claims that justice is merely payback on debts, and that good is the debt a just dude owes his friends while evil is what he owes his haters—droppin' that ain't smart; cuz, as we've shown, harming someone is never just, no matter how u spin it.

i agree with you, said polemarchus.

so, you and i are ready to throw down on anyone who tries to flex that line from simonides, bias, pittacus, or any of those so-called wise OGs or prophets?

i'm hella ready to squad up and battle on your side, he said.

should i spill whose vibe i think actually started that line?

who, tho?

i reckon that either periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban, or some other mega-rich, flexin' dude with crazy self-love, was the first to drop that justice line: "doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies."

preach, he said.

yep, i said; but if this justice definition also gets wrecked, what alternative roll-up can we serve?

in the heat of the debate, thrasymachus tried several times to hijack the convo for his own drip, but the squad shut him down, dying to hear the finale. but once polemarchus and i were done spitting and things went quiet, he totally lost his chill; gathering all his wild beast energy, he charged at us like a savage tryna snatch us up. we were, like, totally shook, panic-mode activated.

he bellowed to the whole crew: "what crazy biz, socrates, has gotten into you all? and why, you damn goofy peeps, are you brawling among yourselves? i mean, if you truly wanna know what justice is, you shouldn’t just ask—you gotta drop your own answer too, and stop chasing clout by solely tearing off an opponent's argument; there are mad peeps who can ask without being able to answer. and i ain't down for you saying justice is just duty, profit, gain, or interest, cuz that weak sauce won't fly with me—I need clarity and real talk."

i was legit terrified by his rant, shaking so hard i could barely peep him without trembling. honestly, i swear if i hadn’t fixed my eyes on him, i would've been totally struck dumb; but once i saw his fury rising, i braced up and managed to hit him back.

thrasymachus, i stuttered, please don’t roast us too hard. polemarchus and i might've slipped up a bit in our debate, but trust that it wasn’t on purpose. like, if we were out there hunting for gold, you wouldn’t think we were trippin’ over one another and blowing our chance to snag it. so why, when chasing justice – which is way more precious than piles of gold – do you say we're weakly yielding to each other instead of going all out for the truth? no, my dude, we’re hella willing and hyped to get it, but sometimes the vibe just escapes us. so, if that’s the case, you wise peeps should cut us some slack instead of getting mad.

classic socrates, he shot back with a bitter chuckle; "yo, that's just your ironic flex! did i not call it out—did i not warn you that whoever is asked something will always dodge the real answer by using irony or some other shuffle to avoid actually answering?"

you're a philosopher, thrasymachus, i replied, and you know if you ask someone what combo of numbers makes twelve—and you strictly ban them from answering "two times six," "three times four," "six times two," or "four times three," because you say, 'this kind of nonsense won’t cut it for me'—then obviously, if that's your way of setting the question, no one can nail an answer. but imagine if they shot back, "thrasymachus, what do you mean? if one of these banned answers is actually the correct flex, am i screwed for dropping another number that's off?—is that what you're sayin'?"—what would your comeback be?

like, as if these two scenarios were even in the same league! he replied.

why not? i asked; and even if they're not truly identical, but just seem that way to the one gettin' asked, shouldn't he just spit his own thoughts regardless of whether you and i try to shut him down?

so, i guess you're gonna drop one of those banned answers?

i dare say i might – even if it's risky – if, after some deep thought, one of them vibes with me.

but what if i hit you with a justice answer that's next-level and better than any of those? he said, then what do you reckon you deserve to have done to you?

done to me! – like, as any clueless dude should learn from a wise one—that's the vibe i reckon i deserve.

what, and like, no cash out? that's an epic notion!

i'll pay when my wallet's flush, i replied.

but dude, you, socrates, as glaucon already said—and you, thrasymachus, shouldn't sweat cash either, cuz we're all gonna chip in for socrates.

yep, he replied, and then socrates will do his usual move—refusing to drop a straight answer himself, but going all out to tear apart someone else's answer.

bro, i said, how can anyone who claims to know stuff, and even if they've got some hazy ideas, be shut down by a so-called authority from spittin' them? naturally, the speaker should be someone like you who not only claims to know but can actually spill the tea. so, please, enlighten the squad and me, fam.

glaucon and the rest of the crew jumped in on my ask, and thrasymachus, as anyone could see, was lowkey hyped to speak – he thought his answer was fire and would let him shine. but at first, he played it off insisting i should answer; eventually, he relented and started. "check it," he said, "the genius of socrates: he doesn't school himself, but goes around learning from others—without even dropping a 'thank you.'"

i replied, "yeah, it's true i learn from others; but saying i'm ungrateful? that's straight-up bogus. i got zero cash, so i pay in praise, which is honestly all i've got; and trust, i'm always ready to hype anyone who spits real fire—you'll see when you answer, cuz i expect you to slam a killer response."

listen up, then, he declared; "i proclaim that justice is nothing but the interest of the stronger. so now, why don't you give me props? but of course, you won't."

"let me break it down," i replied. "justice, as you say, is the interest of the stronger. so, thrasymachus, what exactly do you mean by that? you ain't tryin' to say that, just because polydamas—the ultimate pancratiast—is stronger than us and finds beef perfect for boosting his strength, that eating beef is automatically good for us weaklings and, like, totally just for us, right?"

that's straight-up trash, socrates; you’re twisting words in the most damaging way for the argument.

not at all, my good sir, i said; i'm just tryna get your drift and wish you'd drop some clearer deets.

"well," he said, "haven't you peeped that there are diff types of government out there; like, tyrannies, democracies, and aristocracies?"

yup, i know.

and, like, the government is the main ruling force in each state, right?

for sure.

and yo, check it: different types of gov – whether they’re democratic, aristocratic, or straight-up tyrannical – drop laws that are all about boosting their own clout; these laws, crafted just to hype up their own agenda, are the “justice” they serve to their squad, and anyone who steps outta line gets yeeted as a lawbreaker and called totally unjust. that's what i mean when i say that in every state, the vibe of justice is the same – it’s all just the gov’s own hustle; and since the gov’s gotta be all about that power, the only logical flex is that everywhere, justice is really just the interest of the stronger. no cap.

aight, i got you, i said; and whether you’re on point or not, i'm gonna dive in. but gotta drop this tea: in your definition of justice, you peeped the word “interest” – even though you told me not to drop it – except you sneaked in “of the stronger” on top.

a small add-on, you gotta admit, he said.

big or small, who cares – first, we gotta see if what you're saying is the real tea. now we both vibe that justice is some kinda interest, but then you add “of the stronger”; and honestly, i'm not 100 on that extra drop, so i gotta look a lil deeper.

proceed.

i will; first off, tell me—do you vibe that it’s legit for subjects to obey their rulers?

i do.

but check it: are state rulers totally flawless, or do they sometimes mess up?

for real, he replied, they def slip up.

so when they craft their laws, sometimes they nail it, and sometimes they totally clown?

true.

when they’re on point, their laws vibe with their own interests; but when they’re off, they end up with laws that go against their own hustle—you feel me?

yes.

and these laws have to be followed by their peeps—and that's what you call justice?

no cap.

so then, by your logic, justice isn’t just about the subjects riding the wave for the stronger’s gains, but also, like, the flip side?

what are you even sayin? he asked.

i'm just rehashing your own words, i believe. but check this: haven’t we already agreed that rulers can be off on what they think their own interest is when they drop orders, and yet obeying them is still called justice? that was already a given, right?

yes.

then you gotta admit that justice isn’t really about serving the stronger’s interest when rulers accidentally order stuff that actually hurts them. cuz if, as you say, justice is just the subjects doing what they're told, then oh wisest of men, can we dodge the truth that the weak end up forced to do not what benefits the stronger, but what harms the stronger?

nothing’s clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.

yeah, said cleitophon, jumping in, if you want me as witness.

but no cap, no witness needed, said polemarchus, 'cause thrasymachus already admitted that rulers sometimes drop orders that don't even boost their own game, and yet following them is still called justice.

yeah, polemarchus—thrasymachus said that subjects doing what their rulers dictate is justice.

yeah, cleitophon, but he also slid that justice equals the stronger’s interest, and while confessing both moves, he also admitted that the stronger might order the weaker to do stuff that isn’t even in his favor; hence, justice ends up being about the injury just as much as it’s about the gains for the stronger.

but, cleitophon said, what he meant by the stronger’s “interest” was just what the stronger thought was his own flex—that’s what the weak had to handle; and he crowned that as justice.

that’s not exactly what he said, shot back polemarchus.

nm, i replied, if he’s now saying that, let’s just roll with it. tell me, thrasymachus, did you really mean by justice what the stronger thinks is his interest, whether that’s on point or just a cap?

certainly not, he said. do you really think that i call a dude who’s off his game “the stronger” just 'cause he’s mistaken?

yep, i said, i got the vibe that you did that when you admitted that rulers aren’t infallible and can totally mess up.

you be arguing like a snitch, socrates. are you saying, for example, that a doc who misdiagnoses isn’t really a doc while he’s tripping? or that someone who flops in math or grammar is still tagged as a math whiz or wordsmith at the time of the goof, with the mistake just being a slip? true, we say that the doc or the math whiz made a mistake, but that’s just how we chat; the real tea is that no legit grammarian or expert ever messes up while they’re truly dope at what they do—they only slip when their game is off, and then they ain’t that skilled no more. no true artist, sage, or ruler slips up while they’re fully in their role; even if folks be saying they do, that's just common talk. but for the sake of mad accuracy—since you’re all about that detail—we should say that a ruler, as long as he’s in ruler mode, is unerring, and being unerring, always drops commands that serve his own clout; and his subjects are obliged to follow. so, like i said from the jump, justice is the interest of the stronger.

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i seriously come off as that snitch, huh?

certainly, he replied.

and you think i'm tossing these questions just to roast you in this debate?

nah, he replied, ‘suppose’ isn’t the right word—I know it; but you’re gonna get clapped, and with just your arguments, you’ll never come out on top.

i ain't tryna go there, my dear man; but to keep it 100 for the future, lemme ask: when you talk about a ruler or the stronger—whose interest, as you dropped, is so thought to be their own flex that the weaker must follow—is that a ruler in the everyday, popular sense or in the strictly legit sense?

in the strictest sense possible, he said. and now, go ahead and play that snitch game if you wanna; i’m not asking for mercy. but trust, you’ll never ever pull it off.

and you really think, i said, that i'm such a lunatic as to try and hustle a cheat, thrasymachus? that’d be like trying to shave a lion, fr fr.

why, he said, you already tried it like a minute ago and flopped.

alright, enough of this pleasantry, i said. let’s cut to the chase: is the true physician—a real one in that strict sense—a healer of the sick or just a coin-chaser?

a healer of the sick, he replied.

and what about the pilot—that is, the real pilot—is he the captain of his sailors or just riding shotgun as a regular sailor?

a captain of sailors.

the fact that he’s on the ship doesn’t count; he’s not just a sailor. the title “pilot” is all about his mad skills and his boss-level authority over the crew.

facts, he said.

now, i said, every art has its own vibe or interest, right?

certainly.

for which it’s gotta scope out and deliver?

yes, that’s the whole aim of art.

and the point of any art is to be perfect—nothing more, nothing less?

what do you mean?

i mean, peep this negative example using the body. if you asked me whether the body can handle itself or if it’s got needs, i’d say: for sure, the body has needs; it can get sick and need fixing, and that’s exactly why the art of medicine is in the game—it’s there to serve the body’s interests, as you'd agree. right?

quite right, he replied.

but then, is the art of medicine—or any art for that matter—guilty of being buggy or missing something, like how an eye might not see well or an ear might not catch sound, and therefore need another art to step in? in other words, is any art prone to glitches that require extra fixes over and over, or do arts only worry about their own subject’s vibe? or are they straight-up flawless, with no need for any extra patch-up, since they’re perfect as long as they stick to what they’re about? using your super precise terms, tell me—am i right?

yes, clearly.

then medicine isn’t looking out for its own bag, but for the body’s vibe, right?

true, he said.

and same with, say, horsemanship—it’s not about the art itself but about what’s best for the horse; no art cares for itself 'cause they got no needs—they only serve what their subject requires.

true, he said.

but surely, thrasymachus, aren’t the arts like total bosses over their own subjects?

he agreed, but with a serious hint of hesitation.

then, i said, no science or art is out here hyping up the stronger's own gains; they’re only about boosting the subject’s vibe, the weaker ones.

he tried to argue back a bit, but eventually chilled and agreed.

then, i continued, no real physician, while in doc mode, is out here thinking about his own profit when prescribing—they’re all about the patient’s good; after all, the true doc is like a ruler with the human body as his domain, not some coin-flipping hustle; we’re on the same page, yeah?

yes.

and the pilot too, in the strict sense, is the boss of the sailors—not just another sailor on deck?

that was agreed.

and such a pilot, as the ruler, dishes out orders that serve the sailors’ vibe, not his own or the boss’s profit?

he muttered a reluctant “yes.”

then, i said, thrasymachus, no ruler—while in full ruler mode—cares about boosting his own bag; he’s always laser-focused on what’s best for his subjects or what works for his art. that’s the only thing he ever considers in all his moves.

at this point in the debate, when everyone peeped that the whole definition of justice was totally flipped on its head, thrasymachus, instead of clapping back, hit me with: “tell me, socrates, you got a nurse?”

why you droppin’ that question, i said, when you should be spitting your own bars?

'cause she lets you snivel and never even wipes your nose—she didn’t even school you on who’s the real shepherd and who’s just a sheep.

what makes you say that? i replied.

'cause you’re tripping thinking that a shepherd fattens up his sheep or oxen for their own good—like he’s at some fancy dinner or chowing down at a banquet, or even hustling as a trader on the market—instead of actually looking out for his own boss vibes; and you even imagine that true state rulers never see their subjects as sheep, always scheming for their own gain day and night. nah fam; you’re so off-base about what’s just and unjust that you don’t even realize justice and the just are really all about someone else’s gain—that is, the ruler’s interest and the loss for the subject, while injustice is the flip side. the unjust boss gets all the clout over the genuinely simple and just crew: he’s the stronger, and his subjects do what perks up his hustle and serve his happiness, which is mad far from being their own. think on it, most foolish socrates—the just always end up taking an L compared to the unjust. first, in private deals: whenever a just person teams up with an unjust one, when the partnership breaks, the unjust dude always walks away with more, and the just gets played. second, when dealing with the state: with income tax, the just pays way more and the unjust way less on the same stack; and when there’s any loot to be had, the unjust pockets big while the just comes up empty. also peep what happens when they step into office: the just man ends up neglecting his own grind, maybe suffers extra losses, and gets zilch from the public ‘cause he’s too busy being honest; plus, his mates roast him for refusing to serve them through shady means. but flip that script for the unjust man. i’m talking big-scale injustice here where the upside for the unjust is crystal clear; and it hits hardest when we peep the highest form of injustice—where the criminal is living his best life and the ones who stick to being just end up totally miserable—that’s tyranny, where by straight-up fraud and force, he rakes off everyone else’s property, not little by little but on the down-low wholesale; scooping up the sacred with the profane, the private with the public; for if he got caught doing any one of these moves solo, he’d get smashed with punishment and mad disgrace—those solo wrongdoers get tagged as temple robbers, man-stealers, burglars, swindlers, and thieves. but when a dude goes all out—snatching cash and even turning citizens into slaves—then instead of getting roasted with those names, he’s hailed as happy and blessed by not only his own people but by everyone who hears he maximized injustice. 'cause people call out injustice not just ‘cause they’re too woke to do it themselves, but ‘cause they’re scared they might get hit next. so, as i’ve been droppin, socrates, when injustice runs on a big scale, it’s got mad strength, freedom, and control compared to justice; and like i said from the start, justice is just the interest of the stronger, while injustice is all about a man’s own profit and hustle.

after dropping that massive bath-man flow, thrasymachus was lowkey about to dip. but the squad wasn’t having it—they insisted he stay and defend his stance; and i even threw in my humble ask for him to stick around. “yo, thrasymachus,” i said, “your points are hella suggestive! you really gonna bounce before schooling us on whether they’re legit or not? is figuring out how we all level up in life such a minor side hustle for you?”

and do i seem any different from you on how important this deep dive is? he said.

you honestly seem like you couldn’t give a damn about us, thrasymachus—whether we live better or worse ‘cause of not knowing what you claim to know is all just blah to you. come on, friend, don’t keep your wisdom locked up; we’re a whole squad, and any glow-up you drop on us will get mad props. as for me, i’m out here saying i’m not convinced, and i don’t think injustice is more profitable than justice—even if you let it run wild. even if there’s some unjust dude out here pulling shady moves by fraud or brute force, that still doesn’t convince me that injustice is the superior flex, and maybe others are feeling the same. maybe we’re off; if that’s the tea, drop your wisdom and show us we’re wrong about preferring justice over injustice.

and how am i supposed to convince you, he said, if you’re not already shook by what i just dropped? what else can i do? you want me to implant the proof straight into your soul?

heaven forbid! i said; i’m just asking you to keep it consistent—if you switch up, do it out in the open, no shady vibes. i gotta note, thrasymachus, if you remember what you dropped earlier: even though you started by defining the true physician in a super exact way, you totally lost that precision when talking about the shepherd; you were trippin’ thinking that a shepherd, in his role, tends the sheep not for their own good but like he’s feasting at a banquet or hustling as a market trader, instead of being a real shepherd. but for real, the art of the shepherd is only about the good of his crew; he just has to serve the best for them, since an art is already on lock once all its boxes are ticked. and that’s what i was saying about the ruler too. i figured the art of ruling—whether in a state or in private life—should only be about the good of his flock, while you seem to think that state rulers—the true bosses—are all about flexing their own authority.

think! nah, i’m mad sure of it.

then why is it that for lesser gigs, no one’s tryna take ’em without getting paid, unless they believe they're governing for the squad’s gain and not just for themselves? lemme ask: aren’t the different arts, by nature, all about their own separate functions? and, my illustrious friend, spit your truth so we can actually make some progress.

yes, that’s the diff, he replied.

and each art drops its own special perk and not just a general vibe—medicine, for instance, gives you health; navigation gives you safe waves at sea, and so on?

yes, he said.

and the art of payment has the unique job of dishing out cash—but don’t get it twisted with other arts, just like the art of the pilot isn’t the same as the art of medicine, even if a sea trip might boost a pilot’s health. you wouldn’t say that navigation equals medicine, right, if we gotta stick to your exact words?

certainly not.

nor would you say that because a dude's vibing in good health after getting paid, that the art of payment is medicine?

i wouldn’t.

and you feel that the benefit of each art is locked to that art alone?

yes.

then, if there’s any perk all artists share, it’s gotta come from something they all use in common?

true, he replied.

and when an artist benefits by getting paid, that extra boost comes from the separate art of payment, which isn’t actually his main craft?

he grumbled a reluctant “yes.”

so, the cash flow isn’t derived directly from each artist’s own art. the real tea is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of building drops a crib, there’s always that extra art of pay in the mix. each art does its own thing and boosts its own subject, but would an artist even gain any clout from his craft unless he also got paid?

i suppose not.

but does that mean he drops zero benefit when he works for free?

definitely, he still drops benefits.

now, thrasymachus, there’s zero doubt: neither arts nor governments are in it for their own bag; as we were saying, they rule and boost the interests of their subjects—the weaker ones, not the strong—catering to their good, not that of the superior. and that, my dear thrasymachus, is why, like i was just saying, no one’s hyped to govern; cuz no one wants to fix problems that aren’t even their own drama without getting some form of payment. when a true artist’s out here doing his work and dishing orders, he never weighs his own hustle—he’s all about what’s best for his subjects; so for rulers to be down to rule, they gotta get paid in one of three ways: cash money, mad honor, or even a penalty for frontin’.

yo, what you tryna say, socrates? said glaucon. the first two ways of gettin’ paid are hella clear, but the penalty part? i’m straight-up lost on how a penalty can even count as cash.

dude, you seriously ain’t gettin’ that this “payment” – the ultimate flex for the real ones to rule – is the big motivator? obviously, you know that chasin’ clout and mad greed are seen as total cringe, no cap.

facts.

and for that reason, i said, money and honor ain’t on their vibe; the real ones don’t wanna be out here openly demanding fees for runnin’ things and gettin’ tagged as mere hirelings, nor do they wanna sneakily dip into the public loot and get labeled as thieves. since they’re not extra about the cash grind, honor just isn’t their jam. so, necessity has gotta be slapped on 'em, and they’re forced into servin’ outta straight-up fear of punishment. i guess that’s why steppin’ up to take office on your own terms—rather than waitin’ to get pushed in—gets called dishonorable.

and the worst part? if you bounce on rulership, you might end up bein’ ruled by someone even wackier than you. that fear, i reckon, forces the good ones to grab the reins—not 'cause they’re hyped for perks, but simply because they can’t pass the buck to someone better (or even as good as themselves). there’s real talk in thinkin’ that if a city were built entirely of solid peeps, dodgin’ office would be just as much a hot mess as snaggin’ it now; that’d straight-up prove that the true boss isn’t meant to chase personal gain but has to look out for the squad. anyone in the know would rather pocket a benefit from someone else than waste time dishin’ one out themselves.

i’m nowhere near vibin’ with thrasymachus’ idea that justice is just the interest of the strong. now, this later question doesn’t need much more deep-divin’ for now; but when thrasymachus drops that the crooked life is more lit than the just life, that new claim hits way harder. so, which of us is spillin’ the truth? and, glaucon, which life you dig more?

i, for my part, think that livin’ just is hella more advantageous, he answered.

yo, did you catch all the extra perks thrasymachus was spittin’ about for the crooked path?

yeah, i heard his spiel, he replied – but honestly, it didn’t flex enough to convince me.

then, shall we try to show him that his claims are straight-up bogus?

most certainly, he replied.

if, i said, he drops a fixed speech and we hit back with our own lit rundown of the advantages of bein’ just, and he answers and we counter-rap, then we’d just be countin’ and comparin’ the perks on both sides – eventually needin’ a squad of judges to decide; but if we keep our convo real, swapping admissions like we did before, we’d basically merge the roles of judge and lawyer in our own crew.

big mood, he said.

and which method you feel is best? i asked.

the one you just proposed.

aight, then, thrasymachus, i said, let’s rewind to the start: you claim that flawless injustice is way more gainful than flawless justice?

yup, that’s my vibe, and i’ve already dropped my reasons.

so, do you peep one as straight-up virtue and the other as pure vice?

certainly.

so, you’re sayin’ justice equals virtue and injustice equals vice?

what a cute idea! especially since i’m reppin’ injustice as profitable while justice comes off as meh.

what else you got then?

the opposite, he replied.

and would you tag justice as vice?

nah, i’d say it’s pure, sublime simplicity.

so then, would you call injustice malignity?

nah – i’d label it all about discretion.

but yo, do you peep that the crooked peeps come off as wise and dope?

yeah, he said; at least the ones who can nail perfect injustice and have the muscle to boss around states and nations – though maybe you think i’m just talkin’ about lowkey cutpurses. even that shady hustle, if it flies under the radar, has some perks, though they can’t really compare to the ones i just mentioned.

i ain’t tryna diss your meaning, thrasymachus, i replied; but fr, i’m shook that you’re mixin’ injustice with wisdom and virtue, and callin’ justice the total opposite.

yup, i definitely do that.

so, i said, you’re standin’ on some deep, almost unanswerable ground; like, if the injustice you’ve been hypin’ as profitable was also admitted (by you and others) to be straight-up vice and ugliness, then we could’ve shot back with classic principles. but now, i see you’re callin’ injustice honorable and strong, and you’re slappin’ all the same qualities on the crooked that we used to drop on the just – you don’t even blink when you pair injustice with wisdom and virtue.

you read my mind, he replied.

then i certainly won’t back down from this debate as long as i’m feelin’ you, thrasymachus, keepin’ it 100; i totally believe you’re now all in and not just clownin’ at our expense.

i might be dead serious or not, but that’s on you—to shut down the argument is your gig.

facts, i said; that’s my job. but can you answer one more thing? does a just dude try to score extra over another just dude?

nah, on the flip—if he did, he wouldn’t be that chill, low-key vibe creature he is.

and would he ever try to level up past just doin’ what’s right?

he wouldn’t.

so, if he tried to one-up the crooked, would he see it as just or totally off?

he’d think it’s on the up-and-up and try to grab that edge; but he just wouldn’t be able to pull it off.

whether he can or can’t is beside the point, i said; the real tea is whether a just dude, while not tryna outdo another just dude, still wants and claims to have more than the crooked ones?

yep, he would.

and what about the crooked—do they try to score more than the just and do things that aren’t on the level?

of course, he said, ‘cause they’re all about flexin’ to have more than everybody else.

true.

so, rephrase it like this, i said—the just dude only wants more than his non-just crew, not more than his equals, whereas the crooked ones aim to snag more than both their own squad and the outsiders.

nothing, he said, can top that level.

and does that mean the crooked are smart and dope while the just aren’t?

good, he said.

and isn’t it that the crooked are on the same wavelength as the wise and dope, while the just are totally not part of that club?

obviously, he said – if you’re built with that real vibe, you’re just like others who are too; if not, you ain’t.

so, i said, every person is basically what their crew is, right?

certainly, he replied.

solid, thrasymachus, i said; now switch it up to the arts: you cool with sayin’ one dude can be a musician while another isn’t?

yeah.

so, which one’s baller and which one’s basic?

obviously, the musician’s the smart one, and the non-musician comes off as clueless.

and he’s good when he’s on point, and bad when he’s off?

yup.

and you’d drop the same for a physician?

yeah.

and tell me, my excellent friend, do you think a musician, when fine-tunin’ his lyre, would ever try to flex by outperformin’ another musician at adjusting the strings?

i don’t think so.

but he’d definitely wanna outshine a non-musician, right?

of course.

and what about a physician? when handin’ out meats and drinks, would he try to one-up another physician or even the whole med game?

he wouldn’t.

but he’d for sure wanna outdo someone who isn’t a doctor?

yes.

and when it comes to knowledge versus ignorance in general, would any brainiac ever wanna flex by sayin’ or doin’ more than another brainiac? wouldn’t he rather just keep it on the same level as his fellow smart peeps?

that, i suppose, is pretty obvious.

and what about the clueless ones? wouldn’t they be all about havin’ more than both the smart and the clueless?

i dare say.

and the knowledgeable are wise, right?

yes.

and the wise are good?

true.

so, the wise and dope dudes wouldn’t try to snag more than their own crew, but only more than those outside it?

i guess so.

while the trash and clueless ones wanna grab more than everyone else?

yes.

but didn’t we say, thrasymachus, that the crooked go beyond both their own squad and the outsiders? wasn’t that your own drip?

they were.

and you also dropped that the just won’t go beyond their own crew but only target the outsiders?

yes.

so, that means the just are like the wise and dope, and the crooked like the evil and clueless?

that’s the takeaway.

and each person is exactly what their crew is?

that’s a given.

so, in the end, the just come off as wise and dope, and the crooked as evil and clueless.

thrasymachus admitted all this – not in a smooth flow like i just recapped, but with major reluctance; it was a scorchin’ summer day, and sweat was drip-droppin’ off him in torrents; and then i peeped something i’d never seen before – thrasymachus straight-up blushed.

since we were now on the same page that justice equals virtue and wisdom, and injustice equals vice and ignorance, i bounced to another topic:

aight, i said, thrasymachus, that matter’s settled; but didn’t we also say that injustice got mad strength – you feel me?

yeah, i remember, he said, but don’t go thinkin’ i’m vibin’ with your take or that i’ve got no comeback; if i were to drop an answer, you’d totally call me out for goin’ off; so either let me spill my tea, or if you wanna fire questions, do it, and i’ll hit you with a “very good” – like how they nod at those old storytellers – and drop a yes or no.

def not, i said, if it ain’t really your vibe.

yeah, he said, i will – just to keep you happy, since you ain’t lettin’ me speak. what else you want?

nothing in the world, i said; and if you’re down, i’ll ask and you gotta answer.

fire away.

then, i’ll repeat the question i dropped before, so our deep dive into justice versus injustice stays on track. someone said that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, but now that we’ve pegged justice as wisdom and virtue, it’s clear that justice beats injustice (if injustice is just straight-up ignorance) – and that’s unarguable. but i wanna flip the script, thrasymachus: you ain’t gonna disagree that a state can be totally crooked and even try to enslave other states, or might already have 'em on lockdown, right?

true, he replied; and i’d add that the dopest, most perfectly crooked state is the prime candidate to do that.

i know, i said, that’s your whole vibe; but here’s my twist: can that mad power of the top state roll without justice, or does it only pop off when justice is in the mix?

if you’re right and justice equals wisdom, then it only rolls with justice; but if i’m right, then it can run wild without justice.

i’m straight-up vibin’, thrasymachus, seeing you nod both yes and no and droppin’ some fire answers.

that’s just courtesy for you, he replied.

you’re too kind, i said; now do me a solid and tell me—do you think a state, an army, or even a crew of robbers and thieves (or any gang of evildoers) could even roll if they started messin’ with each other?

nah, for sure, he said – they wouldn’t last.

but if they kept it chill and didn’t hurt each other, then they could squad up better?

yeah.

and that’s 'cause crookedness just sparks mad divisions, beef, and chaos, while justice drops harmony and squad goals; right, thrasymachus?

i totally vibe with that, he said, ‘cause i’m not tryna throw hands with you.

mad props, i said; but i gotta know—since injustice always courts beef wherever it pops off (among slaves or free peeps), wouldn’t it just make everyone turn on each other and wreck any chance of squad action?

definitely.

and even if only two peeps are doin’ injustice, wouldn’t they end up beefin’ and clashing, turnin’ enemy not only with each other but with the just crowd too?

they sure will.

and if injustice chills in just one person, do you reckon they lose their natural power or keep it?

let’s assume they keep their power.

but seriously, isn’t the force of injustice such that wherever it sets up shop – be it in a city, an army, a fam, or any crew – that squad ends up all over the place, unable to unite ‘cause of constant sedition and distraction? doesn’t it turn them into their own worst enemy and start beef with anyone that opposes them, including the just?

yes, totally.

and isn’t injustice just as fatal when it’s locked in one person – first makin’ him unable to act 'cause he’s not vibin’ with himself, and second, turnin’ him into an enemy of both himself and the just? true, thrasymachus?

yes.

and yo, my dude, i said, the gods are legit just, right?

granted they are.

but if that’s the case, then the crooked are basically enemies of the gods, and the just are on the gods’ squad?

feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; i won’t step in, ‘cause i ain’t tryna ruffle the squad’s vibes.

alright then, drop your answers, and let me grab the rest of my snack. we already showed that the just are hella smarter, better, and more boss than the crooked, and the crooked can’t squad up at all; plus, talkin’ 'bout totally evil dudes ever vibin’ together is off – ‘cause if they were completely evil, they’d just end up clashing with each other; clearly, there’s some leftover justice in 'em that even lets them combine – otherwise, they’d wreck each other along with their victims. they’re just half-ass villains in their hustle; if they were full-on villains and utterly crooked, they’d be completely incapable of rollin’. that’s the real tea, not what you dropped at first. but whether the just live a way better, happier life than the crooked is another level we gotta dive into. i reckon they do, based on all the deets i just laid out; but i still wanna break it down further, ‘cause we’re talkin’ about the very rule of human life here.

fire away.

now, imma ask: wouldn’t you say a horse has a purpose?

i would.

and the purpose or use of a horse – or of anything – is basically that thing which no other tool can hit, or can’t hit as hard?

i’m not vibin’ – what’s that mean? he said.

lemme break it down: can you see without using your eyes?

certainly not.

or hear without your ears?

nope.

so, these are legit the purposes of those organs, right?

they are.

but yo, you can cut a vine branch with a dagger or a chisel, or a bunch of other tools, right?

of course.

but not as smoothly as with a pruning-hook made for that exact job?

true.

so, can we say that the purpose of a pruning-hook is exactly that?

we can.

now, i think you’re catchin’ my drift about askin’ whether the purpose of anything is that which no other thing can do, or can’t do as well.

i get your meaning, he said, noddin’ in agreement.

and that whatever’s got a purpose also has its own excellence? do i really need to ask if the eye’s got a purpose?

it does.

and doesn’t the eye also have some mad excellence?

yes.

and the ear’s got a purpose and its own excellence too?

true.

and same goes for all other things – each thing has a purpose and its own special excellence?

exactly.

so, can eyes even do their job if they lose their own inherent swag and end up with defects?

how would they, he said, if they’re blind and can’t see?

you mean, if they lose the very excellence that is sight? but i’m not there yet. i just wanna ask generally whether things that nail their purpose do so because they got the proper excellence, and if they’re deficient, they totally flop.

definitely, he replied.

i could say the same for ears; when they lose their proper excellence, they can’t hit their purpose, right?

true.

and that vibe applies to everything else too?

i agree.

now, what about the soul – doesn’t it have a purpose that nothing else can fulfill? like, to boss up, command, deliberate, and all that? aren’t those functions totally meant for the soul, and can’t be handed off to anyone else?

to literally no one else.

and ain’t life itself one of the soul’s major goals?

assuredly, he said.

and doesn’t the soul also have its own dope excellence?

yes.

so, can it still nail its goals if it’s stripped of that excellence?

it just can’t.

then, an evil soul is bound to be a wack ruler and boss, while a good soul is gonna be a lit ruler, right?

yes, no cap, necessarily.

and we already dropped that justice is the soul’s supreme excellence and injustice is its major flaw?

that’s locked in.

so, the just soul and the just dude will live dope, and the crooked dude will live rough?

that’s exactly what your argument proves.

and the one livin’ well is blessed and happy, while the one livin’ rough is basically cursed and miserable?

certainly.

so, the just are happy and the crooked are miserable?

so be it.

but bein’ happy instead of miserable is where the real profit is at.

of course.

then, my blessed thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable than justice.

let this, socrates, he said, be your binge-worthy entertainment at the bendidea.

for that, i’m kinda owe you, i said, now that you’ve chilled out and stopped throwin’ shade at me. still, i wasn’t exactly entertained – but that’s on me, not you. like, it’s as if an epicurean dude grabs a taste of every dish as they roll by without ever stoppin’ to savor the last one; so i hopped from one topic to the next without actually nailin’ down what i originally sought – the real nature of justice. i bailed on that quest and switched gears to debate whether justice equals virtue and wisdom or is just pure evil and dumb; and when another question about the perks of justice versus injustice popped off, i couldn’t help but dive in. and the final tea of this whole sesh? i know nothin’ at all. i got no clue what justice really is, so i can’t say whether it’s a virtue or a flop, nor can i tell if the just dude’s truly happy or totally bummed out.

book ii.

with those words, i figured i’d wrapped up the convo; but real talk, that end was just the kickoff. glaucon, always the most trigger-happy dude, wasn’t down with thrasymachus bouncin’ – he was all, “let’s throw down for real.” so he hit me with, “socrates, you tryna actually school us, or just fakin’ like you convinced us that bein’ just is always better than bein’ crooked?”

i’d really love to school you, i replied, if i could.

then, clearly, you ain’t nailed it. now lemme ask: how would you sort out the goods – aren’t there some things we stan just for their own vibe, independent of any follow-up perks, like harmless pleasures that hit different in the moment even if nothing extra drops later?

i totally vibe with that idea, i replied.

and ain’t there also a second squad of goods – like knowledge, sight, health – that are dope not only on their own but also for the glow-ups they bring?

certainly, i said.

yo, wouldn't you peep a third squad like gym class vibes, sick-care crew, and doc skills; plus all those money-making side hustles—lowkey they do us good but we still think they're kinda sus; nobody's choosing 'em for the pure feels, only 'cause they bring that extra clout or reward, no cap.

yeah, there's a third crew too. but why you askin'?

straight up, i wanna know—in your three-tier menu, where you droppin' justice?

i replied, "it's in the supreme squad—the kind of glow-up a true vibe-seeker wants both for the pure feels and for that epic payoff."

then a bunch of peeps be like, "nah fam, justice is actually in the sus squad—it's all about chasing clout and receipts, but on its own, it's hella meh and best left ghosted."

i know, i said, that's literally their flex, and that was exactly the tea thrasymachus was droppin' just now—roasting justice and hyping up injustice. but real talk, i'm too stupid to get swayed by his cringey drip.

i wish, he said, that you tuned into my vibe as hard as you did his, then we'd see if we’re on the same wavelength. like, thrasymachus got snagged by your voice like a snake mesmerized by sick beats, but honestly, the real lowdown on justice and injustice is still mad foggy for me. ditching all that clout and reward talk, i wanna know what they are deep down and how they work on the soul. if you’re cool, then imma resurrect thrasymachus’s argument. first up, imma spill the tea on the nature and origin of justice as the squad normally sees it; next, i'll flex that every dude who plays justice is doing it on auto-pilot outta necessity—not 'cause it’s inherently lit; and finally, imma hit you with the fact that, if their claim is on point, the shady life is way more fire than being straight-up just—though, socrates, i'm not about that vibe myself. still, i gotta admit, my ears are drowning in thrasymachus and a million other voices, and i've yet to hear anyone convincingly proving that justice trumps injustice on its own. i need to hear justice hyped for the sake of pure justice; then i'll chill, and i know you're the plug who can drop that tea. so imma go full send praising the unjust life, and my flow will show how i wanna see you hype justice and roast injustice. you down with that plan?

i'm totally vibing with it; honestly, i can't think of anything more lit to rap about.

i'm hella hyped to hear that, he replied, so imma kick off by dropping the deets on the nature and roots of justice.

they be sayin' that dishing out injustice is lowkey a win, while catchin' it is hella bad—but the bad vibes always outweigh the good. so when peeps have both served and taken injustice, and can't dodge one or snag the other, they squad up and be like, "nah, let's just skip this game," and boom—laws and mutual deals drop in. whatever gets stamped by law becomes what they call legit and just. this is the tea on justice’s origin—a remix between the dopest move of doing injustice and dodging punishment, and the worst-case of suffering injustice with zero recoil; justice just lands in the middle, not lit as a win, but as the lesser evil, respected only 'cause folks ain't got the juice to be blatantly unjust. cuz real ones, who actually earn their stripes, would never sign up for that lame deal if they could fight it off—they'd be straight trippin'. that's the ancient account, socrates, on how justice came to be.

now, peep this: the real tea on peeps who ride justice is that they do it involuntarily, 'cause they ain't got the power to be shady. to get the full picture, imagine if both the just and the unjust had full-on free reign—let's watch where their cravings take 'em. you'd see that both squads end up chasing what they think is their ultimate win, but only get shoved onto the justice track by the law's hard push. and that freedom? it’d be cranked up if we call it the power that gyges—ancestor of croesus from lydia—was rumored to have. word on the street is, gyges was just a shepherd grindin' for the lydia king; when a mega storm and earthquake cracked the ground where he was chillin' with his flock, my dude slid down and discovered a hollow bronze horse with doors. there, he peeped a dead homie, lookin' larger-than-life and rockin' nothing but a gold ring. he yeeted that ring off the corpse and bounced back up. later, when the shepherd crew gathered to drop their monthly report to the king, gyges strolled in with that ring. while he was kickin' it, he accidentally flipped the ring’s collar inward—boom, he went invisible, and the squad started chattin' like he dipped. he was shook, so he twisted it back outward and reappeared. after a few tests—same drill: inward equals vanish, outward equals visible—he plotted his move, got picked as one of the court's runners, and once there, seduced the queen. with her help, he clapped the king and snatched the whole kingdom. now, picture if there were two magic rings—one on the just crew and one on the shady crew; no dude's got the guts to stick to pure justice if he could flex being shady. honestly, no one would leave cash on the table, or pass up swiping what isn't theirs at the market, or crash any crib for a chill sesh, or even off someone from jail, if they could safely do it, flexing like a god among mortals. then, the moves of the just and the shady would look identical—they’d both end up at the same point. and that's solid proof that no one is just by choice or 'cause they think justice ups their personal game—they only roll with justice 'cause they can't safely be shady. deep down, every soul knows that dodgy moves bring way more wins than being on the level, and anyone vibin' with my theory will agree. imagine someone with that invisibility clout who never does wrong or touches someone else's stash—they’d be seen as a major clown by the watchers, even though they'd get secret props out of fear of catching injustice themselves. enough of that hot mess.

alright, if we wanna seriously judge the just life versus the shady life, we gotta isolate 'em—no mixing allowed. how we do that? here’s the play: let the shady dude be 100% shady, and the just homie be 100% just; nothing gets cut, and both come fully loaded for their own grind. first up, let the shady guy be like a boss-level pro—like a slick pilot or next-level doctor who knows his limits and can bounce back if he slips. so, let him pull off his shady moves the right way and keep it on the DL if he wants to level up in injustice (because if he gets caught, he's done for—nobody's buying that). the ultimate of being shady is when you're falsely tagged as just, even though you're not. so i say, in a truly shady dude, we gotta assume he deploys the peak of injustice; no discounts allowed, but still he scores the highest rep for appearing just while doing the most off moves. if he stumbles, he better be able to recover fast; he’s gotta be smooth on the mic if his moves leak, and use his strength, cash, and squad power to bulldoze through when needed. meanwhile, right next to him, we got the truly just guy—noble and simple, actually wanting to be good instead of just lookin' it—like aeschylus said, to be and not just seem. there should be zero fakin', 'cause if a dude only seems just, he'll rack up honors and rewards, and then we can’t tell if he’s truly just or just chasin' clout; so let him be draped in only genuine justice, with no extra flair; picture him livin' the complete opposite life from the shady one. let him be the best of men, even if the world thinks he's the worst—then his real self gets tested. and let him ride that vibe all the way to the grave, being just inside while appearin' shady outside. when both push to the extremes—the one on justice and the one on injustice—let's drop the final verdict: which one ends up truly happier?

bro, my dear glaucon, i said, how you shinin' these up for the showdown—like you're polishing two statues one after the other.

i do my best, he replied. now that we peep their true profiles, it's easy to map out the life path awaiting each. imma break it down now; but if my description comes off a bit raw, socrates, just roll with it and imagine these words coming straight from the eulogists of injustice: they'll tell you that the just dude who gets tagged as shady ends up getting whipped, tortured, tied up—have his eyes burned out; and then, after catchin' every kind of L, he even gets impaled. then he realizes he should just look the part and not actually be just; aeschylus's lines might actually vibe better for the shady crew than the truly just. cuz the unjust are chasing the real deal—they don’t live for appearance; they wanna be actual shady, not just seem it.

"his mind got that deep, fertile dirt where all his dope brain moves just spring up, no cap."

first off, peeps see him as straight-up just, so he runs the city scene; he can marry whoever he wants and even hook up others, trade and deal wherever, always flipping it to his own advantage 'cause he ain't got no guilt about being shady; in every matchup—public or private—he claps his rivals, cashes in on their losses, stacks that paper, and uses his gains to boost his friends and wreck his enemies. on top of that, he can drop lavish sacrifices and epic gifts to the gods, and honor whoever he pleases way better than the truly just, meaning he's likely even more favored by the gods. so, socrates, it's like gods and mortals team up to make the shady life way more baller than the just life.

i was about to drop some words to glaucon when adeimantus, his bro, jumped in: "socrates, you ain't gonna tell us there's nothing else to add, right?"

i was like, "c'mon, what else is there to yeet?"

he shot back, "yo, you missed the absolute strongest flex of them all."

aight, then, as the old saying goes, "let brother help brother"—if a dude flops anywhere, you gotta back him up; even tho, i gotta admit, glaucon already spilled enough tea to put me on blast and strip me of any clout in boosting justice.

nah, bogus, he replied. but lemme drop some extra tea: there's another angle to glaucon’s whole spiel on praising and trashing justice versus injustice—which you gotta catch to get his drift. basically, our parents and teachers are always on us about staying just; but why? not for the love of justice itself, but for rep and clout—in hopes that if you're known as just, you unlock dope offices, marriages, and all those perks glaucon mentioned that shady folks get from the rep of justice. plus, this crew cares more about the looks than the real deal; they even throw in the gods' blessing and hype up how a shower of benefits rains on the pious—as told by the noble hesiod and homer. hesiod drops lines sayin' that the gods make the oaks of the just "bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle; and the sheep get bowed down by their heavy fleeces," and serves up a load of similar epic blessings. homer’s on the same beat: he hypes up a dude whose rep is "like that of a flawless king who, like a god, keeps it just; to whom the black earth drops wheat and barley, whose trees are loaded with fruit, and his sheep never bail, while the sea hooks him up with fish."

and yo, the heavenly gifts for the just are even next-level—musaeus and his son drop blessings straight into the mortal realm, where saints are chillin' on couches at eternal ragers, always smashed and crowned with garlands; apparently, an everlasting binge is the ultimate badge of virtue. some even say that the squad of the faithful and just will flex their legacy through third and fourth generations. that's the vibe when they hype justice. but when it comes to the wicked, they flip the script: they dump them in a gross slough in hades, making 'em haul water with a broken sieve; plus, while they're still livin', they drag their names through the mud and hit 'em with all the punishments glaucon described for those just dudes who are mistaken as shady—nothing extra in their punishment toolkit. that's how they serve praise for one and throw major shade for the other.

once more, socrates, lemme ask you to peep another angle on justice and injustice—a spin not just from the poets, but also from the straight-up prose voices. the universal voice of mankind keeps shoutin' that justice and virtue are mad respectable but hella heavy and toilsome; meanwhile, the perks of vice and being shady are super accessible, only gettin' clapped for by law and public opinion. they even say that being honest is usually less profitable than dodgy moves; and they're quick to call bad dudes happy, hyping 'em publicly and privately when they're rich or influential, while dissing and ghosting the weak and broke—even though deep down, they know those weakies are better than the rest. but the wildest flex is how they rap about virtue and the gods: they claim the gods dole out mad misery to way too many good peeps, while blessing the shady ones with all the good vibes. then, those hustlin' prophets show up at rich dudes' doors, convincing them that they've been handed divine power to clear a man’s or his ancestors' sins through sacrifices, charms, epic feasts, and ragers; promising to smack an enemy—just for a small fee—using magic and incantations that supposedly bind the heavens to their will. and the poets? they’re the OG authorities who smooth out the path of vice with hesiod’s bars: "vice may be had in abundance without any hassle; the way's smooth and her crib is right nearby. but before virtue, the gods set you on a grind," a tedious uphill hustle. then they drop homer as witness that even the gods can get swayed by mortals; like, he says, "the gods, too, can be turned from their groove; and dudes pray to them, dodging their wrath with sacrifices, chill entreaties, libations, and that bomb aroma of fat when they've totally screwed up."

and then they serve up a whole squad of books by musaeus and orpheus—the so-called kids of the moon and the muses, as they claim—in which they flex their ritual moves and convince not just individuals but entire cities that you can wipe your sin slate clean with sacrifices and dope distractions that fill a free hour, serving both the living and the dead; for the dead, they call it "mysteries," which are supposed to redeem us from hellish pain, but if we ghost 'em, no one even knows what epic L awaits.

he proceeded: "and now, when the youngins catch all this chatter about virtue and vice, and how gods and mortals rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i'm talkin' about the quick-witted crew, buzzing like bees all over every dope flower, scooping up all these takes on what kinda peeps they should be and how they should roll if they wanna live their best life. probably these youth will be like quoting pindar in their head: 'can i, by keepin' it just or by flexin' some crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people be sayin' that if i'm truly just and also seen as just, there's zero profit—instead, you'll only suffer mad pain and losses. but if, while bein' shady, i score the rep of justice, then a heavenly life is on the menu. since philosophers proved that appearances flex harder than truth and rule the happiness game, i gotta ride that look. i'll deck out the front of my crib with a picture-perfect vibe of virtue; and behind the scenes, i'll let a sly, crafty fox shadow my moves—just as archilochus, the dopest of sages, recommends. and sure, i hear some peep yellin' that hidin' your shady deets is mad difficult; to that, i say, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth, we'll set up secret crews and underground political clubs. plus, there are straight-up rhetoric profs teachin' how to sway courts and assemblies; so, mixin' smooth talk with a bit of muscle, i can snag illegal gains and dodge the heat. and yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be fooled or forced. but what if there are no gods—or if they could care less about human drama? then why sweat about stayin' lowkey? and even if the gods are on our side, we only know 'em from legends and poet family trees—the very same folks who claim they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it 100: either we buy it all or we don't. if the poets are droppin' straight facts, then we had better be shady AF and cash in on those unjust gains; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge cosmic revenge, we'll miss out on the sweet wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating between sinning and prayin', the gods get all appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future crew will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the reflection—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with epic power. that's what the major cities be proclaimin', and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same truth.

. . .

so then he went on, "and now when the young bloods get all this talk on virtue and vice, and how gods and peeps rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i mean, the sharp ones—buzzin' like bees across every dope flower and snatching up conclusions about how they should roll—might be like, in the words of pindar, 'can i, by bein' just or by pullin' off crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people say if i'm actually just and also seen as just, then there’s zero profit—and you'll only rack up pain and loss. but if, while bein' shady, i secure the rep of justice, then a heavenly life gets promised to me. since philosophers proved that appearances straight-up rule over truth and happiness, i gotta devote myself to that vibe. i'll set up a dope picture of virtue as the entrance and face of my crib; and behind it, i'll let the subtle, crafty fox of deception trail my moves, just like archilochus—the dopest sage—recommended. sure, i hear someone shout that hidin' your shady side is mad tough; to that, i hit back, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the whole argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth mode, we'll form secret brotherhoods and underground political clubs. plus, there are rhetoric professors droppin' lessons on persuading courts and assemblies; so, partly with slick talk and partly with muscle, i can snag illegal gains and avoid the heat. yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be tricked or forced. but what if there are no gods? or, if they literally don't give a damn about human biz—why should we even sweat the stealth? and even if the gods are out there, we only know 'em from legends and poet fam trees—and those same poets drop that they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it real: either we buy into it all or we don't. if the poets are spittin' truth, then we had better go full shady and bank on the gains of injustice; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge heaven's vengeance, we lose out on the unlawful wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating sinning and prayin'—sinning and prayin'—the gods get appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future squad will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the takeaway—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with major clout. that's the word from the big leagues, and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same testimony.

on what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice? like, if we just squad up the worst injustice with some extra shady flex on appearances, then both the gods and the homies in life and in the afterlife are totally vibing with that, as the most extra and highest authorities be preaching. now, socrates, with all that cosmic tea in play, how in the world is any dude with extra smarts, clout, rank, or stacks ever gonna be down to honor justice—or even chill enough not to crack up when justice gets hyped? and even if some genius comes around to drop the truth bomb that justice is the real mvp, he still ain’t throwing fits at the baddie crew; he’s hella down to forgive ’em, ‘cause he knows straight up that peeps don’t just pick justice by free will—unless, of course, some inner divine flex inspires a savage hate for injustice or he unlocks the secret sauce of truth (and no other normie can claim that). honestly, only the weak sauce who, thanks to being a total wuss, old, or just low on clout, can’t even flex being unjust will end up roasting injustice; and, no cap, as soon as that weak sauce gets the power, he goes full-on unjust mode, doing the maximum diss.

yo, the root of all this, socrates, was already dropped at the start of our chat, when my bro and i were like, “we were shook that among all the justice squad—right from the ancient hero legends (whose drip has been preserved for us) to the modern-day peeps—not one of these justice clout preachers ever dissed injustice or hyped justice except to flex the glories, honors, and epic perks that come with them.” no one has ever seriously laid down in verse or prose the true core vibe of either justice or injustice chillin’ in the soul, hidden from the mortal or the divine eye; or shown that, out of all the swag in a man’s soul, justice is the ultimate boss buff and injustice the sickest debuff. if that lit vibe had been the universal track, if y’all had been schooling us on that since back in the day, none of us would’ve been out here on guard trying to stop each other from going off—instead, every dude would’ve been his own bouncer, scared that a wrong move would load him up with the deadliest virus. i’d bet that thrasymachus and the rest would be lowkey saying that the words i’m droppin’—or even harsher ones—about justice and injustice are, in my honest flex, totally twisting their true nature. but i’m spitting this heat in all that passionate fashion, gotta be real with y’all, ‘cause i wanna hear your flip side; and i need you to show not only that justice slaps way harder than injustice, but also break down what kind of glow-up they give to whoever holds ‘em—making one a straight-up good boi and the other a total villain, whether the gods and the homies can peep it or not.

i always had mad respect for the genius of glaucón and adeimantus, but when these words dropped, i was hella hyped and was like, “sons of an illustrious father, that was a chill kickoff to the elegiac verses our biggest fan dropped for you after you absolutely clapped at the battle of megara:— ‘sons of ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’” that title is bang on, ‘cause there’s something totally divine about debating the superiority of injustice while still being unconvinced by your own drip. and i seriously feel that y’all ain’t even vibing with your own argument—i can peep that just from your overall aura, ‘cause if i was only judging by your soundbites, i’d be throwing major shade. but now, the more i trust your genius vibes, the tougher it is for me to pick the right words. i’m caught between two modes; on one side, i feel like i’m not cut out for this epic flex, and on the other, i’m low on clout ‘cause you weren’t down with the answer i threw at thrasymachus proving that justice is the ultimate upgrade over injustice. yet, i can’t just ghost the convo while i still got breath and words to drop; i fear it’d be a straight-up sin to sit back and let justice get clapped without throwing down a defense. so, i gotta step up and drop whatever fire i got.

glaucón and the rest were all up in my dms begging me not to let the deep dive drop, but to keep probing the truth about justice and injustice and their relative wins. i told them straight up that this quest is gonna be a heavy-duty ride, and it’s gonna need some next-level vision to nail it. so, i was like, “since we’re not exactly the einsteins of the century, we should roll with a hack: imagine a peep with super bad eyesight is asked to read tiny text from afar; then someone is like, ‘yo, maybe these words are over here where they’re bigger’—if it’s the same text and he can read the big letters first and then the small ones, that’d be a rare lucky flex.”

“very true,” said adeimantus; “but how does that vibe drop into our inquiry?”

“i’ll break it down,” i replied; “justice, the main tea of our quest, is sometimes dropped as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the overall vibe of a state.”

“true,” he replied.

“and a state is def bigger than a single homie, right?”

“it is.”

“then in the bigger picture, justice is likely more massive and easier to peep. i propose we scope out the nature of justice and injustice first as they roll in the state, and then zoom in on the individual—going from big to small and comparing the vibes.”

“bet, that’s a killer plan.”

“and if we picture the state while it’s still in beta, we’re gonna see justice and injustice emerging along with it.”

“i dare say so.”

“and once the state hits its full release, maybe the cheat-code to our search will drop even easier.”

“yes, far more easily.”

“but yo, should we even try building one? honestly, to construct one is a mega serious flex. think on that.”

“i’ve been thinking, and i’m hyped for you to keep it rolling,” adeimantus said.

so i said, “a state pops off, in my view, from the wild needs of mankind; no one’s riding solo, ‘cause we all got mad wants. can you even imagine any other OG origin for a state?”

“there’s literally no other way.”

“then, since we all got a bunch of needs and a crew is needed to cover ‘em, you grab a helper for one vibe and another for a different one; and when you gather all these partners in one crib, boom—that’s a state.”

“true,” he said.

“and they’re swapping with each other—one drops his goods and the other picks ‘em up—thinking the trade’s gonna be a win-win, a straight flex for everyone.”

“very true.”

“so, let’s start by building a mental state; but remember, the true creator here is necessity, the original mom of our hustle.”

“of course,” he replied.

“now, the numero uno and biggest need is food—the fuel for life.”

“definitely.”

“next up is a crib, and then fresh threads and all that.”

“true.”

“and now, let’s see how our city can handle this major demand: suppose one dude’s a farmer, another’s a builder, someone else slays as a weaver—should we throw in a shoemaker, or maybe another peep to cover our bodily needs?”

“exactly right.”

“in the most basic blueprint of a state, you gotta have like four or five peeps.”

“for real.”

“and how they grind? will each homie drop the fruits of his hustle into a common stash—like the farmer producing extra for the squad, hustling four times as hard to feed not just himself but everyone; or will he ghost collaborating and only handle his own chunk of the feed in a fraction of the time, then spend the rest of his grind building a crib, a coat, or kicks—doing his own thing without teaming up, just handling his own biz?”

adeimantus was like, “i think it’s better if he just focuses on farming instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.”

“probably,” i replied, “that’s the smarter play; and hearing that reminds me that we’re all built diff—our natures are prepped for different hustles.”

“very true.”

“and yo, isn’t a task way more on point when a homie sticks to one gig rather than juggling a whole buffet of work?”

“when he’s on one, it’s def better.”

“plus, no cap, a job is straight-up doomed if it ain’t done at the right moment.”

“no doubt.”

“business isn’t waiting for the homie to chill; he’s gotta lock in his hustle and make it his top priority.”

“facts.”

“so, if that’s the case, then everything gets produced more smoothly, in bulk, and with better quality when a dude just does the one thing he’s naturally built for at the perfect time and leaves the rest alone.”

“undoubtedly.”

“hence, we need more than four citizens; ’cause the farmer ain’t gonna whip up his own plow or mattock if he wants them to perform, and the builder won’t craft his own tools—he’s gonna need a squad; same goes for the weaver and the shoemaker.”

“true.”

“so then carpenters, smiths, and a whole bunch of other artisans will be part of our little state that’s already starting to grow?”

“true.”

“and even if we add herdsmen, shepherds, and other animal handlers—so our farmer squad can cop oxen for plowing, and builders and farmers can get draft cattle, while curriers and weavers score fleeces and hides—our state is still gonna be pretty modest.”

“that’s true; but it won’t be super tiny either as long as all these peeps are in the mix.”

“then, again, there’s the sitch of the city—finding a spot where nothing needs to be imported is basically impossible.”

“impossible.”

“so there must be another class of citizens who roll in with the goods from another city, right?”

“there has to be.”

“if a trader rolls up empty-handed with nothing for the peeps who need him, he’s just gonna bounce back with nada.”

“that’s for sure.”

“so what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but also so epic in both quantity and quality that it hooks up those who bring in the missing vibes.”

“very true.”

“then more farmers and more artisans will be needed?”

“they will.”

“not to mention the importers and exporters, aka the merchants?”

“yes.”

“then we’re gonna need merchants?”

“we are.”

“and if merchandise has to be carried over the sea, mad skilled sailors are gonna be needed in huge numbers?”

“yes, in huge numbers.”

“then, back in the city, how do they swap their drip? setting up that exchange was, as you remember, one of our main moves when we squad’d up and formed a state.”

“clearly, they’re gonna be buying and selling.”

“so they’re gonna need a marketplace, plus some coin—a money-token—for smooth exchanges.”

“definitely.”

“imagine now if a farmer or artisan brings his goods to market and shows up when there’s nobody around to trade—does he just dip and chill, leaving his hustle behind?”

“not at all; he’ll find peeps there who, spotting the gap, step in as the official sales crew. in well-run states, these are usually the ones who aren’t exactly jacked up—low on muscle and thus not too useful for heavy lifting—so their only gig is to chill in the market, swapping cash for goods with sellers and grabbing coin from buyers.”

“this need creates a class of retail traders in our state. isn’t ‘retailer’ the term for those holding down the market spot, while the roaming squad between cities get dubbed merchants?”

“yes, exactly.”

“and then there’s another crew of workers who might not be brainiacs but are jacked enough for heavy labor—they sell their strength and are called, if i’m not tripping, hirelings (with ‘hire’ being the tag on the price of their grind).”

“true.”

“so hirelings help bulk up our population?”

“yes.”

“and now, adeimantus, is our state all leveled up and perfect?”

“i think so.”

“then, where’s justice and where’s injustice, and in which corner of the state did they drop in?”

“i’d say they pop off in the way these citizens interact with each other. i can’t see them cropping up anywhere else.”

“i dare say you’re onto something,” i said; “we’d better really think this through and not shy away from the inquiry.”

“let’s then peep their way of life now that our state is on lock. won’t they be growing corn, brewing wine, sewing threads, cobbling shoes, and building cribs for themselves? and once they’re housed, they’ll be grinding all summer—usually stripped down and barefoot—but in winter, they’re gonna be decked out with full gear and kicks. they’ll chow down on grub like barley-meal and wheat dough, baking and kneading them into noble cakes and loaves; served up on reed mats or clean leaves while they chill on beds dotted with yew or myrtle vibes. then, they and their kiddos will go all out feasting—sipping the wine they brewed, rocking garlands on their dome, and hyping the gods in a lit hangout session. plus, they’ll keep it real by making sure their fam stays within budget, always watchful of poverty or the threat of war.”

“but,” interjected glaucón, “hold up—you didn’t add any extra flavor or relish to their meal, did you?”

“true,” i replied, “i totally spaced that—of course they gotta have a killer relish: salt, olives, and cheese, with roots and herbs boiled up just like the country peeps do; for dessert, we’ll dish out figs, peas, and beans; and they’ll roast myrtle berries and acorns over the fire, sipping moderately. with a menu like that, they’re set to live in peace and health for ages and pass down that vibe to their kiddos.”

“yes, socrates,” he said, “and if you were feeding a city of pigs, how else would you keep the beasts fed?”

“but what would you have, glaucón?” i replied.

“dude, you gotta hook them up with the everyday luxuries—soft sofas to chill on, fancy tables to dine off, and modern sauces and sweets to keep it lit.”

“yeah,” i said, “now i catch your drift: you want me to explore not just the basics of a state but also how to build a deluxe, luxury state; and honestly, no harm in that, ‘cause in a deluxe state we might see how justice and injustice really pop off. in my opinion, the true and healthy constitution of a state is the one i just laid out—but if you’re also about that extra hype, i’m down. i suspect plenty of peeps won’t settle for the simple life. they’ll be about adding sofas, tables, and a whole lot of extra flair; along with gourmet treats, dainties, perfumes, incense, courtesans, cakes in every flavor—not just one kind, but mad varieties. we’d be pushing past the basic needs of cribs, threads, and kicks: the arts like painting and embroidery would have to get in on the hustle, and gold, ivory, and pretty much every kind of bling would need to be snatched up.”

“true,” he said.

“then we gotta expand our borders, ‘cause the OG healthy state just won’t cut it. now the city will have to swell with a massive crew of extra gigs that aren’t needed for the bare necessities—like an entire tribe of hunters and performers (one squad handling visuals and colors, another squad dropping beats and rhymes with poets, players, dancers, and managers), plus makers of all kinds of goods (even women’s dresses). and we’ll need even more assistants. won’t there be a serious need for tutors, nurses (both wet and dry), tirewomen, barbers, bakers, and cooks; and even pig herders, who weren’t on the roster before but are now totally in demand? they can’t be forgotten—and if peeps are munching on animals, a bunch of other critters will be needed too.”

“definitely.”

“and living all this luxe, we’re gonna need way more physicians than before, right?”

“way more.”

“plus, the land that used to support the original crew will be way too cramped now.”

“totally true.”

“then we’ll have to snag a slice of our neighbors’ land for extra pasture and farming, and they might end up wanting a slice of ours too if, like us, they overdo the flex and chase endless wealth.”

“that, socrates, is inevitable.”

“and so, glaucón, looks like we’re heading to war, huh?”

“most certainly,” he replied.

“then, without even deciding whether war is a win or a fail, one thing’s for sure: war comes from the same wild causes that brew nearly every evil in both private and public states.”

“undoubtedly.”

“and our state must expand again—and this time, the upgrade is straight-up an army that has to roll out and battle invaders for every bit of what we got, as well as for the peeps and goods we just broke down.”

“why though?” he asked; “aren’t they strong enough to defend themselves?”

“no,” i said, “not if we stick with that principle we all peeped when we built the state: one dude just can’t nail a bunch of arts at once.”

“very true,” he replied.

“but like, isn’t war an art in itself?”

“definitely.”

“and an art that needs as much focus as, say, shoemaking?”

“definitely, no cap.”

and yo, our squad straight up banned the shoemaker from doing extra gigs like farming, weaving, or building—cuz we needed those kicks on fleek, no cap; each homie got one designated grind that just vibes with their natural drip, and they had to stick to that hustle for life, fr only that gig. no one’s allowed to ghost their chance to level up, else their work game stays lame. honestly, nothing is a bigger flex than soldiers nailing their battle hustle.

but like, can you really think war is such a chill skill to pick up that a dude can be a warrior while also doing farming, shoemaking, or any other artisanal hustle? cuz ngl, no one’s ever been lit at dice or checkers if they just dabble for fun without grinding hardcore from day one. no fancy gear can turn you into a boss workman or defense master if you never put in the hours learning the moves. so how in this meme-filled kingdom is some dude gonna grab a shield or any war gadget and go full fighter in a single day, whether he’s squad-dealin’ heavy fire or rocking any other troop flex?

yeah, he dropped that those epic tools teaching peeps how to use their own gear are straight up priceless, no cap.

and i was like, yo, the bigger the guardian job gets, the more major hours, sick skills, savage art, and hustle are gonna be required, right?

no doubt, fam, he snapped back.

and don't forget, he gotta be born with that clutch vibe for the hustle, right?

straight up, no cap.

so basically, it's on us to flex our selection game and scoop up those natty types who are a perfect match for guarding the city’s crib, bet?

for real, it will.

and i was like, yo, picking these guardians ain’t a walk in the park, but we gotta be bold and put in all our savage effort.

bet, we absolutely must.

aren't the noble youngins just like a snatched, well-bred pupper when it comes to guarding and peeping?

what's that even vibe though?

i mean, both gotta be super on point with their vision, hella fast in catching enemy lurkers, and straight up buff enough to throw down when it's go time.

all those dope traits, he iced, are an absolute must for the guardian squad.

and i mean, your guardian gotta have guts if they're gonna wreck it in battle, right?

100%, definitely.

and honestly, can a dude be brave with zero spunk, whether he's riding a hooptie, flexing like a pupper, or reppin' any beast? seriously, have you not peeped how pure spirit is untouchable and boss-level, making any soul totally fearless and unbreakable?

i mean, i've def caught that vibe.

so basically, we now got a vibe-check on the physical glow-up needed for a guardian.

facts.

and don’t sleep on the brain game too; his soul gotta be lit with spirit, eh?

hell yeah.

but yo, aren’t these extra spirited peeps prone to throw shade and go savage on each other and everyone else, fr?

he admitted that's a major diff obstacle to squash, no cap.

but i was like, they gotta be absolute beasts to their haters and total softies for their squad; otherwise, they’re gonna be self-sabotaging, crashing their own vibe before their enemies even get a chance.

facts, he clapped.

so what’s the move then? i asked—how the heck do we scoop a mellow vibe that still packs that insane spirit, cuz those two seem like total opposites?

true that.

i mean, a guardian missing either vibe is straight weak; but combining both seems like an impossible meme hack—so one might think that leveling up as a top-tier guardian is, like, a total myth.

fr, he admitted, "i’m lowkey scared that you’re absolutely right."

feeling hella confused, i started to re-evaluate the whole convo. "my dude," i said, "no surprise we’re in a total state of confusion—cuz we kinda lost the original vibe we started with, ya feel?"

he was like, "what you even mean, bro?"

i meant to drop that real talk: there are peeps out there pre-gifted with that wild combo vibe.

and like, where do we scoop these legend-status natures, huh?

i fired back, "check it: plenty of animals show us how it’s done. take the dog, for example—these high-key well-bred pups are super chill with their fam and squad, but go savage on strangers."

dude, i know that, fr.

so basically, finding a guardian with that combo is totally valid and natural, right?

for sure, not impossible.

and hold up—a guardian, besides being lit with spirit, should also come with mad philosopher vibes, right?

i’m not really catchin’ your drift, bro.

i clarified, "bro, that trait is also something you peep in dogs, and it’s straight iconic in how they roll."

which trait though?

like, yo, ever notice how a dog gets all heated when a stranger shows up but gives mad love when its homie drops by—even if the stranger never did anything shady and the buddy never did any good? pretty wild, right?

i never really peeped that before, but i gotta admit, your point’s pretty spot on.

and like, that doggy instinct is hella charming—your pupper is basically a lowkey philosopher, no lie.

why’s that, though?

cuz, see, the dog basically peels faces based solely on whether it vibes with you or not. shouldn't every creature be all about that learning life, deciding its faves based on what's known versus what's unknown?

oh for sure, 100%.

and like, isn't lovin' to learn basically lovin' wisdom, aka philosophy?

they're basically on the same vibe, he clapped.

so, can we not, with full drip, say that a dude who’s chill with his squad is naturally a wisdom and knowledge aficionado?

facts—you can bet on that.

so that means a legit epic and noble city guardian’s gotta combo that dope mix of philosophy, spirit, mad speed, and beast strength, right?

no cap—undoubtedly.

so, we've scoped out our ideal peeps; but now that we found them, how do we vibe up their education and rearing? isn't this like a major deets drop on the ultimate quest—how do justice and injustice level up in states? cuz we ain't tryna miss any lit points or drag this convo into endless scroll.

adeimantus was like, "this question is gonna be a major glow-up for our game, trust."

so i told him, my dude, we can’t just yeet this task—even if it’s a mega long haul.

100%, definitely not.

so let’s kick back, chill for an hour droppin' epic stories, and let our tale be the ultimate schooling for our future legends.

yasss, let’s get it.

so like, what’s the education recipe? can we vibe with anything better than the classic drip? cuz it splits into two major tracks: gym class for that body glow-up and music—like tunes for the soul.

facts, true that.

shall we kick off with some sweet beats and then hit the gym for that body flex?

hella yes.

and when you say music, you vibin' on lit too or nah?

i mean, totally.

and literature can be either vibe-true or totally fake?

yeah, for real.

and the kiddos gotta get schooled in both, but do we kick off with the faux tales?

he was like, "i ain't catchin' your drift here, bro."

i was like, "listen up, we start by droppin' stories for kids that might have some truth tea but are mostly made-up, and we serve these up while they're too young to hit gym class hard."

facts, totally on point.

that was my vibe when i said we gotta school 'em on music vibes before all that heavy gym hype.

he was like, "yeah, straight facts."

you also know the start of any project is the ultimate key drop—especially for young, tender things; that's when the squad’s character gets built and that epic impression lands way easier.

no doubt, facts.

and are we really gonna let kids soak up any random, throwaway stories cooked up by random peeps, planting ideas that are like total opposites of what we want their adult vibes to be?

nah fam, we cannot.

so, step one is to set up a lit censorship system for fiction writers, where the censors only let the dope stories fly and yeet the wack ones; and we gotta have moms and caretakers only sharing the approved recaps with the kiddos. let them shape their minds with those epic vibes, even more intensely than they flex on their bodies—but honestly, most of today's tales gotta bounce.

he asked, "which tales you even talkin' about, bro?"

i was like, "yo, the lesser tales reflect the big ones—they both come from the same vibe and share that same spirit, no cap."

he was like, "for sure, but i’m still lowkey confused on what you call the big ones exactly."

i said, "those are the legends spun by homer, hesiod, and the other og poets who've been mankind’s ultimate storytellers since day one."

he was like, "but which stories are you on about, and what's the big tea on their flaws?"

i dropped, "the mega diff is that they be spitting straight lies, and not just any lies—they're servin' up some seriously toxic bs."

but like, when does this epic fail occur?

basically whenever they flex a sketch of gods and heroes that’s totally off—like an artist drawing a portrait with zero vibe of the original masterpiece.

he was like, "yeah, that kind of vibe is totally trash; but which stories you even mean, bro?"

i started, "first off, there's that mega lie straight out of the high towers, where the poet dished on uranus—yeah, hesiod’s wild story about what uranus did and how cronus was like, 'bet, i'm gonna clock you.' even if cronus’s drama and his son’s savage payback were lowkey true, they shouldn’t be casually served up to young, clueless peeps; ideally, just keep that tea locked down. but if you absolutely gotta drop that mystery drop, only a chosen few should peep it, and they gotta sacrifice not some basic eleusinian pig, but like, a massive, legendary, un-findable beast—so only the real ones get in on the secret tea."

he was like, "yeah, no cap, those stories are straight-up massive cringe."

i was like, "amen, adeimantus—they're tales that should never drop in our state; our dudes shouldn't get the message that doing the worst crimes is like, no big deal, or that callin' out your old man on bein' wack is just mimicry of the og god moves."

he straight-up agreed, "i'm totally with you—those stories are not even on the menu for retweetin'."

and also, if we want our future guardians to see internal beef as totally trash, we shouldn't be droppin' any tea about celestial wars or gods schemin', cuz that's all bogus. nah, we ain't ever gonna drop battle recaps of giants or stitch those sagas on their drip; we gotta stay muted on endless godly feuds among buddies and fam. if they’d just vibe with us, we'd say, "yo, squabblin' is unholy," and that there’s literally never been any beef among citizens. that’s the vibe our OGs—old heads—should first school the kiddos on, and later, poets gotta write in that same tone. but those wild stories about hephaestus strappin' his mom down, or the time zeus yeeted him for defending her, and all those god wars in homer—nah, those tales are outright banned in our state, whether they’re deep allegories or not. cuz a young brain can’t even tell what’s metaphor and what’s literal; whatever they soak up at that age sticks like a permanent meme watermark. so it's crucial the first stories they hear are pure, epic role models of virtue.

he was like, "facts, but if any cat asks, 'where do we peep these ideal models and which tales are you spillin'?' how do we even answer that?"

i said, "bro, you and i right now aren’t just poets—we’re the og founders of this state. founders need to know the blueprint of how poets should flex their stories and the boundaries that gotta be maintained, but creatin' the stories isn’t on us."

he was like, "facts, but what exactly are these theology forms you’re on about?"

i replied, "think of it like this—god should always be dropped as he really is, no matter if it’s in an epic, lyric, or tragic style."

right on.

and like, isn’t he the ultimate good boi? shouldn’t he always be shown as such?

absolutely.

and literally, no good thing ever hurts, right?

nope, for real.

and what ain’t hurt, stays harmless, no cap?

definitely not.

and if it doesn’t hurt, it ain’t evil, yeah?

nah.

and can something that’s all good be the reason for evil, fam?

impossible, straight up.

and the good stuff is totally a major plus, right?

100%, yes.

so it’s like, the secret sauce for all that well-being?

yep.

so basically, the good only drops good vibes—it’s not behind every single thing, just the top-tier goods, right?

word, assuredly.

so like, if god is truly good, then he ain’t behind every lil’ thing like everyone says—he’s only the mastermind for the really dope stuff, not most of what hits humanity. c’mon, there’s only a couple of lit perks in human life and tons of burns, so the good vibes come solely from god, while the evils get their receipts from somewhere else, not him.

he was like, "that’s fact, most true that is."

then we can’t vibe with homer or any other poet who goes full cringe by spitting lines like:

  "lie at the threshold of zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots,"

and that if zeus mixes them,

  "sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;"

but if you get the cup of pure bad juju,

  "him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth."

and again—

  "zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us."

and if some fool claims that breakin' oaths and treaties—which was really pandarus’s move—was actually sparked by athene and zeus, or that all that godly drama was kicked off by themis and zeus, then zero respect, my dude; plus, we ain’t lettin’ our young bros catch aeschylus say, "god plants guilt among men when he’s dead set on wreckin' a house." and if a poet starts dishing on niobe’s sufferin’—from that tragic iambic drop—or on the house of pelops, or on the trojan war, or any similar theme, we either don’t let him claim these are god’s works, or if they are, he’s gotta spin a legit explanation that vibes with our search for truth; he must say god did what was righteous and it only made things more epic by droppin' punishment—but then admit that the punished are straight-up miserable and that god can’t be credited with causin' their misery. the poet is totally blocked from sayin' otherwise; sure, he can note that the wicked get their l's cuz they deserve punishment and might even benefit from that divine hammer drop, but sayin' that god, bein' all good, is behind evil for anyone is a major no-go, and that kind of fake news is suicidal, ruinous, and hella impious.

he was like, "i totally agree, i'm down to sign off on that law."

so let this be one of our core rules when it comes to the gods, fam—our poets and reciters gotta stick to the vibe that god ain't the creator of everything, just the source of pure good.

he was like, "that’s dope, that works."

and what about a second rule? can i ask, do you think god is like a mad magician who pulls shape-shifts outta nowhere—showing up in all kinds of forms, sometimes trickin' us with these epic transformations; or is he one and done, locked into his forever epic original form?

he was like, "bro, i need a sec to vibe on that before i drop an answer."

i replied, "look, if anything's gonna change, it’s either the thing doing its own glow-up or some external force messin' with it, ya feel?"

most definitely, no cap.

and like, stuff vibin' at its peak is the least likely to get wrecked; like, when a human’s at their healthiest and strongest, they ain’t easily messed up by food or drinks, and a plant in full blossom barely gets shook by winds or savage sun heat—that’s just facts, fam.

of course.

and wouldn’t the bravest, wisest soul be totally unbothered by any external bs?

totally true.

and i’m guessing the same rule goes for all composite stuff—furniture, houses, clothes: if they’re on point quality, they basically don’t get wrecked by time or life’s curveballs.

very true, no cap.

so basically, any good thing—whether crafted by artsy hands or natural vibes, or both—is the least likely to be messed up by external forces?

true.

but fr, god and all his divine creations are, like, perfect in every way, right?

of course they are, straight up.

so god can hardly be pushed by any outside bs to flip into different shapes?

he’s not gonna, no way.

but could he, like, decide to glow up or transform himself at all?

clearly, he was like, "if change happens at all, it can only be a self-initiated glow-up."

and if he does switch it up, will it be a major upgrade for beauty or just a downgrade into a rougher look?

if god ever changes, it’d only drop his level—because we can’t honestly think he’s ever been lacking in virtue or that epic beauty, right?

very true, adeimantus; but really, who in their right mind—god or mortal—would wanna downgrade and make themselves worse?

impossible, bro.

so it’s like, god will literally never be down to change, cuz he’s supposed to be the ultimate, most flawless version possible—like every god stays 100% locked in their own epic form forever, no cap.

that straight-up follows logically, he said, in my judgment.

then i said, "my dear friend, no poet should ever be allowed to flex that the gods, sneakin' around in weird stranger disguises, strut through cities in all sorts of random forms;" and no one is gonna trash proteus or thetis, nor should any poet—whether in tragedy or any other vibe—drop lines like someone in priestess cosplay beggin' for alms, sayin', "for the life-givin' daughters of inachus of the argos river;" like, we’re not about that fake hype. also, we can’t let moms influenced by these poets scare their kids with messed-up myth versions—spoutin' that certain gods "roll around at night in random stranger looks and in all kinds of forms;" cuz that only turns our kiddos into scaredy-cats while dissin' the gods.

he was like, "heaven forbid, bro."

but even though gods are totally unchangeable, could it be that through some witchcraft or straight-up deception they trick us into thinkin' they're switchin' forms?

maybe, he replied.

but can you really imagine that god would ever be down to lie, either in words or actions, or even send a phony ghost of himself around?

he was like, "i can’t really say, i’m not feelin' that vibe."

i said, "don't you know that the true lie—if we can even drop that term—is despised by both gods and humans alike?"

he was like, "what you mean by that, bro?"

i meant that no one wants to get their core, real self or their highest truths messed with by a lie; that's the one thing they fear infiltrating their whole being.

still, he said, "i just don’t get what you're on about, bro."

i explained, "look, you're readin' super deep into my words, but i'm just sayin' that deception—being duped about the highest truths in your inner self, your soul, and letting a lie stick there—is what people are most majorly not about; they straight up hate it, like, hardcore."

there’s literally nothing more cringey to them.

and like, as i was sayin', that deep ignorance in someone’s soul once they've been duped is what i'd call the real lie; cuz a lie in words is just a lame imitation—a shadow of a past soulful vibe, not pure, unfiltered falsehood. right?

exactly right.

so the true lie gets downright despised by both gods and dudes, right?

yes.

meanwhile, a lie in words can actually be super useful and not all bad; like when you're dealin' with haters—or when your so-called friends go off in a fit of wild madness and are about to do some harm—then that lie can serve as, like, a remedy or a preemptive fix. also, in those myth vibes we were chattin' about—since the real tea on ancient times is lowkey a mystery, we mash up falsehoods to look as real as possible and turn that to our advantage.

he said, "that's mad true."



but can any of these reasons even apply to god? like, are we supposed to think he’s so clueless about the ancient vibes that he ends up straight-up inventing stuff, no cap?

bruh, that would be totally absurd, he said.

so then, does that mean the lying poet has no spot in our god squad?

i’d say nah.

or maybe he drops a lie just ‘cause he’s shook by haters?

that is totally unthinkable.

but what if he’s rolling with friends who are, like, totally cray or extra?

no way—no mad or senseless person can be down as a friend of god.

so there’s literally zero reason for god to cap?

none whatsoever.

so does that mean our superhuman, divine bae is absolutely incapable of any fake energy?

yaaaass.

so god is, like, perfectly simple and 100% real in word and deed; he never switches up, never yeets anyone with fake vibes—neither by sign nor word, by dream or fully woke vision.

“your thoughts,” he said, “reflect mine.”

you’re on the same page then, i said, that this is the second style in which we should spill the tea about divine things. the gods aren’t no magic chameleons who flip modes on us, nor do they ever ghost humanity with deception.

i vibe with that.

—

then, even though we stan homer, we’re not here for that lying dream that zeus dished out to agamemnon; and we sure ain’t gonna hype up the verses from aeschylus where thetis claims that apollo at her nuptials

  ‘was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long, and to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. and i thought that the word of phoebus, being divine and full of prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has slain my son.’

these kinds of vibes about the gods are pure trigger material; whoever drops them gets benched from the chorus, and we won’t let teachers use that trash to school the young—‘cause our guardians, as human as they get, need to be 100% real worshippers of the gods, on their level.

i’m totally down with that, he said, and promised to lock it in as his own law.

—

book iii.

so like, these are our god-level theology principles—some stories get to be told, while others are totally ghosted from our young disciples, if we want them to give mad props to the gods and their parents and to keep that squad loyalty on point.

yeah; and i think our principles are straight fire, he said.

but if our squad is meant to be courageous, don’t they need to learn extra life hacks beyond these—lessons that totally wipe away that death anxiety? can any dude be brave if he’s constantly shook about dying?

deadass not, he said.

and can someone ever vibe as fearless of death, or will he choose an epic death in battle over a lame defeat and living in servitude, especially if he thinks the underworld is a legit horror show?

impossible, period.

so we gotta put the narrators of these tales on lockdown—not just letting them bash the underworld, but also pushing them to hype it up a bit, hinting that their wild descriptions are all cap and will seriously mess with our future warrior vibes.

that’s gonna be our duty, he said.

so, i said, we’ll have to yeet a bunch of obnoxious passages, starting with the verses,

  ‘i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought.’

we also gotta delete that verse where pluto is all shook,

  ‘lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen both of mortals and immortals.’

and again:—

  ‘o heavens! verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all!’

then again, from tiresias:—

  ‘(to him even after death did persephone grant mind,) that he alone should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.’

again:—

  ‘the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades, lamenting her fate, leaving manhood and youth.’

again:—

  ‘and the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth.’

and,—

  ‘as bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of them has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved.’

and we must beg homer and the other poets not to get salty if we strike out these and similar passages—not ‘cause they’re unpoetical or offbeat for the masses, but 'cause the extra poetic charm actually makes them unfit for the ears of youth who are meant to be free and should fear being boxed in more than death.

no cap.

also, we gotta reject all those super creepy names that describe the underworld—cocytus and styx, ghostly figures under the earth, lifeless shades, and any similar words that make anyone’s soul shudder. i’m not saying these spooky stories are totally useless; but they risk making our guardians way too extra and soft.

that’s a real danger, he said.

then, we must have zero of that.

true.

we gotta come up with a fresh, nobler vibe to be composed and sung by us.

obviously.

and should we ditch the endless sob stories of famous peeps?

they’re gonna get yeeted with the rest.

but is it cool to toss them? think: our rule is that a truly good dude won’t see death as a mega tragedy for his homie.

yass, that’s the vibe.

so he won’t end up getting all emo over his departed friend like he’s been through a major L?

he won’t.

such a dude is solid on his own, so he doesn’t even need extra hype from others.

true, he said.

and for that reason, losing a son or brother, or even taking an L in fortune, is totally the least tragic loss ever for him.

assuredly.

therefore, he’s way less likely to be bawling and will take any misfortune with mad equanimity.

yup, he’ll shrug off that L way better than most.

so we’re totally legit in ditching the famous man-complaints and passing them off to women (and not even the ones who bring any value) or to lower-tier dudes—so our future defenders won’t catch that whiny vibe.

that’s mad right.

then, we’ll once again beg homer and the other poets not to depict achilles—the goddess’s son—as first lying on his side, then on his back, then on his face; then suddenly bouncing up and sailing in a total frenzy along the barren shore; then scooping sooty ashes in both hands and drenching his head, or going full cry-mode in all the various ways homer has detailed. nor should he describe priam, the god-kin, as praying and calling out,

  ‘rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.’

even more, we’ll plead with him to ditch any scenes of the gods lamenting and saying,

  ‘alas! my misery! alas! that i bore the bravest to my sorrow.’

but if he must drop the gods into the mix, at the very least don’t let him misrepresent the greatest of them all by having him say—

  ‘o heavens! with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful.’

or even:

  woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon, dearest of men to me, subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius.

’cause if, my sweet adeimantus, our youth end up taking these unworthy portrayals of the gods seriously instead of laughing them off like they should, hardly anyone will think that, being only human, they can be disrespected by similar antics; nor will they shut down any sketchy impulses to do the same. instead of having any real guts or self-control, they’ll be left whining and crying over the tiniest L's.

yeah, he said, that’s so on point.

i replied, yes; but that’s exactly what shouldn’t fly, as the argument just proved to us; and we gotta stick to that proof until someone drops a better one.

it just ain’t allowed.

and our guardians shouldn’t be caught up in uncontrollable laughter either. because getting too much of a laugh attack almost always sparks off a wild reaction.

i believe that, for sure.

so, worthy peeps—even if just mortal—should never be shown as losing it to laughter, and even less should our gods be depicted as cracking up.

especially not the gods, as you say, he replied.

so we won’t allow any of that nonsense about the gods the way homer describes when he says

  ‘inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion.’

according to your views, we ain’t admitting that.

on my views—if you wanna throw shade at me—it’s 100% certain we can’t allow it.

again, truth should be the ultimate flex; if, like we said, a lie has zero use for the gods and only works as a kind of remedy for mortals, then that remedy should only be in the hands of docs—regular folks have no business with that shiz.

clearly not, he said.

so if anyone’s gonna get the free pass to lie, it should only be the state rulers; and they, in dealing with enemies or their own squad, may drop lies for the public good. nobody else should be allowed to mess with that trade; and even though rulers have that privilege, if a regular dude tries to lie back to them it’s a way bigger no-no—like a patient not telling the truth about his own body issues to the doc, or a gym rat failing to spill the tea on his own gains, or a sailor not giving the captain the real deets about the ship and his crew.

most true, he said.

so if the ruler catches anyone besides himself fibbing in the state—

  ‘any of the craftsmen, whether he be priest or physician or carpenter,’

he’s gonna hit them with punishment for introducing a practice that messes up the whole ship and state vibe.

most certainly, he said, if our state idea ever goes live.

next up, our youth gotta be temperate, right?

certainly.

isn’t the whole point of temperance pretty much about obeying your commanders and keeping it under control when it comes to sensory indulgences?

true.

then we’re cool with language like that of diomede in homer,

  ‘friend, sit still and obey my word,’

plus the follow-up lines,

  ‘the greeks marched breathing prowess, ...in silent awe of their leaders,’

and all the same vibes.

we shall.

what about this line,

  ‘o heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag,’

and the words that follow? would you say that these, or any similar disrespectful jabs that regular peeps are supposed to throw at their rulers—whether in verse or straight talk—are on point or totally off?

they’re totally off.

they might get a few laughs, but they don’t build real temperance, and so they’re likely to mess with our youth’s mindset—you with me?

yes.

and then, again, for the wisest to claim that nothing is more glorious than

  ‘when the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups,’

is that the kinda flex that actually boosts temperance for a young dude? or the verse

  ‘the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?’

what about that story of zeus, who—while all the other gods and men were catching z’s—was the only one up, scheming like a boss, but then his lust totally scrambled his plans, and he got so shook by here’s looks that he wouldn’t even step into her hut, just wanting to lay with her on the ground, declaring he’d never been in such a state of rapture before, not even when they first met

  ‘without the knowledge of their parents;’

or that other tea about how hephaestus, thanks to similar drama, chained up ares and aphrodite?

indeed, he said, i’m hella convinced that our youth should never get stuck on that kind of trash.

but any epic feats of endurance done or told by legendary peeps—that they should see and hear; for example, what’s dropped in the verses,

  ‘he smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!’

certainly, he said.

next, we must not let these youngins be all about receiving gifts or chasing money.

definitely not.

and we can’t be singing about

  ‘gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.’

nor should we hype up phoenix, achilles’ tutor, as having given dope advice when he told his pupil he should grab the greeks’ gifts and help them out—saying that without a gift he should keep his anger locked in. nor will we buy the idea that achilles was so money-obsessed that he took agamemnon’s gifts, or that when he got paid he returned hector’s body, but wouldn’t do so without the cash.

undoubtedly, he said, these vibes just aren’t cool.

i love homer, but i really can’t front that by blaming achilles or believing these feelings are truly his—i mean, that’s straight-up impiety. i can’t even buy the story of his insolence toward apollo, where he goes,

  ‘thou hast wronged me, o far-darter, most abominable of deities. verily i would be even with thee, if i had only the power;’

or his major disrespect toward the river-god, whose divinity he’s ready to throw down on; or his offering of his own hair to the dead patroclus—which had already been dedicated to the river-god spercheius—and that he actually pulled through on that vow; or that he dragged hector around patroclus’ tomb and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; i just can’t believe he was guilty of that, any more than i can let our citizens think that he—the wise cheiron’s pupil, the son of a goddess and of peleus (the gentlest of men and third in line from zeus)—was ever so scrambled in his head as to be down with two totally clashing vibes, petty meanness (not even free from greed) mixed with straight-up disdain for gods and men.

you’re on point, he replied.

and let’s also refuse to buy or spread the tale of theseus, son of poseidon, or of peirithous, son of zeus, going out to commit a horrid rape; or of any other hero or god’s son supposedly pulling off such impious and dreadful moves as they falsely credit them with these days—and let’s force the poets to declare either that these acts never went down or that these dudes aren’t really sons of gods; in either case, they’re never allowed to drop both claims in one breath. we won’t have them convincing our youth that the gods are behind all evil, and that heroes are no better than mere mortals—sentiments that, as we said, are neither pious nor true, since we already proved that no evil comes from the gods.

assuredly not.

and further, such tales will seriously mess with anyone who hears them—everyone will start making excuses for their own vices when they’re convinced that similar wickedness is always being dropped by

  ‘the kindred of the gods, the relatives of zeus, whose ancestral altar, the altar of zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of ida,’

and who got

  ‘the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.’

so let’s put a hard stop to these tales, or they’ll totally loosen up the morals of our youth.

by all means, he replied.

but now that we’re laying down which topics are cool or not cool to talk about, let’s see if we missed any. how to treat the gods, demigods, heroes, and the underworld has already been set.

very true.

so what about mortals? that’s clearly the last piece of our vibe.

clearly so.

but right now, we’re not in the mood to answer that, my friend.

why not?

because, if i’m not mistaken, we gotta say that when it comes to mortals, poets and storytellers are the ones who seriously mess up by saying that wicked dudes are always happy and the good are forever miserable; that injustice pays off when it flies under the radar, but justice is just one man’s loss and another’s gain—this is the stuff we’re banning them from spitting, and we’ll force them to drop the opposite message.

for sure we will, he replied.

but if you agree that i’m right, then i gotta say you just dropped the principle we’ve been fighting for all along.

i grant that inference is on point.

whether such stuff should or shouldn’t be said about mortals is a question we can’t answer until we figure out what justice really is, and just how naturally beneficial it is to the one who rocks it—whether he seems just or not.

most true, he said.

enough about poetry topics—let’s talk style; and once we break that down, both what we say and how we say it will be 100% sorted.

i don’t even get what you mean, said adeimantus.

then i gotta break it down for you; maybe i’ll be clearer if i put it like this. you know, all mythology and poetry is basically just a retelling of events—past, present, or future, right?

certainly, he replied.

and a narrative can either be simple telling, straight-up imitation, or a mix of both?

that, he said, i don’t quite catch yet.

i fear i’m coming off as a goofy teacher if i can’t make myself clear. so, like a clumsy speaker, i won’t cover the whole topic—i’ll just break off a piece to show my point. you know the opening lines of the iliad, where the poet says that chryses begged agamemnon to free his daughter, and agamemnon flipped out; and then chryses, failing his mission, invoked the wrath of the god against the acheans?

now, about these lines,

  ‘and he prayed all the greeks, but especially the two sons of atreus, the chiefs of the people,’

the poet is straight-up speaking in his own voice; he never makes you think he’s anyone else. but after that, he channels chryses, doing everything to make us believe the speaker isn’t homer but the old priest himself. in this double flex, he drops the entire narrative of what went down at troy, in ithaca, and throughout the odyssey.

yes.

and the narrative stays intact in both the speeches the poet drops from time to time and in the in-between parts?

quite true.

but when the poet raps in someone else’s voice, can we say he’s matching his style to that person’s vibe, the one he tells you is about to spit?

certainly.

and this style mimicry—whether by voice or gesture—is just the imitation of that character’s own swagger?

of course.

so in that case, the poet’s narrative basically rolls out via imitation?

very true.

or, if the poet be flexing his presence everywhere and never sliding into stealth mode, then guess what, fam? the whole imitation vibe gets yeeted and his poetry turns into straight-up storytime, no cap. but to keep things crystal and avoid any “i don’t get it” moments, imma show you how to flip the switch. if Homer had dropped a line like, “the priest rolled up carrying his daughter’s ransom, straight up supplicating the acheans and especially the big-time kings;” and instead of chatting in Chryses mode he just went off as himself, then boom—the spit would be pure narrative, not that shady mimicry. the flow would’ve gone like this (i’m not about that poetic meter game, so imma bail on that): “the priest rolled up and threw a prayer to the gods for the greeks to snatch troy and get home safe, while begging to have his daughter returned, to scoop up his ransom, and to dish respect to the god. so he dropped those vibes, and the other greeks gave him mad props and were like, ‘on god, bet.’ but Agamemnon got heated and ordered him to bounce and never come back, ‘cause otherwise the god’s swag—like his staff and fancy chains—would be useless. no daughter free ride, he insisted—she’d just end up aging with him in Argos. then he said, “beat it and don’t provoke me if you wanna keep your skin intact.” and the old guy dipped in ghost mode, scared and silent, and once he cleared the camp, he hit up Apollo using all his handles, dropping reminders of every lit move he’d done—from temple builds to sacrifice flexes, praying that his good karma gets paid back and that the acheans would soak up his tears with god’s arrow rain”—and so it goes. in this way, the whole thing straight-up becomes narrative.

i gotchu, he said.

or maybe you’re like, “nah, let’s just cut the middleman and keep the dialogue only, fam.”

he said, “same vibes, i totally feel that; you’re talkin’ like how it goes in tragedy, right?”

you totally got my meaning; and if i’m not mistaken, what you didn’t catch earlier is now crystal—poetry and myth, sometimes, are all about straight-up imitation, like in tragedy and comedy where you’re basically copying the vibe. then there’s the flip side where the poet’s the solo act—dithyramb is the ultimate example of that—and when you mix both, you get epic and a bunch of other poetic drop-offs. you rollin’ with me?

“yeah, i see what you mean now,” he fired back.

and remember what i dropped at the start—we wrapped the subject, so now we're leveling up to the style, squad.

“yep, i remember that vibe,” he responded.

basically, i was hinting that we gotta figure out the rules for that mimic game—like, should we let poets drop imitations when telling their stories, and if so, are they allowed to mimic everything or just certain moves? or should we be like, “nah fam, no imitations allowed” altogether?

“so you’re asking if we should even let tragedy and comedy crash our state?”

“exactly,” i replied; “but trust, there’s more layers to this. i don’t know the full tea yet, but wherever the convo takes us, we're riding that wave.”

“bet, we’re going all in,” he answered.

so, Adeimantus, lemme hmu with this question: should our guardian squad be imitators? or ain’t we already lit with that rule that one peep can only boss one game at a time, and if he tries juggling too many, he ends up being a total noob with zero rep?

for sure, he shrugged.

and this holds for imitation too—like no guy can perfectly mimic a bunch of vibes as cleanly as he can nail just one, right?

absolutely cannot.

so it’s basically impossible for one dude to be a major player in life while also being a jack-of-all-trades in imitation— even when two styles are close, the same folks can’t slay both. like, think about the tragedians and comedists—didn’t you just tag them as imitations?

“yeah, i said that; you're spot on thinking one can't rock both lanes,” he agreed.

like, just as no one can be a rhapsodist and an actor at the same time, right?

true that.

and comic and tragic actors aren’t even cut from the same cloth; but yo, it’s all just imitation vibes.

yup, that's facts.

and look, Adeimantus, human nature itself is like chopped into tiny bits—it just can't handle imitating a load of stuff well, any more than it can nail the actual actions that those imitations are supposed to be copies of.

“deadass, that's on point,” he replied.

so real talk: if we stick to our original plan—where our guardians are all-in on keeping freedom lit in our state, dedicating every second to that hustle and not doing any side gigs—then they shouldn’t be practicing other imitations at all. and if they gotta mimic, they should only flex, from young age onward, the vibes that match their gig—the brave, the chill, the pure, the free, etc. no jousting with sketchy or lame vibes, or else they’ll end up becoming that garbage. ever peep how habits start in early youth and grind on so long they become a second skin for body, voice, and mind?

“fact, i’ve seen that for sure,” he said.

i continued, “then we’re not letting our peeps—those we claim are meant to be good guys—dip into imitating women, whether the young or old, whether she’s throwing shade at her man, flexing too hard against the gods about her own happiness, or when she’s low, sad, or bawling. and definitely not someone who’s in his sick, love, or grind mode.”

“for sure, that’s right,” he agreed.

should they also ever mimic slaves—dudes or dudettes doing their slave grind?

nah, they gotta not do that.

and obviously not sketchy dudes, whether they’re fronting as cowards or any other lame types, who flip the script on what we just laid down, dissing each other while boozed up or not, or who basically mess up their vibe with themselves and the squad in any way. nor should they ever be schooled into mimicking the moves or words of crazy or evil peeps; cuz madness, like bad vibes, is meant to be observed—not copied.

“no doubt, that's facts,” he replied.

and they ain’t allowed to mimic craftsmen, smiths, oarsmen, boatswains, or any of that crafty biz, right?

“how they gonna do that when we never gave them the license to vibe with those trades?” he shot back.

and they’re not gonna be copying horse whinnies, bull roars, river murmurs, ocean rolls, thunder sounds, and all that nature-based noise either, right?

“nah fam, if you’re banning madness, you gotta block copying mad peeps too,” he answered.

so, if i’m reading you right, you got two narrative vibes: one that a straight-up good dude drops when he’s got something to say, and another one that some opposite character with a different education uses, right?

“so which two styles you talkin’ about?” he asked.

“imagine this: a righteous, good guy, while telling a story, comes across some dope quote or move from another upstanding dude—I bet he'd vibe with that and not be trippin’ about imitating it. he'd be all in to play the role of the good guy when he's on that solid, wise grind; maybe less so if he's down with sickness, love, or drunk fails, or any other mess. but if he faces a persona that’s totally not his jam, he wouldn’t even bother studying it; he'd straight-up shun that vibe and only mimic it for a hot sec if he's doing something commendable. otherwise, he'd get embarrassed to act out a role he's never flexed, and he wouldn't wanna mold himself after those low-tier models—i mean, he thinks that kind of mimic game, unless for a joke, is beneath his level, and just the thought of it gives him major cringe.”

“i totally feel it,” he replied.

so basically, he’d go with a narration mode like Homer’s drop—mixing in a bit of imitation with mostly straight storytelling; you feel me?

“hell yeah, that’s the only way a speaker can roll,” he confirmed.

but then, there's also that character who’ll narrate anything, and honestly, the more trash he is, the more shameless he'll be—nothing's too extra for him. he’s down to mimic anything, not as a meme, but for real, fronting it in front of a crowd. like i was saying, he'll try to mimic the roll of thunder, the clout of wind and hail, or even the creaks of wheels and pulleys, and every sound drop from flutes, pipes, trumpets, and whatever instruments—he'll bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a rooster; his whole gig is all about copying voices and moves, with barely any solid narration.

“exactly, that’s his whole spiel,” he said.

so, these are the two basic style flexes, right?

“yep.”

you’d also vibe with the idea that one style is all about that low-key, minimal change mode; if you pick harmony and rhythm for their chill simplicity, then a proper speaker stays pretty much on-point in his style, sticking to one vibe (since the tweaks are minor), and keeps using almost the same rhythmic flex.

“facts, straight up true,” he affirmed.

whereas the other style is like an all-out remix with wild harmonies and rhythms, if the music’s gotta match the style, since that style is packing a bunch of changes.

“i'm with you, that’s 100% true,” he replied.

and honestly, isn’t it that all poetry and every kinda wordplay falls into one of these two styles, or a mix of them? basically, no one can spit words unless they’re riding one lane or a collab of both.

“yep, they cover the whole spectrum,” he said.

so, are we gonna let in all three style vibes, or just stick to the two pure, unmixed ones? or maybe even the blended mix?

“i’d vote for just accepting the pure mimic of virtue,” i said.

“true,” i added, “Adeimantus, but gotta admit, the mixed style got its own charm. like, the full-on pantomime vibe—which is totally the opposite of what you’re about—is a huge hit with kids, their peeps, and basically everyone out there.”

i won’t lie, that's real.

but i bet you'll be like, “nah fam, that style just ain’t a fit for our state, where human nature is one-track, each dude only playing one role, ya know?”

“exactly, totally unsuitable,” he replied.

and that’s why in our state—and only in our state—a shoemaker sticks to shoes, not flying planes; a farmer is a farmer and not, like, a big business mogul; and a soldier stays soldier, not flipping into a trader—and it’s the same story all around, right?

“true that,” he said.

so, when some pantomime dude—one of those too-cool-to-be-true types who’s flexing that wild knack for imitating anything—rolls up and proposes to put on his poetry show, we'll be like, “we stan you, holy and awesome being!” but then we gotta drop the news that our state ain’t about that life for them; the law’s straight-up anti that vibe. so once we bless him with myrrh and crown him with that woolly garland, we’re gonna ship him out to another city. cuz we’re here to vibe with the raw, no-nonsense poet or storyteller—one who only mimics the virtues and sticks to the original models we set up when we started schooling our soldiers.

“for sure, if we got the juice,” he replied.

so now, my dude, i said, that segment of our literary ed—talkin’ stories and myths—is wrapped up, since we broke down the content and the style.

“yeah, i’m down with that,” he said.

next up on our playlist is melody and song.

obviously, fam.

everyone can see what the tea is on that, if we’re not about to contradict ourselves.

“i gotta say, laughing, the term ‘every one’ might not even cover me rn, cuz i’m kinda blank on what they should be, though i got some guesses,” Glaucon chuckled.

anyway, you can peep that a song or ode breaks down into three pieces—the words, the melody, and the rhythm; is that level of deets cool with you?

“for sure, that’s legit,” he confirmed.

and about the words, there’s no diff between the ones paired with a beat and those that aren’t; they gotta follow the same rules—rules we already set, right?

“yup,” he agreed.

so the melody and rhythm are basically riding off the words, correct?

“no doubt,” he replied.

remember when we dropped that, while discussing the subject, we don’t need all that extra moaning and sorrow in the musical strains?

“true that,” he agreed.

so, which harmonies are all about that sorrow vibe? you’re the musical whiz, so spill it.

the ones you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and that full-sounding or bass lydian, among others.

so i said, these beats gotta get the boot—even for the ladies who got their own drip, and def not for the dudes.

“straight up,” he agreed.

next up, being drunk, soft, and lazy is totally not the move for our guardian crew.

“mad not acceptable,” he affirmed.

so, which harmonies are known as the soft, boozy vibes?

“it’s the ionian and lydian—they’re basically dubbed as ‘chill,’” he answered.

and are those beats even useful in the military scene, though?

“nah, on the contrary,” he shot back; “if we need a battle vibe, then only dorian and phrygian are in the game.”

so i replied: look, i might not be a harmony expert, but i need one battle-ready vibe to drop that warlike tone—a note that a brave soul drops when danger’s knocking, when things are going south, or when he’s about to get wrecked, yet meets every bad beat with pure determination to keep going; and i need another vibe for those chill peace times when there ain’t pressure, and he’s out here persuading god with prayers, schooling folks with solid advice, or even showing his soft side by yielding to some entreaty. it’s that vibe when he reaches his goals without getting carried away by success but stays humble and wise. so, i’m asking you to ditch the extra strains—the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the unlucky and the lucky, the strain of courage, and the strain of temperance; drop those.

“those are basically the dorian and phrygian vibes i was spitting about,” he replied.

so, i said, if it's just these two harmonies in our jams, then we don’t need a crazy mashup of notes or a panharmonic scale, right?

“i guess not,” he agreed.

then, that means we’re not supporting those lyre makers with their triple-cornered, complex scales or any other stringed wizardry with super complex harmonies, right?

“definitely not,” he said.

but what about the flute squad—the makers and players? do we even let them in our state, when you think about it, since in this mix the flute is, like, worse than all those stringed instruments combined; even panharmonic jams are just a poor imitation of the flute?

“hell no,” he stated.

so, it boils down to only letting the lyre and the harp live in the city, while out in the sticks the shepherds can chill with a pipe.

that's clearly the endgame of our convo, i reckon.

i also noted that picking Apollo and his gear over Marsyas and his setup is totally logical.

“not even a bit,” he replied.

and so, by the dog of Egypt, without even realizing it, we've been cleansing our state—the one we not long ago called luxurious.

“and that was a genius move,” he said.

so, now let’s finish this cleanse, i said. next up, after harmonies, come rhythms—and they gotta follow the same playbook. we shouldn’t be chasing overly complex meter systems or every kind of meter out there, but rather discover the rhythms that shout out a brave, harmonious life; and once we nail them down, we’ll match the beat and melody with words that pulse the same energy—not the other way around. now, you gotta school me on what these rhythms are, just like you did with harmonies!

“but honestly, i can’t break it down for you,” he replied. “all i know is that there are like three core rhythm principles that form all metrical systems, kinda like how there are four notes in a tetrachord that make up every harmony. that’s just something i observed. but which vibes each of them truly imitates in life? i’m not really sure, fam.”

so then, i said, we gotta bring Damon into our circle; he'll drop the knowledge on what rhythms scream meanness, insolence, fury, or other cringeworthy vibes—and which ones are pure for expressing the opposite feels. i kinda recall him mentioning this gnarly complex cretic rhythm; also a dactylic, or heroic one, and he broke them down in a way i can’t fully decode—making the beats alternate long and short in perfect sync; and i think he even threw in details on iambic and trochaic rhythms, giving them short and long beats. sometimes he even appeared to vibe more with the movement of the beat rather than the rhythm itself, or maybe a mix of both; honestly, i’m not 100% sure what he was on about. anyway, these deets are best left to Damon ‘cause it gets hella complicated, ya dig? (Socrates was lowkey sketching over here, acting like he didn’t know all the nitty-gritty—in the first part dropping paeonic rhythms at a 3/2 ratio, then dactylic and anapaestic rhythms at a 1/1 ratio, and finally iambic and trochaic rhythms rocking a 1/2 or 2/1 ratio.)

“that’s on the money,” i replied.

but look, it’s super clear that having grace or being clumsy is straight-up the result of banging out a good or bad rhythm.

“no cap, none at all,” he agreed.

and also, solid or trash rhythm just vibes with good or bad style overall; similarly, harmony and discord fall in line with the style—basically, our main principle is that the words call the shots for rhythm and harmony, not the other way around.

“exactly, they gotta follow the words,” he confirmed.

and isn’t it that the words and the overall style are straight-up a reflection of one’s inner vibe or soul temperament?

“yep,” he said.

and basically, all of that style stuff?

“yes indeed,” he chimed in.

so, in the end, dope style, harmony, grace, and bomb rhythm come from pure simplicity—I’m talkin’ about the genuine, next-level simplicity of a properly ordered, noble mind and character, not that fake simplicity that’s just a fancy term for dumbass behavior?

“facts, that's 100% true,” he replied.

and if our young guns are gonna crush it in life, aren’t they supposed to be on a constant grind to lock in that style, those harmonies, and all that dope grace?

“they absolutely gotta,” he replied.

and no cap, the art of painters and every creative or building hustle is loaded with that vibe—whether it’s weaving, embroidery, architecture, or any kind of craft; even nature—every animal and plant—shows off that grace or its lack. ugliness, discord, and messy, off-beat motion are essentially the evil twins of bad words and shady nature, just like grace and harmony are the legit twin queens of goodness and virtue, repping the same look.

“i totally agree,” he said.

but so, are we just gonna police our squad’s vibes to only let poets flex that “good energy” in their work, and if they drop any extra cringe, they get straight yeeted outta our state? or you tryna extend that same rule to every creator out here—sculptors, builders, and all the arts—banning any display of shady vice, wild excess, mean energy, and basic indecency, so that anyone who can’t keep it 100 gets blocked from practicing their craft here, ‘cause we ain’t about our citizens catching bad vibes? we def don’t want our guardians growing up in a toxic meme garden full of moral deformities—like chillin’ in a noxious pasture, munching on nasty herbs and flowers day by day, slowly building a festering dumpster fire inside their soul. let our creators be those who can actually spot the real drip of beauty and grace; then our youth will live in a healthy vibe zone, surrounded by lit sights and sounds, soaking up nothing but the good, as beauty—the drip of fire works—flows into their eyes and ears like a fresh, health-giving breeze from a cleaner zone, subtly pulling their souls from day one into full-on homie mode with the beauty of reason.

that training is the sickest, no cap, he replied.

and so, i said, glaucon, getting crunk with music is a way stronger tool than anything else, ‘cause the rhythm and harmony slide right into the soul’s dm’s, locking in mad grace—making a well-educated soul hella graceful and an ill-educated one, sus and off-key; plus, the real ones who get this inner vibe will peep every glitch in art and nature, and with genuine taste, as they hype up and soak in the good, turning noble and dope, they’ll also call out the lame and hate the bad, even back in their early days before they can even explain why; and when reason finally shows up, they’ll nod to that homie who’s been with them since day one.

yes, he replied, i totally vibe with you that our youth gotta get tuned in to music and all that lit stuff you mentioned.

like, when we learned to read, we got hyped just by knowing the few letters of the alphabet in all their remix sizes and combos—not brushing them off as unimportant whether they show up big or small, but always tryna spot ‘em, and not flexing our reading game until we could peep them everywhere:

for real—

or, like, we only recognize letters in their water or mirror reflections ‘cause we know the real ones; that same grind of study gives us both:

facts—

even so, as i maintain, neither we nor our guardians—our crew to school up—can ever get that musical glow until we all know the core drip of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their whole squad, as well as the flip side of those in every remix, and can spot them wherever they pop up, no matter if it’s a small tea spill or a big move, ‘cause they’re all part of one epic art study.

no doubt, fam.

and when a lit soul clicks with a fire form, and they’re basically molded as one, that’s the dopest sight for anyone with eyes to see it?

straight up the dopest.

and the dopest is also the prettiest, then?

bet, we can assume that.

and a dude with harmony vibes will def fall for the prettiest, but he ain’t tryna vibe with someone whose soul is off-key, right?

true that, he replied, if the flaw’s in the soul; but if someone’s just rockin’ a minor bod glitch, he’ll be chill and still love ‘em.

i feel ya, i said—i know you’ve been through that, and i’m down with it. now, real talk: does an overdose of pleasure ever vibe with temperance?

how’s that even? he fired back; pleasure can totally rob a dude of his skills just as hard as pain.

or any links to virtue overall?

nah, none at all.

what about wild, unfiltered decadence?

hell yeah, that’s the ultimate.

and is there any pleasure more lit or wild than straight-up sensual love?

nah, nothing crazier.

meanwhile, true love is all about beauty and order—chill and on-beat, right?

deadass, he said.

so no unruly or cray pleasure should ever crash the true love party?

bet, definitely not.

so, no mad or out-of-control pleasure can ever slide into the DM’s of the lover duo if their vibe’s pure?

nah, for real, socrates, it should stay way outta their circle.

so i guess in our next-gen city, you’d drop a law saying that a friend should only vibe with his love like a dad vibes with his kid—and only for a noble cause, with full-on consent; this rule keeps all interactions in check, and if someone goes too far, they’re officially flagged for bad manners and cringe.

i totally vibe with that, he said.

that’s pretty much the tune, right? ‘cause what else should music drop if not the love of beauty?

i’m onboard, he said.

after that, it’s time for gym—our youth need to get drilled in the body hustle next.

fo sho.

both gym and music gotta start in the early years; the training should be precise and last a lifetime. here’s my take—and i wanna hear your vibe too—not that a banging bod automatically levels up the soul, but that a lit soul, through its own excellence, amps up the bod as much as possible. what you say?

facts, i vibe with that.

so once the mind is on fleek, we can hand off the nitty-gritty of body care; and to keep it short, i’ll just drop the general outline of the idea.

straight fire.

we already agreed that guardians gotta stay sober af; out of everyone, they should be the last to get lit and lost in the sauce.

preach, he said; for a guardian to need another guardian to hold him down is straight-up absurd.

but next up, what about grub? our dudes are training for the ultimate showdown, right?

yep, he said.

and do our regular athlete vibes even cut it for them?

why not, bro?

but fr, i gotta say, the typical athlete routine is kinda sleepy and low-key risky for health. don’t you peep how these athletes basically snooze through life, and if they even slightly stray from their daily grind, they get hit with some dangerous bugs?

facts, i see that.

so, i said, our warrior athletes need a next-gen training—like being as alert as livestream mod dogs, with eagle eyes and super-sharp ears; through all the wild water changes, food swaps, scorching summers, and icy winters during campaigns, they gotta be built tough to dodge any health breakdowns.

that’s my take.

the ultimate gym hustle is like the twin bro of that simple, chill music vibe we just dropped.

how come, tho?

like, i think there’s a gym routine that’s just as simple and dope as our music—especially military-style training.

what’s your angle?

look, my vibe is clear from homer; you know he dished out soldier grub to his heroes during campaigns—no fish even when chillin’ by the hellespont, and no boiled meats, only roast, which is the ultimate soldier snack that just needs a quick fire and skips the drama of pots and pans.

facts.

and i’m not tripping if i say homer never even drops sweet sauces. banning ‘em isn’t new; all pro athletes know that if you wanna stay in peak form, you gotta nix that sauce.

true that, he said; and hella right, they skip that sauce.

so you wouldn’t vibe with syracusan dinners or that fancy sicilian chef life, right?

nah, i don’t think so.

and if a dude’s tryna stay on fleek, you wouldn’t let him roll with a corinthian girl as his bae, right?

definitely not.

and you wouldn’t cop athenian sweets hyped as delicacies either?

no way.

all that gourmet livin’ is like dialing in on a panharmonic jam—smooth rhythms and pure vibes all the way.

preach.

where complexity breeds chaos and sickness, simplicity in music is the OG source of chill in the soul, and simplicity in gym brings boss-level health to the bod.

facts, he said.

but when wild vibes and illnesses spread in a state, you end up with new justice halls and med centers popping off; docs and lawyers start flexin’, ‘cause not just the NPCs but the whole city gets lowkey obsessed with ‘em.

obviously.

and honestly, what proves a state is hella trash in education more than when not only low-key artisans and basic peeps need top-tier docs and judges, but even those who claim they got a fancy, liberal education? isn’t it pure cringe and basic that a dude has to bounce outta his own crib to get law and med help ‘cause he’s got nada at home, basically handing over the remote to random big shots?

of everything, he said, that’s the most cringe.

would you say “most” when there’s even an extra cringe phase where a dude spends his whole life in court—either as plaintiff or defendant—and gets hyped on his own litigious hustle, thinking he’s the ultimate hack who can dodge justice like a bendy emoji, all just for petty points that ain’t even worth flexing about, not realizing that setting up his life to do without a snoozing judge is way higher level? isn’t that even more cringe?

yeah, he said, that’s even more mad cringe.

well, i said, and having to call in med help not when you’re hurt or during a legit outbreak, but just ‘cause, thanks to laziness and that offbeat lifestyle we’ve been vibin’ about, dudes end up filling themselves with water and wind like their bodies are swamps—forcing the genius sons of asclepius to coin new names for diseases like flatulence and catarrh—isn’t that super cringe too?

yeah, he said, they seriously be naming diseases like it’s the newest tiktok trend.

yeah, i said, and i don’t believe these cray diseases even existed back in asclepius’s day; like, check it—hero eurypylus, after getting wrecked in homer, chugs some pramnian wine all sprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese (definitely inflammatory), yet the asclepius squad at the trojan war didn’t even roast the girl who handed it over or call out patroclus for his care.

well, he said, that drink was hella extra for someone in that state.

not even that extra, i replied, if you remember that back in the day—like before herodicus—asclepius’s crew didn’t roll with our modern med system that basically trains up diseases. but herodicus, being a trainer and low-key sickly himself, mixed up training and doctoring to basically torture himself first and then the rest of us.

how so? he asked.

by coming up with lingering death; he had this mortal condition he constantly buzzed about, and since a glow-up was never in the cards, he spent his whole life as a hypochondriac, only caring for himself, and got major pain whenever he strayed from his routine—dying hard, yet science kept him hustling into old age.

that was a rare flex of his talent!

yeah, i said; it’s the kind of win a dude might expect if he never got that asclepius wasn’t schooling his fam in hypochondria—not ‘cause he was clueless, but ‘cause he knew that in a well-run state everyone’s got a grind to stick to, so they ain't got time to be forever sick. we see this with regular artisans, but weirdly enough, we don’t hold rich folks to the same standard.

what you mean? he asked.

i mean this: when a carpenter gets sick, he’s not tryna get a gourmet med plan—he just wants a quick fix like an emetic, purge, cautery, or even a slice; that’s his remedy. and if a doc tries to feed him a whole diet plan, telling him to wrap his head up like a burrito, he’s like, “i got no time for this sickness,” ‘cause life’s too short to nurse a disease over his usual hustle. so he ditches that doc, goes back to his grind, and either levels up and keeps hustling or, if his bod can’t keep up, he exits without extra drama.

facts, he said—and a dude in that hustle should only roll with medicine to that extent.

doesn’t he, i said, have a job? and what’s the point of living if you lose your hustle?

deadass, he said.

but with rich dudes, it’s different; we don’t say they got a specific grind they must keep up with if they wanna live.

they’re usually seen as having nada to do.

then you ain’t heard the phocylides line that says once you got a livelihood, you should practice virtue?

nah, he said, i think you should start way sooner.

so let’s not debate phocylides on this, i said; rather, let’s ask ourselves: is living virtuously a must for rich peeps, or can they slide without it? and if it’s a must, then doesn’t this constant body maintenance of disorders—which messes with your mind in carpentry and the mechanical arts—also block the phocylides vibe?

on that, he replied, no cap; too much body upkeep beyond gym rules seriously hinders living virtuous.

preach, i replied, and it’s not cool for running a house, an army, or any state office either; and most importantly, it totally clashes with deep study, thought, or self-reflection—everyone’s always suspecting that headaches and brain fog come from philosophy, so trying high-level virtue just gets blocked, ‘cause you’re constantly tripping that you’re getting sick and stressing over your bod.

facts, for sure.

and so, our woke asclepius only dropped his med magic on folks who were usually healthy but hit a specific snag; he’d cure ‘em with purges and ops, then tell them to bounce back to their usual grind—keeping the state’s interests in check; but if someone’s body was totally wrecked by disease, he wouldn’t even try a slow-mo fix. he wasn’t about prolonging trash lives or letting weak dads spawn even weaker kids; if you weren’t built for the everyday hustle, you weren’t worth the cure—‘cause that fix wouldn’t help you or the state anyway.

so, he said, you’re basically saying asclepius was a straight-up statesman.

obviously; and his character even shines brighter when you peep his sons. remember, these dudes were heroes back in the day, rockin’ that med game at the siege of troy—remember when pandarus wounded menelaus, and they

sucked the blood outta the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies—

but they never dished out advice on what the patient should munch or sip after, whether it was menelaus or eurypylus; the remedies, in their book, were enough to fix anyone who was hella healthy and had a regular vibe before getting wrecked; and even if a dude chugged a posset of pramnian wine, he’d bounce back just fine. but they straight-up ghosted on unhealthy and over-the-top trash subjects, whose lives were no good for themselves or anyone else; med art wasn’t designed for their level of cray, and even if they were loaded like midas, asclepius’s sons would just pass on 'em.

those asclepius sons were mad smart, fr.

naturally, i replied. still, the tragedians and pindar went off-script—although they admit asclepius was apollo’s son, they also say he got bribed to heal a rich dude on death’s door, and for that, he got struck by lightning. but we, staying true to our vibe, ain’t buying both sides—if he’s a god’s son, he can’t be a greedy simp; or if he’s greedy, then he ain’t divine.

all that, socrates, is lit; but here’s a question for you: shouldn’t our state have dope physicians, and ain’t the best ones those who’ve treated the most bodies, good or bad? and similarly, aren’t the top judges the ones who know all the different moral vibes?

yep, i said, i’m all for having fire judges and med docs. but you know who i think is truly good?

spill the tea.

i will, if i can. but first, note that you’re lumping together two totally different things here.

how so? he asked.

like, i said, you’re mixing up doctors and judges. the dopest med docs are those who, since day one, have stacked up mad experience with diseases along with their art; they shouldn’t be all robust and unbreakable, ‘cause if they were, they’d never have known what sickness is. they heal the bod with their mind, and a sick mind can’t cure a thing.

facts, he said.

but judges are a whole ‘nother story; since they run the mind game mind-to-mind, they shouldn’t have been raised among shady, evil peeps or soaked in criminal vibes from the jump—so they can easily spot others’ crimes like diagnosing a bod’s disease from their own experience; an honorable mind built for solid judgment should come up clean, with zero contamination of shady habits in its youth. and that’s why sometimes, young good dudes seem a bit basic and get played by the sneaky ones, ‘cause they haven’t seen what real evil looks like up close.

yes, he said, they get tricked way too easily.

so, i was like, look, the judge should def not be some young rookie; he gotta clock evil not by catching it in his own soul but by lowkey peeping how other folks get their hands dirty – knowledge should be his ride or die, not just his own cringe experience.

yep, he said, that's the ideal judge flex, no cap.

yup, i replied, and he’ll be a straight-up good dude (that’s my answer to your q) ‘cause if your soul’s lit, you’re all good.

but yo, that shady, sus vibe we were dissing – the dude who’s stacked with crimes and thinks he’s a boss at wickedness when he’s chillin’ with his crew – is extra with his precautions, ‘cause he sizes up others by checking himself first; but when he rolls with the old-school, virtuous homies, those seasoned peeps, he lowkey turns into a total clown ‘cause his extra suspicions are off the charts – he can’t peep an honest bro ‘cause he’s never sampled that honest vibe in himself; and since the sketchy squad outnumbers the dope ones and he’s always bumping into them, he ends up thinking (and gets labeled) as wise rather than a complete noob.

facts, he said.

so, the dope and wise judge we’re chasing isn’t this shady dude but the other one; ‘cause vice can’t really vibe with virtue too, and only that fire, time-schooled dude will net the deets on both virtue and vice – in my book, the legit man (not the sketchy one) holds the wisdom.

i’m on the same page.

this is the kinda drip, the kinda law, you’re gonna sanction in your state. it’s all about boosting the better vibes – healing the soul and the body; but those who are hella borked in the body get left to yeet themselves into oblivion, and the forever-rotten souls? they get auto-deleted.

no cap, that’s the ultimate flex for both the peeps and the state.

so our young homies, schooled only on that chill beat which inspires real moderation, are gonna be lowkey like “nah, law ain’t our vibe.”

obviously.

and the musician, who’s cruising on that same track, sticking with the basic gym flex instead of getting all fancy, ain’t gonna dabble in medicine unless things get super extreme.

i totally believe that.

the workouts and drills he’s hitting are meant to fire up his inner hype squad – not about getting jacked like some gym bro flexing his muscles; he ain’t out here using exercise to bulk up like the average athlete.

deadass, he said.

btw, these two arts – music and gym – aren’t just split like old-school stereotypes, one for training the soul and the other for buffing the body.

so, what’s the actual drip here?

i reckon, i said, that the teachers behind both are mainly about leveling up the soul.

how’s that even a thing? he asked.

didn’t you peep how going all-in on gym turns your mind into a beast mode that’s hard and ferocious, while vibing exclusively on tunes leaves you all soft and extra?

how so? he said.

i replied, gym vibes forge a spirit that’s tough and savage, whereas too much music leaves you soft and, honestly, a bit extra.

yep, he said, i totally get that a straight-up athlete can go full savage, and a full-time musician might melt and get more extra than is healthy.

but trust, i said, that ferocity is all about spirit – if you school it right, it gives you mad courage, but push it too hard and it turns into brutal, hard-edged force.

i’m totally on board with that.

on the flip side, a philosopher’s vibe is all chill and gentle; sure, get too much of it and you’re over-soft, but if you keep it balanced, you’re mellow and moderate.

word.

so, in our squad, the guardians gotta rock both that raw fire and that chill calm, right?

for sure.

and they’ve gotta be in perfect sync?

big facts.

so the harmonized soul is both chill and lit, right?

yeah.

and the off-key, inharmonious vibe? pure wack – cowardly and extra boorish.

deadass.

now, when a dude lets tunes blast through his ears – those sweet, soft, melancholic beats we just talked about – and he spends his whole life vibing in song, at first his inner fire gets tempered like legit iron, turning that raw passion into something useful instead of brittle clout.

but if he keeps that soft, soothing remix on repeat for too long, he starts melting down, wasting his vibe until his spirit’s nearly erased and his inner strength gets chopped – and bam, he turns into a feeble warrior.

facts.

if his inner hustle is already weak sauce, that meltdown drops super fast; but if he’s packing mad spirit, then too much music can make him extra trigger-happy – on the slightest tea he’s all fired up and then quickly fizzles out; instead of solid vibe, he turns irritable and overreacts, making him totally impractical.

preach.

so in gym life, if a dude goes beast-mode on his workouts and eats like a champ – basically, the antithesis of a soft music/philosophy buff – then at first his killer body fills him with pride and inner spirit, doubling his man-power.

facts.

but then, what’s the move? if he does nada else, never hollers with the muses, and his brain never gets that cultural upgrade or proper learning, his smarts will get all feeble, dull, and straight-up blind – his mind stays asleep and his senses never clear up.

facts, he said.

and he eventually ends up hating philosophy, turning uncivilized, never throwing down any savvy persuasion – he’s like a wild beast, all violent and fierce, with zero chill; living in complete ignorance and shady conditions, with no hint of class or grace.

that’s straight-up true, he said.

and since there are two core vibes in human nature – one is the spirited hype and the other the deep philosophical – some god, as i’d say, dropped two arts into our lives (linking only indirectly to the soul and body) so that these two parts, like the strings on an instrument, can be loosened or tightened until they’re perfectly harmonized.

word, that seems to be the plan.

and the one who mixes tunes with gym in the dopest balance, syncing them perfectly with the soul, can rightfully be called the ultimate musician and harmonist – way beyond just a basic string tuner.

you’re totally on point, socrates.

and a boss-level genius like that will always be needed in our state if our government is ever gonna last.

yep, he is a must, no cap.

so, those are our core principles of nurture and education: why even get into the nitty-gritty of our citizens’ dance moves, hunting, racing, gym battles, or equestrian showdowns? they all ride on that universal vibe, and once we nail that, breaking down the details is pure chill.

i bet, no cap, it’ll be a walk in the park.

sweet, i said; so what’s next? shouldn’t we ask who gets to call the shots and who’s just along for the ride?

lit, for sure.

no doubt, the older squad has gotta run the show over the younger.

facts.

and obviously, only the elite gets to be in charge.

no cap, that’s plain.

and aren’t the top farmers the ones who are all in on the farm life?

yep.

and since we need the dopest guardians for our city, they gotta have all the guardian vibes, right?

definitely.

and for that, they need to be smart and on point, always looking out for the state’s biz?

true.

and a dude’s most likely to care about what he loves?

to be sure.

and he’s gonna love what he thinks matches his own vibe, and what he figures is gonna impact his life the most – be that good or bad?

deadass, he replied.

so, we gotta do some serious filtering. let’s scope out among the guardians those who, their entire lives, are hella hyped to flex for their country and straight up cringe at any move against her interests.

those are the right men.

and they gotta be watched at every level, so we can peep if they stay true to their commitment and never, whether by force or some sus mind game, ghost on their duty to the state.

“how ghost on their duty?” he asked.

i’d break it down, i replied: a resolution can dip from a dude’s mind either by choice or without his say; by choice when he ditches a fake vibe for something real, or against his will when someone straight-up robs him of the truth.

i get it, he said – like, willingly dropping a mindset; but the involuntary loss? still in beta for me, bro.

so, i said, don’t you see that dudes get robbed of the good vibes against their will while they willingly chase the bad? losing the truth is straight-up wack, and having it is lit – you’d agree that seeing things as they truly are means you’re rolling with the truth, right?

yeah, he replied; i agree that people get their truth stolen, even if they don’t sign up for it.

and ain’t that involuntary truth loss all about theft, force, or some sketchy enchantment?

still, he replied, i ain’t fully vibing with what you’re saying.

i guess i was dropping tragic, deep feels like the old tragedians. all i mean is, some dudes get switched up by persuasion while others just straight up forget; arguments can snatch a class’s heart, and time does it for another – that’s what i call theft. you down with that?

yep.

and those who are forced? they’re the ones who flip their opinions ‘cause some heavy pain or grief slaps 'em into change.

got it, he said, and you’re dead on.

and you gotta admit that the enchanted are those who switch up their minds either ‘cause of chill pleasure vibes or hardcore fear?

yep, he said; anything that deceives can be called enchanting.

so then, as i was saying, we gotta scope out which guardians are truly loyal to the idea that the state’s best interest rules their lives. we gotta watch them from the jump, throw them into situations where they might get tricked or forget, and the one who keeps it 100 and isn’t fooled gets picked – and anyone who flops gets benched. that the move?

for sure.

and we should hit ‘em with some major challenges – toils, pains, and conflicts – so they can prove those same boss vibes even harder.

facts, he replied.

and then, i said, we gotta test them with enchantments – that’s like our third boss level – and peep their reaction: just like testing colts in a ruckus to see if they’re timid, we gotta toss our youth into epic terrors and then slide them into pleasures, testing ‘em harder than gold gets melted in a furnace, to see if they’re built against all mind games, and always keep that regal, rhythmic, harmonious vibe – the kind that’s hella useful for both the individual and the state.

and whoever, at every stage – as a kid, youth, and mature adult – comes out of these trials victorious and pure, gets crowned as a ruler and guardian of the state; they’ll be honored in life and in death, receiving the highest tributes we can drop. but anyone who fails? they get rejected, no doubt. i’m leaning that this is the blueprint for picking our rulers and guardians. i speak in general terms, no cap on exactness.

and, overall, i agree with you, he said.

and maybe the title “guardian” in the full-on sense should only go to that upper-tier squad who keeps us safe from foreign haters and holds down peace at home – so no one’s gonna have the will or power to mess with us. the young dudes we used to call guardians? they’re more like our backup, the sidekicks supporting the rulers’ principles.

i agree, he said.

so, how do we cook up one of those essential fakes we mentioned – just one royal lie that might even fool the rulers (if that’s even possible) and, at the very least, the rest of the city?

“what kinda lie?” he asked.

nothing fresh, i replied; just an old phoenician tale (from the laws) about stuff that’s popped off before in other places – like the poets say and had the world buy into – though not in our current scene, and i ain’t even sure if something like that could ever drop again or be made likely now.

yo, your words sound hella hesitant!

don’t trip on my pause, i replied – wait ‘til you hear the rest.

“spill it,” he said, “and don’t be scared.”

alright then, i’ll drop it, even though i ain’t really sure how to look you in the eye or what drip to use for this audacious fiction i’m about to drop gradually – first to the rulers, then the soldiers, and finally to the people. they’re gonna be told that their youth was just a dream, and all that education and training they got from us was basically a front; in reality, during all that time they were being prepped and fed in the earth’s own womb, where they and their gear were crafted from scratch; when they were done, the earth, their mama, sent them up; so since their country is both their mama and their nurse, they’re bound to always have her back, defend her from haters, and treat her citizens like earth’s own kiddos and their own bros.

you had legit reason, he said, to be lowkey ashamed of that lie you were about to drop.

true, i replied, but there’s more tea – i’ve only spilled half. in our tale, we’ll tell the citizens: you’re all bros, but god made you different. some of you flex with command power ‘cause he mixed a little gold into you – that’s why you get the highest honors; others got silver, meant to be the wingmen; and some, destined to be farmers and craftsmen, got cast as brass and iron – and this mix goes down in the kids too. but since everyone’s from the same OG squad, sometimes a golden parent drops a silver kid, or a silver parent pops out a golden one. and god’s like, first rule to the rulers is to guard that pure lineage above everything – nothing is more crucial to watch than the mix in your offspring. ‘cause if a golden or silver kid gets too much brass and iron mixed in, nature flips the script, and the ruler’s gotta be cool about the kid dropping a rank to become a farmer or artisan – just like artisan kids with a dash of gold or silver get bumped up to guardian or wingman status. plus, an oracle’s out here saying that if a brass or iron dude ends up guarding the state, it’s game over. that’s the story; think our citizens can buy into it?

not with the current generation, he replied; it just ain’t gonna fly – but their sons, then their grandsons, and all the posterity after could be made to vibe with this tale.

i feel you on the struggle, i replied; still, if we can get this belief rolling, it’ll make them care harder for the city and for each other. but enough about the fiction, which is about to go viral on rumor wings, while we gear up our earthborn heroes and lead them out under their rulers’ command. let them scope out a prime spot where they can squash any insurrection from within and fend off enemies who, like wolves, might roll in from outside; there, let them set up camp, and once they’ve dropped their tents, let them throw sacrifices to the proper gods and get their cribs ready.

exactly, he said.

and their cribs gotta be built to block off the winter chills and the summer scorch.

i guess you’re talking houses, he replied.

yeah, i said; but these have gotta be soldier cribs, not some shopkeeper’s joint.

“what’s the diff?” he asked.

i’ll break it down, i replied. keeping watchdogs around who, ‘cause they’re lacking discipline, starving, or stuck in some bad habits, turn on the flock and cause chaos – acting less like obedient dogs and more like wild wolves – would be super vile for a shepherd.

that’s straight-up monstrous, he said.

so, we’ve gotta make sure our backup squad, even though they’re stronger than our regular peeps, don’t end up growing too big for them and turning into savage tyrants instead of being friends and allies.

yep, mad precautions needed.

and wouldn’t a dope, real-deal education be the ultimate safeguard?

but they’re already hella educated, he replied.

i can’t be so sure, my dear glaucon, i said; i’m way more convinced that they should be, and that true education – whatever that really means – is the sickest way to civilize and humanize them in how they vibe with each other and those under their protection.

facts, he replied.

and not just their schooling, but their cribs and everything about their setup should be designed so as not to mess with their guardian virtue or tempt them to flex on other citizens. any smart dude knows that.

no doubt.

so, let’s peep what their lifestyle’s gonna be if they fully embody our idea. first off, none of them should own extra property – only the bare essentials; no private cribs or secret stashes locked off from others; their gear should only be what’s necessary for trained warriors – dudes known for keeping it cool and courageous; they gotta agree to take a fixed paycheck from the citizens, just enough to cover the yearly expenses and nothing extra; and they’ll be rolling together, living like soldiers in a camp.

we’ll tell ‘em that gold and silver are like gifts from god – that the divine metal already flows within them, so they don’t need the extra dross that circulates among regular folks; they shouldn’t pollute their divine essence with that common trash metal, ‘cause that basic metal has sparked a ton of shady moves, while their own vibe stays pure. in fact, they alone, out of all the citizens, aren’t allowed to touch, share a roof with, wear, or even sip from gold or silver. and that, fam, is their salvation – making them the ultimate state saviors.

but if they ever start stacking up their own houses, lands, or cash, they flip the script from guardians to domestics – becoming housekeepers or farmers instead of true guardians, turning into enemies and tyrants rather than being solid allies; they’ll be hating and being hated, scheming and getting schemed against, and spend their whole lives more terrified of internal beef than external threats, and then the ruin – for both them and the whole state – will drop hard.

so, considering all that, can we say our state should be set up like this, with these rules we drop for guardians about their cribs and all their affairs?

yep, said glaucon.

book iv.

here adeimantus piped up with a question: “how would you reply, socrates, if someone came up and said you’re making these peeps miserable, and that they’re the ones causing their own bad vibes; like, the city is totally theirs but they ain’t any better off for it; while other dudes are out here stacking lands, building huge, flashy cribs, and flexing on everyone with top-tier sacrifices to the gods and next-level hospitality; plus, as you mentioned, they got gold and silver and all that primo fortune swag; but our poor citizens? they’re basically just mercenaries parked in the city, always on guard duty?”

yeah, i was like, and you can lowkey add that these peeps just get fed – no extra coin dropped on them like the other dudes; so they literally can’t, even if they wanted, go on a chill vacay for fun – they got zero cash to flex on a bae or any boujee treat that the world calls “happiness”; and, fr, there’s a whole extra load of shade we could throw in the same lane.

but, he was like, let’s assume all that tea is already in the charge.

you tryna ask, i said, what’s our clapback?

yeah.

if we stick to the OG trail, i was like, we’re gonna scoop up the answer. and our answer? even as is, our guardians could literally be the happiest squad ever; but our whole mission in building the state was never to over-hype one class’s feelz, but to max out the overall good vibes for everyone. we figured that in a state set up for squad goals, justice would be the norm, and in a state that’s all over the place, you get injustice; and once we peep both, we can decide which vibe is actually happier. right now, i’m thinking we’re crafting this happy state as one big, unified flex – not just patching up a few happy peeps – and later on, we’ll scope out the totally flipped vibe of an unchill state.

imagine we’re spray-painting a statue and some random comes up like, “yo, why you not droppin’ the dopest colors on the sickest parts of the body? the eyes should be lit up in purple, but you left ‘em all black!” and we’d be like, “sir, you wouldn’t have us overdo the eyes ‘til they ain’t even eyes anymore, bro; think about if balancing all the features on fleek makes the whole piece fire.” 

so i’m like, don’t force us to slap on a kind of happiness on our guardians that would flip them into anything but, well, guardians; ‘cause we can totally deck our farmhands in royal drip, crown ‘em with gold, and let them hustle till they drop – and that’s it. our potters? they can chill on couches, kick it by the fire, passing around the wine like it’s trending, with their wheel always on standby, grinding on pottery as hard or as chill as they feel. this way, every squad gets their vibe, and then, as you’d expect, the whole state goes full happy mode.

but yo, don’t let that idea seep into us; ‘cause if we vibe with that, our farmhands won’t be real farmhands, the potters will stop being potters, and no one will rock a distinct class rep in the state. sure, that’s not a big mood when only the sneaky, fake-on-the-inside cobblers are messin’ with it; but when the true law-keepers and government homies turn out to be phony guardians, then watch how they flip the whole state upside down – even though they’re the only ones who can really serve up order and good vibes.

we meant our guardians to be legit saviors, not the state’s ultimate clout destroyers, while our hater is picturing festival peasants just living it up instead of citizens grindin’ for the state. if that’s what he’s on about, then we’re talkin’ different things – he’s hyping something that ain’t even a real state. so we gotta peep whether in picking our guardians we focus on their individual glow-up or if the real happy energy lives in the state as a total squad. and if it’s the latter, then our guardians, aides, and every squad member need to be hyped or even forced to crush their own roles flawlessly. that way, the entire state vibes up in a noble, orderly flex, with every class getting the perfect share of happiness that nature’s all about.

i’m totally with you on that.

i wonder, though, if you’re cool with another spicy take that just hit my mind.

what’s that vibe?

apparently, there are two main reasons the arts get all sus and start to decline.

and what are they?

it’s all about wealth, i said, and straight-up poverty.

so how do they roll?

here’s the tea: when a potter gets loaded, do you think he’ll still be sweating the small deets on his art?

nah, fr.

he’s just gonna get more and more lazy and slack, right?

preach.

and that means he turns into a majorly wack potter?

yes, he totally levels down.

but then, flip side, if he’s broke and can’t even cop the proper tools, he won’t be able to grind properly himself, nor will he school his sons or apprentices on how to slay the craft.

definitely not.

so whether you’re swimming in cash or stuck in poverty, both the dude and his work are doomed to get worse, no cap.

facts.

so here we uncover some fresh toxic vibes that our guardians gotta watch out for, ‘cause if not, these evils might just roll into our city on the down-low.

which evils, you ask?

wealth, i said, and poverty; one spawns baller luxury and mad laziness, and the other breeds stinginess and pure nastiness – and both churn out mad discontent.

that’s hella true, he replied; but still, socrates, how’s our city gonna flex in a war, especially against a rich, powerhouse enemy, if we’re missing the muscle for war?

there’d definitely be a struggle, i replied, going up against one such beast; but honestly, it’s not a problem if you’ve got two.

how’s that work? he asked.

first off, i said, if we gotta throw down, our squad is loaded with trained warriors taking on an army of rich bros.

true that, he said.

and don’t you reckon, adeimantus, that a one-man boxing legend who’s on point would totally take on two chunky, well-off dudes who aren’t even boxers?

nah, if they ambush him all at once.

but then, i said, what if that legend can dip, then spin back and hit the first dude? and if he keeps doing that a few times under a blazing sun, wouldn’t he, as an absolute pro, take down more than one chonky guy?

sure, he said – nothing surprising there.

yet, real talk, rich dudes probably flex more in the art of boxing than they do with military hustle.

likely.

so we might assume our athletes could wreck two or even three times their own squad size?

i’m with you; that totally makes sense.

and picture this: before any throwdown, our citizens send an envoy to one of the two cities saying, “here’s the real tea: we don’t have silver or gold nor are we allowed to, but you can – so slide through, help us in war, and scoop up the spoils from the other city.” now, who in their right mind would wanna square up against scrappy, lean mutts rather than, with the dogs on their side, going up against some chubby, tender sheep?

that’s not likely; but still, there might be mad risk for a poor state if the riches of a bunch of states get piled into one.

but damn, it’s wild how you drop the term “state” for any squad that isn’t even ours!

why’s that?

you gotta call other states by their proper plural, fam; none of them are just one city, but a whole mix of cities, like they always say in the game. like, any city, however tiny, is basically split into two – one side for the poor and one for the rich – and they’re constantly beefing; plus, within each, there are heaps of mini-squads, so you’d be way off if you lumped them all as one state. but if you handle them as a spread, sharing wealth, power, or even people from one to another, you always end up with mad allies, not a truckload of enemies. and your state, while keeping that wise order we just laid out, will be the dopest of states – not just in clout or looks, but in real action and truth, even if she’s only got like a thousand hardcore defenders. finding a state equal to hers? good luck, whether among hellenes or barbarians – even if some look huge on paper, they don’t really stack up.

that’s straight facts, he said.

and then i asked, what’s the ultimate cap for our rulers when sizing up the state – like, how big can it get before they draw the line?

what limit you suggest?

i’d say let the state grow only as far as keeping the squad united – that’s the real move.

mad props, he said.

so then, here’s another boss command for our guardians: let our city be seen as neither extra large nor tiny, but as one solid, self-sufficient unit.

and for real, he said, that ain’t a harsh command at all.

and then, i added, the other vibe we dropped earlier is even lighter – i mean, the duty to downgrade the offspring of guardians when they’re low-key trash, and to level up the lower-class kids into guardian status when they got that natural drip. the plan was that for the citizens in general, everyone should be put to work doing exactly what nature intended for them – one-to-one, so every dude handles his own hustle, keeping it one and not many; and then the whole city vibes as one solid entity, not a scattered crew.

yeah, he said; that’s not a crazy ask.

the rules we’re laying down, my good adeimantus, ain’t a load of grand, complicated doctrines – they’re just little tweaks, as long as you keep your eye on the one major vibe – a vibe i’d rather call not massive, but totally sufficient for our game plan.

and what’s that, you ask?

education and total glow-up nurture, i said: if our citizens get a sick education and level up into sensible peeps, they’ll easily navigate all this tea – plus other stuff i’m not even dropping here, like marriage, locking down a bae, and reppin’ the fam by procreating – all sticking to that universal rule that friends share all the deets, like the old proverb goes.

that’s the ultimate move, for sure.

also, i said, when a state kicks off right, it builds unstoppable momentum like a rolling wheel. good nourishment and education lay down a dope foundation, and as that foundation sinks in, it only levels up more – and that upgrade spreads through the human squad just like it does in other creatures.

you got that, he said.

so here’s the 411: our rulers need to be all about keeping music and gymnastic vibes in their OG form – no remixing allowed. they gotta hustle to keep ’em intact. and whenever someone starts chirping about “the newest jam the singers dropped,” they’d be trippin’, ‘cause that might be hyping a new kind of song; and that’s not something to get hype about or call the poet’s ultimate drop. any new musical remix is hella dangerous for the entire state, and should be banned. so damon told me, and tbh, i’m down with him – he says that when music modes switch up, the core laws of the state always flip too.

yeah, said adeimantus; and you can add my vote to damon’s and yours.

so then, i asked, should our guardians lay down the foundation of their fortress on a vibe of music?

yeah, he said; ‘cause the chaos you mentioned creeps in on that front way too smooth.

exactly, i replied – starting off as harmless fun, but then it trickles in.

true, he said, and there ain’t any harm at first; but bit by bit, that wild spirit gets cozy, sneaks into our everyday manners and customs; then it starts wrecking contracts between peeps, and soon it’s crashing laws and constitutions, ending up, socrates, with a total overthrow of all rights – personal and public.

for real? i asked.

that’s my vibe, he replied.

so then, as i was saying, our youth need to be trained from day one in a super strict system – ‘cause if fun turns into total lawless madness, the youngsters can never grow into chill, virtuous citizens.

deadass true, he said.

and when they kick off with some solid playtime, and with music helping them get that order habit, that order becomes their jam in everything they do – a total glow-up that lifts them up, and if there are any sketchy zones in the state, it raises them right back up.

mad true, he said.

if they get educated like that, they’ll even come up with their own minor rules to fill in the gaps that the old squad totally ghosted.

what you mean?

i mean stuff like this: – when the young should stay silent for their elders; how to show respect by standing up and letting them sit; what honor is due to your parents; what fits you should rock – clothes or kicks; how to style your hair; proper vibes and manners overall. you feel me?

yeah.

but like, i think there’s little wisdom in micromanaging those deets by law – i doubt anyone’s ever really locked down those specifics; and any tight written rules on that are never gonna stick.

impossible.

it seems, adeimantus, that the direction education sets a dude on totally maps out his future vibe. like attracts like, right?

definitely.

until some rare, epic result pops off that might flip the script?

no cap, true.

so for that reason, i’m not gonna get all up in legislating more on those minor things.

naturally, he replied.

alright, and what about the whole hustle of the agora – the everyday dealings between peeps, or agreements with artisans; like, when peeps get dissed or injured, how lawsuits kick off, or how juries are picked – what’s your take? there could also be questions on market or harbor fees, and the overall house rules for markets, police, docks, and all that jazz. but yo, are we really gonna stoop to micromanaging all these tiny deets?

i think, he said, that good peeps don’t need strict laws for these vibes; they’ll naturally figure out the right rules soon enough.

yeah, i said, my dude, if god only keeps slapping down the laws we set for them.

and without divine backup, said adeimantus, they’ll keep forever tweaking their laws and hustling for perfection.

you’d compare them, i said, to those wannabe invalids who never quit their bad habits of overindulgence?

exactly.

yeah, i replied; and what a wild life they lead! they’re always overhauling, complicating, and beefing up their messy lives, totally convinced some magic fix or miracle cure will sort them out if they just try another gimmick.

these kinds of cases are super common, he said, with those types.

for real, i replied; and the crazy part is, they end up hating the dude who tells them the truth – that unless they ditch the whole eating, drinking, wenching, and chilling routine, no drug, spell, amulet, or whatever remedy is gonna cut it.

charming, he replied. i mean, i see zero charm in getting all heated with someone who’s just calling it like it is.

and these guys, i said, clearly ain’t in your good books.

assuredly not.

nor would you give props to states acting like the clout-chasing dudes i just roasted? ‘cause aren’t there totally wack states where citizens get straight-up banned – under penalty of death – from switching up the constitution; yet the dude who sweet-talks and spoils those living under that vibe, predicting and catering to their moods, is hailed as a dope statesman? don’t those states legit mirror the types i was just dissing?

yeah, he said; those states are as trash as the peeps running them, and i’m not here to give them any props.

but don’t you vibe with the smooth, slick moves of those quick-change ministers of political corruption?

yeah, he said, i do – but not all of them, ‘cause some get so hyped by the crowd they straight-up believe they’re real statesmen, and those ain’t really worth the clout.

what you mean? i said; you should feel more for them. when a dude can’t measure up, and a bunch of others who can’t measure also claim he’s like four cubits tall, can he even help but buy into that hype?

nah, he said, definitely not.

well, then, don’t even trip on them; ‘cause they’re as entertaining as a play, fumbling through weak reforms like the ones i was just dishing on – they’re always thinking that strict laws will end frauds in contracts and all the other shady biz i mentioned, not knowing they’re basically chopping off heads on a hydra.

yeah, he said; that’s exactly what they’re doing.

i figure that a true legislator isn’t gonna waste time with this mess of petty laws, whether in a chaotic state or one that’s on point; ‘cause in a messy state they’re useless, and in a tight state they’ll just flow naturally out of the main vibe we already set.

so what’s left for us when it comes to legislation?

nothing for us, i replied; but for apollo – the god of delphi – there’s still the major work of ordering the biggest, noblest, most epic stuff of all.

and what’s that? he asked.

the setup of temples and sacrifices, the full-on service of gods, demigods, and heroes; plus, sorting out the resting spots for the dead and the rituals for pleasing the homies in the underworld. these are things we don’t even have the lowkey 411 on ourselves, so as founders of a city, we’d be super sus trusting them to anyone but our OG deity. he’s the one who chills in the center, at the earth’s navel, and he’s the ultimate interpreter of all things religious for humankind.

you’re right, and we’ll roll with that plan.

but yo, amid all this, where’s justice? ariston’s son, drop the deets. now that our city’s been leveled up into a livable flex, light a candle and peep around – bring your bro, polemarchus, and the rest of the crew – and let’s hunt down where justice is hiding and where the shade of injustice lurks, how they differ, and which vibe a truly happy person should be rocking, whether the gods and peeps see it or not.

nonsense, said glaucon: didn’t you promise to get on the case yourself, saying that not helping justice when she’s in need would be straight-up impious?

i ain’t denying i said that, and now that you reminded me, i’m gonna stick to my word – but you gotta squad up too.

we will, he replied.

alright then, here’s my plan to crack this case: i’m gonna start with the idea that our state, if it’s set up right, is totally perfect.

no doubt about it.

and being perfect, it’s automatically wise, brave, chill, and just.

that’s crystal.

and whichever of these fly virtues we spot in the state, the one that’s missing is basically the leftover piece?

exactly.

if there were four things and we were on the hunt for one, wherever it might be, we’d know it right off, and there’d be no extra drama; or we could spot the other three first, and then the missing one is clearly the one that’s left.

spot on, he said.

and shouldn’t we use a similar plan for the virtues, which are, like, four in number too?

for sure.

first up among the state’s vibes is wisdom – and in that, i peep a quirky twist.

what’s the twist?

the state we described is said to be wise ‘cause it’s solid in dishing out good advice, right?

deadass true.

and good advice is basically a type of knowledge – ‘cause peeps don’t drop quality counsel out of ignorance, they do it with know-how.

obviously.

and there’s hella types of knowledge in a state?

of course.

you got the carpenter’s know-how; but is that the kind of knowledge that makes a city be called “wise” and killer at advice?

exactly.

def not; that would only give the city a rep for being lit at woodwork, no cap.  

so, a city ain't automatically clouted as wise just 'cause it knows all the hacks on wooden gear?  

def not.  

and like, not 'cause it's got the lowkey scoop on bronze pots or any other similar flex, i was like?  

nah, he replied, not for any of that tea.  

and not just for being woke about farming either; that'd only tag the city as a straight-up farmstead, right?  

yup.  

so i was like, but is there any sick knowledge in our freshly minted state that drops wisdom not just on one part, but on the whole vibe—like how to manage itself and squad with other states?  

for sure there is.  

and what’s this knowledge, and who’s flexing it? i asked.  

it's that guardian drip, he replied, and it's found among the absolute bosses we just vibe-called the perfect guardians.  

so what do we call the city when it's packing that next-level wisdom flex?  

it's named for its boss-level counsel game and its genuine wise vibes.  

and in our state, will we ball with more of these top-tier guardians, or will the grind be mostly smiths?  

he was like, nah fam—the smiths will be on deck in way higher numbers.  

so like, the guardians won't be the tiniest crew among the squads known for a dope knowledge flex, right?  

on point, they’re the micro squad.  

so basically, even though they’re the littlest clique, this crew’s boss-level brain game rules the state, and that’s the only knowledge actually lit enough to be called wisdom—by nature’s decree, always the smallest squad in the lineup.  

facts, straight up.  

i was like, so that nails down one of the four key virtues in the state, fr fr.  

he hit back, like, "totally, and in my humble opinion, that's bomb discovered."  

then i was like, also, we can spot that dope vibe called courage, and zero cap on which part is rocking that valiant energy that makes a state hella brave.  

like, what exactly u mean?  

i was like, everyone who's dissing or hyping a state on bravery is eyeballing the squad that goes out there in the trenches fighting for the state.  

he clapped back, "for real, no one else even gets it."  

like, the other peeps might be brave or jinxed, but their vibes ain't gonna flip the state's rep to either brave af or total wimps, i reckon.  

def not.  

the state's brave vibe comes from that clique which, no matter the tea—be it pleasure or pain, desire or fear—keeps the legit, pre-trained views on what’s scary and what isn’t, just as the law schooled them; and that's what we call courage.  

i need you to spill those deets again, cuz i ain't totally catching your drift.  

i mean, courage is like a total save—a legit soul rescue.  

save what though?  

it's the save for keeping it 100 on what’s worth fearing and what isn’t—the opinion the law dropped in our education—and when i say "under all circumstances," i mean that whether you're riding high on pleasure or feeling the pain, chasing clout or ghosted by fear, you gotta stick to that lit perspective. wanna peep an example?  

bet, spill it.  

so, you know how dyers, when they're about to flex that true sea-purple on wool, first hunt down the pure white? they prep that base with mad care so it can fully rock the purple hue. then the dye game goes on, and whatever gets dipped this way stays forever fire—no matter how many washes with crazy chemicals hit it. but if the base isn't prepped right, you'll notice the purple (or any other color) ends up looking totally washed-out and sus.  

he was like, "facts, i know it ends up all washed-out and kinda cringe."  

then i was like, so now you get why we picked our soldiers and schooled them in beats and body moves; we were out here brewing up vibes to help them absorb the laws' dye like pure perfection, locking in their stance on danger and every other deets so no wild pleasure (which can wash out the soul harder than any chemical) or deep sorrow, fear, and desire—the ultimate soul solvents—can ever fade their drip. this universal power to keep true opinions on real and fake dangers aligned with the law? that's what i call courage, unless you lowkey disagree.  

but he was like, "i vibe with you—you're excluding that clueless, raw courage of a wild beast or a slave; that ain't the kind of courage the law wants, and it should def get a different name."  

definitely.  

so can i read it as: courage is exactly what you just described?  

i was like, "yeah, for real—and if you add 'of a citizen,' that's basically on point; anyway, later we can deep dive further, but right now we ain't hunting for more courage, we're locking in on justice; we've dropped enough tea on courage for now."  

he shot back, "facts, you're right."  

so, two more vibes gotta be uncovered in the state—first, temperance, and then justice, which is the ultimate finish-line we're chasing.  

big facts.  

but yo, can we spot justice without even peeping temperance?  

he was like, "idk how that would even work, and i ain't about seeing justice shine if temperance gets ghosted; so do me a solid and let's scope temperance first."  

i was like, "bet, i would never ghost your request."  

then he said, "dude, think on it."  

i replied, "aight, i'll do it; and from what i see, temperance is basically like that vibe of perfect harmony—a full-on symphony—compared to the earlier virtue."  

he was like, "how so?"  

i replied, "temperance is all about flexing control over your pleasures and cravings; it’s totally what they mean when they drop 'a man being his own master,' and you see that notion echoed all over our chats."  

he was like, "no doubt, fam."  

i mean, the whole 'master of himself' vibe is kinda sus, bc like, the boss can also be the sidekick and vice versa; essentially, it's all the same person in different roles.  

facts.  

basically, i believe it means that in our soul, there's a dope part and a not-so-dope part; and if the dope part runs the show and keeps the lame part in check, you're your own boss—major props. but if shady influences let the lame part take over, then you're labeled a total self-slave and lowkey unprincipled.  

facts, that totally makes sense.  

i was like, "peep our brand new state—and you'll see that vibe in action; the state should be seen as its own boss if 'temperance' and 'self-mastery' mean that the dope side is running the show."  

he replied, "facts, i see that, word."  

plus, note that all those layered pleasures, wild desires, and deep pains tend to be packed in kiddos, women, servants, and the so-called freemen—the lowest, most numerous crew.  

he was like, "def, no cap."  

whereas those chill, balanced cravings that roll with reason and are guided by real smarts, are only rocked by a few—the crème de la crème who are born and schooled right.  

big facts, for real.  

so, as you can peep, these two vibes have their spot in our state; while the basic, lowkey cravings of the masses get kept in check by the boss-level vibes of the elite few.  

he was like, "i vibe, gotcha."  

so if there's any city that can be called the ultimate boss of its own pleasures and vibes, do you think ours can flex that title?  

he replied, "definitely, fam."  

it could also be dubbed temperate, for the same lit reasons?  

yeah, no doubt.  

and if there's any state where the bosses and the squad agree on who should rule, then that's our vibe too, right?  

undoubtedly.  

and if all the peeps are vibing on that, then which crew gets to rock the temperance drip—the rulers or the homies?  

he replied, "i’d say it's in both squads, straight up."  

do you peep that our guess about temperance being like a dope harmony was spot on?  

"why's that, though?"  

"because, duh, unlike courage and wisdom—which are locked to specific crews (one making the state smart, the other making it bold)—temperance vibes across the whole squad. it runs through every note of the scale, creating a chill harmony between the weak, the strong, and the in-betweens, whether they're droppin' fire wisdom, beast mode strength, stacked numbers, or heavy clout. so basically, temperance is the truce between the naturally extra and the not-so-extra, about who gets to call the shots—both in states and in individuals."  

i’m straight up with you on that.  

so, i said, we can clock three outta the four major virtues in our state. the last essential vibe that makes a state virtuous has gotta be justice—if only we knew what that was exactly.  

obviously, fam.  

so now, glaucon, it's time we go full hunter mode, circle the area, and keep our eyes peeled so justice doesn't yeet away into the shadows; for real, she’s somewhere in this land. so stay woke and let me know if you spot her first, aight?  

would love to, but you gotta know i'm more a ride-or-die follower with just enough eyeballs to catch your drip—that's pretty much my clout.  

drop a prayer with me and then tag along.  

i got you, but you gotta lead the way, fam.  

i was like, "there's no lit path here—the wood's dark and hella perplexing—but we gotta slide forward regardless."  

let's yeet forward.  

yo, check it—I spotted something: "hallo!" i was like, "i see a trail, and i bet the quarry ain't about to ghost us."  

he was like, "good vibes, bet!"  

i was like, "real talk, we’re such stupid clowns, man."  

"why tho?"  

"bro, at the start of our quest ages ago, justice was straight-up tumbling at our feet and we totally missed her—like, nothing could be more ridiculous. it was like peeps looking for the stuff already in their hands; we were checking out some far-off hype and ended up missing what was right under us."  

"what's your drift?"  

"i mean, for real, we've been yapping about justice for ages without even recognizing that she was vibing with us."  

"man, i'm lowkey exhausted by your long-winded intro."  

so i said, "tell me if i'm off: remember the OG rule we laid down when building this state—that each person should stick to the one thing that suits their natural vibe? now, justice is basically that principle or at least a slice of it."  

he was like, "yeah, we always said a dude should just do his own thing."  

and we also confirmed that justice means minding your own biz and not being a nosy parker; we dropped that truth bomb over and over, and loads of peeps hit us with the same vibe.  

facts, that's what we said.  

so if you're just doing your own thing the right way, that's like justice. can you tell me how i pulled that inference?  

i ain't sure, but i'd love a deets drop.  

'cause i reckon this is the only vibe that remains in the state once you peel away temperance, courage, and wisdom; it's like the ultimate catalyst that holds them all together—a preservative that keeps every other virtue in check. and like we said, if we discovered three, then justice is the fourth, the final piece.  

that follows, no cap.  

if we're asked which of these four qualities boosts the state's excellence the most—whether it's the unity between rulers and subjects, the soldiers holding tight to the law's take on what’s truly dangerous, the wise and watchful rulers, or even that quality seen in kiddos, women, slaves, freemen, artisans, rulers, and subjects—basically, everyone just doing their own grind instead of being a meddling busybody, then that vibe would snatch the crown; it's not an easy call.  

he replied, "def, it's kinda tough to pinpoint which one."  

so like, each individual’s power to stick to their own hustle is in a showdown with the other political vibes—wisdom, temperance, and courage.  

he said, "yeah, true."  

and the vibe that’s in this collab is justice?  

exactly, no cap.  

let's flip the script: aren't the rulers the ones you'd trust to drop verdicts when sorting out legal beefs?  

definitely.  

and legal cases are all about making sure no dude snatches someone else's stash or gets jacked of his own, right?  

yep, that's the whole deal.  

so that's a just principle?  

yes.  

so looking at it this way, justice is basically about having and doing what's rightfully yours, no cap?  

fact, very true.  

now check this: say a carpenter goes off doing a cobbler's hustle, or a cobbler flips into carpentry; or they swap tools or roles, or one dude ends up doubling up—do you think that mix-up would cause major drama for the state?  

nah, not really.  

but when a cobbler—or any dude naturally built to be a trader, hyped up on cash, clout, or squad size—tries to crash the warrior crew, or a warrior slides into the legislator/guardian gig they're totally not built for, swapping tools or duties, or when one dude ends up as trader, lawmaker, and warrior all in one chaotic mashup, then yo, you'll definitely agree that this role-swap and meddling spells the ruin for the state.  

most true, straight up.  

so i was like, "seeing as we've got three clear squads, any messing around—one crashing into another, or switching roles—is the biggest glitch to the state; it’s pure evil-doing."  

"precisely, fam."  

and the worst burn to your own city, you'd call that straight-up injustice, right?  

definitely.  

so that's injustice; but on the flip side, when the trader, the auxiliary, and the guardian all stick to their own gigs, that's pure justice—and that’s what makes the city just.  

i vibe with that.  

i said, "we're not gonna jump to conclusions yet; but if, on testing, this concept of justice checks out in both individuals and the state, then there won't be any room for doubt. if it doesn’t, we gotta reboot our investigation. remember, we started by examining justice on a macro scale (the state) thinking it’d be easier to spot than in a single person. we built our state as tight as possible, knowing that a good state would flex justice. now, let’s apply that discovery to the individual—if they vibe, we're golden; if not, we'll circle back to the state and re-test the theory. maybe the friction between the two will spark a light where justice shines bright, and that vision will be locked in our souls."  

that's totally in the works; let's roll with your plan, fam.  

then i asked, "when two things—a big one and a small one—are called the same, are they seriously alike or not?"  

he replied, "like, yes, they're basically similar."  

so a just person, if we just think about the idea of justice, is he basically like the just state?  

he will, for sure.  

and we figured a state is just when each of the three squads handles their own grind; plus, it's seen as temperate, valiant, and wise because of the extra vibes those same squads bring.  

he said, "true, no cap."  

so for an individual, we can assume they've got the same three core vibes in their own soul as the state; and they can be described in the same way, since they're on the same wavelength, right?  

definitely, he said.  

again, my dude, we've landed on an easy question—does the soul even have these three core principles or nah?  

an easy question? nah fam, as Socrates would say, "hard is the good."  

big facts, i said; and i don't think our current method is enough to fully break down this question—the real method has to be a different, longer grind. still, we can hit a solution that's at least as solid as our last deep dive.  

he said, "can't we just roll with that? under these vibes, i'm totally chill with that."  

"same here, i’m hella satisfied with that, bro."  

then he said, "don’t dip out on this deep convo; keep grinding on the speculation."  

i said, "aren't we all made of the same vibes and habits that fuel the state? like, how else do they even get there? think about passion or spirit—it’d be wild to imagine that when you spot that fire quality in states, it doesn’t come from the individuals, like the Thracians, the Scythians, and generally the whole northern squad. same goes for the love of knowledge—which is our region’s signature vibe—or even the love of cash, seen just as much among the Phoenicians and Egyptians."  

"exactly so," he replied.  

this is totally obvious, no cap.  

none whatsoever.  

but here’s the kicker—it gets messy when we ask if these principles are really three separate vibes or just one. like, do we learn with one part of our nature, get heated with another, and have a third part chase our natural cravings; or is the whole soul in play every single time? that’s the real struggle.  

he said, "yes, there lies the difficulty."  

so let's now try to figure out if they're one and the same vibe or totally different.  

he asked, "how do we even do that?"  

i replied, "look, the same thing can't be doing double duty—like, acting and being acted on in totally opposite ways in the same spot and time. so whenever you spot that contradiction in something that’s supposedly the same, it's a dead giveaway they're really different."  

"good, bet."  

for example, i said, "can one thing be chillin' and moving all at once, in the exact same part?"  

"impossible, no cap."  

still, i said, "let's get our terms straight so we don't end up in a beef later. picture a dude who's standing but also waving his hands and bobbing his head; and if someone claims he's both in motion and totally still at the same moment, we'd call that out and say, 'nah, one part's on the move while another's parked.'"  

very true.

so check it: if the objector decides to flex even harder and drop the sick diff that not only parts of tops but whole tops—when they spin with their pegs locked in place—are both totally chillin’ and on the move at the same time (and he might legit say the same about anything that spins in that same spot), then nah fam, we ain’t buying that objection. in that sitch, stuff ain’t vibin’ as both at rest and on the move in the same spots; we’d rather say they rock both an axis and a rim, where the axis is straight-up parked (no deviation, perp on fleek) and the rim is busy going round and round. but yo, if during that whirl the axis starts leanin’ right or left, forward or backward, then there’s literally no angle where they can be considered chill.

“that’s how you do it right,” he clapped back.

so none of these extra drama objections will have us shook into thinking that the same thing—at the same moment, in the same spot, or in relation to the same vibe—can both act and be acted on in totally opposite ways.

“def not, in my honest opinion, no cap.”

yet, i said, so we don’t gotta break our brains over every lame counter-argument and prove they’re bogus. let’s just assume they’re straight-up absurd and roll with it, knowing that if this assumption later gets canceled, we can yeet all the follow-up consequences.

“bet, that’s the move,” he said.

alright fam, don’t you think that assent and dissent, desire and aversion, attraction and repulsion—all these are just opposites, whether they’re actively flexin’ or chillin’ passively? 

“yeet, they’re straight-up opposites,” he confirmed.

and also, hunger and thirst, and all those crave vibes in general, plus the whole deal of willing and wishing—they’d all fall into those same squads we just mentioned. you’d basically say, right? that a soul that’s caught up in desire is low-key huntin’ for the object of its craving; or that it’s pullin’ in that dope thing it wants to possess; or even, when someone’s tryna get something handed to ‘em, their mind throws a nod like “yeah, sign me up,” as if answering a question.

“deadass.”

and what about the anti vibes—unwillingness, dislike, the total absence of desire? shouldn’t these fall under the squad of repulsion and rejection?

“for sure.”

so assuming we’re cool with that idea for desire overall, how ‘bout we pick a special squad of desires—like hunger and thirst, the most obvious OG ones?

“aight, let’s snag that squad,” he said.

so one’s flex is food and the other is drink, right?

“yep.”

now here’s the kicker: isn’t thirst just the soul’s basic crave for drink—and drink alone—without any extra sauce (like warm or cold, a lot or a little, or any specific vibe)? but if that thirst shows up with extra heat, then the crave flips to wanting cold drink; or if it’s chillin’ with cold, then it craves warm drink; or if it’s extra AF, then it wants mega sips; and if it’s low-key, then just a small gulp. pure, unfiltered thirst just wants straight-up drink—the natural satisfaction of thirst—just like ordinary hunger is all about food.

“deadass; a simple desire always vibes with a simple object, and a tricked-out desire rolls with a fancy object.”

but yo, here’s where things could get messy: i wanna block any haters from saying that no one craves just any drink—they only want “good drink,” or that no one just wants food—they demand bomb food instead. since “good” is like the universal flex object, a desire will automatically be craving good drink, and the same goes for every other crave.

“yeah, the opponent might drop some lines,” he replied.

anyway, i still stand that in relative terms, some things come with extra qualities on each side while others are just basic—with their matches equally basic.

“yo, i ain’t following that vibe.”

but obviously, the greater is always chillin’ next to the lesser, right?

“facts.”

and like, the mega greater is relative to the ultra less, right?

“def.”

and sometimes it’s the greater compared to the lesser, and even the future greater versus the future lesser?

“facts,” he said.

so it works for more and less, and all those matching terms like double versus half, heavier versus lighter, faster versus slower, hot versus cold, and pretty much all the other relatives. it’s the same deal all around, right?

“yup.”

and yo, ain’t the same rule apply in the sciences? like, the whole point of science is knowledge (if that’s the legit definition), but a specific branch of science is just a particular flavor of knowledge; for example, the science of house-building is its own flex and gets tagged as “architecture.”

“facts.”

because it’s got that one special drip that no other has?

“facts.”

and it’s that drip because its object is uniquely defined—and that goes for all the arts and sciences too, right?

“def.”

alright, so if you’re catchin’ these vibes, you get my original meaning about relatives: if one term of a relation is taken by itself, then the other is too; and if one gets all qualified, the other does as well. i’m not saying that relative terms can’t be totally different, or that the science of health is automatically healthy, or that disease is necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of good and evil are exactly good and evil; i’m just sayin’ that when “science” stops being an absolute term and starts targeting a specific vibe—in this case, the nature of health and disease—it gets defined and is then called not just science, but the science of medicine.

“i totally get it, and i vibe with you.”

so wouldn’t you say that thirst is one of these essentially relative vibes, clearly linked—

“yeah, thirst is all about drink.”

—and that a certain kind of thirst is paired with a certain kind of drink, but pure, unqualified thirst ain’t about being mega or minimal, gourmet or basic, or any specific type—it’s just about drink, plain and simple?

“facts.”

so the soul of someone who’s thirsty, as long as they’re in that crave mode, only wants drink—that’s the only thing they’re hustling for.

“straight up.”

and if you imagine something that pulls a thirsty soul away from drink, then that thing’s gotta be different from the raw, beastly pull of thirst that drags ‘em to guzzle; because, as we already said, the same vibe can’t both push and pull the same part in opposite ways at the same time.

“no way, fam.”

like, you can’t say the archer’s hands are both pushing and pulling the bow simultaneously—one hand’s on the push, and the other’s on the pull.

“preach,” he replied.

but yo, could a dude be thirsty and yet ghost on drinking?

“yup, that happens on the reg,” he said.

and in that sitch, wouldn’t you say there’s one part of the soul yelling “drink up” while another part is like, “nah bro, back off”—with the anti-drink vibe being stronger than the basic thirst pull?

“i’d say so, for sure.”

and that “nah, don’t” vibe comes from reason, while the “yes, please” pull comes straight from passion and even some inner dysfunction?

“clearly.”

so we can peep that there are two separate vibes, and they’re totally different; the one that rides on logic, we can call the rational principle of the soul, and the other—responsible for all that wild love, hunger, thirst, and fluttery desire—we’ll term the irrational or appetitive squad, the hype crew for all sorts of pleasures and satisfactions.

“yeah, we can totally say they’re different,” he agreed.

then let’s lock it in: there are two core principles in the soul. but what about passion, or spirit? is that a third vibe, or just a remix of desire?

“i’m inclined to say—it’s basically akin to desire.”

well, i said, there’s this story i remember and totally put faith in: leontius, the son of aglaion, was cruising up from the piraeus one day, chillin’ under the north wall on the outside, when he peeped a bunch of dead bodies lying around at an execution spot. he got hit with this wild mix of curiosity and major freak-out vibes; for a hot minute he tried to cover his eyes, but then his desire went full beast mode and he forced his lids open, sprinted over to the corpses, and shouted, “yo, ye wretches, feast your eyes on this lit scene!”

“i’ve heard that tale too,” he said.

the moral of the story? sometimes anger goes to war with desire, as if they were two totally different squads.

“facts; that’s the real meaning,” he said.

and honestly, aren’t there tons of times when a dude’s desires go so hard that they overthrow his reason, leaving him cursing himself and mad at the inner chaos? in that internal brawl—which is like a faction war inside a state—his spirit usually sides with reason. i mean, i’ve never seen that passionate element team up with desire when reason says “nah, back off,” and i doubt you’ve ever peeped that in yourself or anyone else.

“deadass, not ever.”

imagine a man thinks he did wrong to someone else; if he’s a high-key noble dude, he won’t even get all riled up about basic suffering like hunger, cold, or any other pain the other might dish out—he’s like, “that’s just how the world rolls,” and his anger won’t even spark.

“facts,” he said.

but when he feels like he’s the one getting wronged, then he starts boiling over, raging hard and aligning with what he believes is true justice; and as he suffers hunger, cold, or other pains, he just gets even more determined to fight, conquer, and level up. his noble spirit won’t chill until he either comes out on top or gets taken down—or until he hears the shepherd’s call (that is, reason) telling his pack to shut it down.

“that example is on point,” he replied, “and in our state, like we said, the auxiliaries were meant to be the watchdogs, listening up to the rulers—their shepherds.”

“i get you,” i said, “but listen up, there’s one more tea drop i want you to peep.”

“what’s up?”

remember how passion or spirit used to seem like just another type of desire? now, we gotta flip that and say, no fam—in the inner drama of the soul, spirit totally teams up with the rational vibe.

“most assuredly.”

but here’s another question: is passion totally different from reason, or is it just a flavor of reason? because if it’s just the latter, then the soul only rocks two vibes—the rational and the concupiscent. or maybe, like how the state has three squads (traders, auxiliaries, counsellors), there might be a third element in the individual soul—passion or spirit—that, when not messin’ with bad educations, naturally backs up reason?

“yep, there’s def a third,” he said.

“yes,” i replied, “if passion—which we already peeped as being different from desire—also stands apart from reason.”

and that’s easy to see: even toddlers are lit with spirit right from birth, while some never really level up to proper reasoning, or do so way later.

“excellent,” i said, “and you can see that same wild passion in straight-up brute animals—further proof that what you’re saying is on point.” and we can totally throw in homer’s words, which we already quoted:

  “he smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,”

‘cause in that line, homer clearly flexed that the brain which dissects the better from the worse is not the same as that unfiltered, raging anger which gets clapped down.

“very true,” he said.

so after all that tossing around, we’ve landed on the fact that the same core vibes in the state also roll in the individual—and they’re three in number.

“exactly.”

so shouldn’t we then conclude that an individual is wise in the same way, and because of that same lit quality that makes a state wise?

“certainly.”

and also, the same quality that pumps courage into the state pumps it into the individual too, and both the state and the individual share the same connection with all the other virtues?

“assuredly.”

and we’d be like, yup, the individual is just as just as the state itself, right?

“that follows, of course.”

let’s not forget that the justice of the state was all about each of its three squads sticking to their own hustle.

“we’re not likely to have forgotten that,” he said.

we must remember that an individual whose different inner qualities all do their own thing is, by definition, just—and handles his own business.

“yes, we gotta remember that too,” he agreed.

and shouldn’t the rational squad—which is wise and takes care of the whole soul—be in charge, while the passionate or spirited squad plays the role of the supportive homie?

“certainly.”

and like we said, the dope fusion of music and gym workouts will sync these vibes up—firing up reason with noble words and lessons, while calming, taming, and civilizing the wild beast of passion with harmony and rhythm.

“quite true,” he said.

and these two, once they’re all nurtured and educated and totally know their roles, will rule over the concupiscent squad—which, let’s be real, is the biggest, hungriest slice of our soul that’s never satisfied. they’ll keep that in check so that when the concupiscent soul, all hyped up on bodily pleasures, tries to break free and boss everyone around, it doesn’t flip the whole human vibe.

“very true,” he agreed.

together, won’t they be the ultimate defenders of the whole soul and body against outside haters—one dropping sage advice and the other throwing down in battle under its leader, fearlessly carrying out his orders?

“true.”

and a dude’s called courageous if his inner spirit holds tight to reason’s commands in both pleasure and pain, knowing exactly what he should or shouldn’t fear.

“right,” he replied.

and we call a person wise when that inner little boss speaks up—knowing what’s best for each of the three parts and for the whole vibe.

“assuredly.”

and wouldn’t you say that a man is temperate if all these elements are in friendly harmony—in which the ruling reason and the supporting spirit and desire all agree that reason should be the boss, without any rebel moves?

“certainly, that’s the true account of temperance in both the state and the individual,” he said.

and for real, i said, we’ve broken down again and again the quality that makes a man just.

“that is very certain.”

so, is justice any less lit in an individual, or does it come in a different flex, or is it exactly the same as we see in the state?

“there’s no difference in my opinion,” he said.

‘cause if any doubt’s still lurking, a few everyday examples will totally flex the truth of what i’m saying.

“what kinda examples you talkin’ about?”

if you ask us, isn’t it obvious that a just state—or a man trained in that vibe—is way less likely than an unjust one to yeet someone’s stash of gold or silver? would anyone even diss that?

“no one,” he replied.

and will a just dude or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege, theft, or straight-up treachery against his friends or his country?

“never.”

nor will he ever break his word when he’s made oaths or agreements?

“impossible.”

and no one’s gonna commit adultery, disrespect their parents, or slack on their religious duties, right?

“no one.”

and that’s because every part of him is busy mindin’ its own business—whether it’s ruling or being ruled.

“exactly.”

so, are you down with the idea that the vibe that makes such men and states lit is justice, or are you lookin’ for another flavor?

“not i, indeed.”

then our dream is totally realized; that wild suspicion we had at the start—that some divine power steered us to the OG form of justice—is now straight-up verified.

“yes, certainly.”

and the whole division of labor—where the carpenter, the shoemaker, and all the citizens stay in their own lanes instead of messin’ with each other’s biz—was just a shadow of justice, and that’s why it was clutch.

“clearly.”

but in real talk, justice is exactly what we described—it’s not about the outward flex of a man, but about his inner core, the true self. a just man never lets his inner squads step on each other’s toes or do someone else’s grind. he straight-up organizes his inner life, becomes his own boss with his own rules, stays at peace with himself; and when he ties together the three inner principles—kind of like the high, low, and mid notes of his soul’s playlist, locked in perfect harmony—he’s no longer a messy mix but one fully tempered and finely tuned. then, when he’s gotta act—whether over property, body care, or in politics or personal biz—he always calls those moves that keep or boost this harmony “just and good,” naming them wisdom, and anything that messes with it he calls “unjust action,” with the vibe behind it labeled as pure ignorance.

“you spitted the absolute truth, socrates.”

mad props; and if we were to say we’ve uncovered the just man and the just state—and the very nature of justice in both—we wouldn’t be lying, right?

“most certainly not.”

so can we say it like that then?

“let’s say so.”

and now, i said, let’s dive into injustice.

“clearly.”

shouldn’t injustice be seen as that chaotic strife that goes down when the three inner squads start meddling with each other—interfering, stepping out of line, and rising up with unauthorized power moves, like a rebellious minion challenging the true boss of the soul? what’s all that confusion but pure injustice, mixed with intemperance, cowardice, ignorance, and every form of vice imaginable?

“exactly so.”

and if we know the low-key nature of justice and injustice, then what it means to act justly or unjustly should be crystal clear, right?

“what are you even saying?”

like, i said, they’re basically like disease and health—the way disease and health vibe in the body, justice and injustice vibe in the soul.

“how do you mean?”

cause, i said, the healthy stuff produces more health, and the unhealth stuff brings on disease.

“facts.”

and just moves cause justice, while wicked moves bring on injustice?

“that is certain.”

and just like the body hits peak health when its parts are all in natural order—and falls into disease when that order’s wrecked—the creation of justice is all about setting up that natural order in the soul, and injustice is when everything’s off-key.

“true.”

and isn’t virtue basically the health, beauty, and overall well-being of the soul, while vice is the sickness, weakness, and ugly mess that drags it down?

“yup.”

and don’t good vibes and habits lead to virtue, while bad ones push you into vice?

“assuredly.”



still our ancient debate about whether justice or injustice is the ultimate flex hasn’t been solved yet: is it more profitable to keep it 100—being straight-up, virtuous, and just, whether the gods and the squad are watching or not—or is it more baller to go full shady as long as you dodge the ban hammer and stay untaxed?

in my honest opinion, socrates, this whole question is straight-up ridiculous. like, when your physical bod is toast—even if you’re living luxuriously with all the gourmet eats, endless drip, and mad stacks—life becomes a total glitch; so can we really be told that if your inner vibe is completely wrecked, life is still worth riding out, as long as you’re free to do whatever chaos you want (except snagging virtue or ditching vice), assuming we’re talking about the same vibes we described?

yes, i said, the question is, as you put it, ridiculous. but since we’re literally this close to peeping the truth in all its clarity, let’s not bail on ourselves along the way.

“certainly not,” he replied.

“come on up here,” i said, “and peep all these different shades of vice—those extra shady flavors that are worth a double-take.”

“i’m right behind you,” he replied. “proceed.”

i said, “our convo’s now peaked like some high tower of deep thought where you can see that virtue is a one-of-a-kind vibe, while vice comes in endless remix versions—there are four extra dank types that totally deserve a shout-out.”

“what do you mean?” he asked.

“i mean,” i replied, “that it looks like the soul comes in as many vibes as there are types of states.”

“how many?”

“there are five flavors for the state, and five for the soul,” i said.

“what are they?”

“first up, it’s the one we’ve been dishing out—something that can be called either monarchy or aristocracy, depending on whether a single boss dude or a crew of legends is running the show.”

“true,” he replied.

“but i’m saying those two names are just two sides of the same coin; whether one guy or a bunch of them are calling the shots, as long as our leaders have been schooled the way we imagined, the core laws of the state stay solid.”

“that is true,” he replied.

book v.

so like, the real and epic city (or state) is built on the same vibes as the genuinely lit human; if that’s on point, then every other model is sus af. the bad vibes aren’t just messing up the state’s setup—they’re totally clogging the individual soul too, and they show up in four extra shady forms.

“what are they?” he asked.

i was about to break down the order in which these four sketchy vibes roll out when polemarchus, chillin’ a little ways off, right past adeimantus, started lowkey whispering to him. he stretched out his hand, grabbed the top of his coat by the shoulder, pulled him in close, and murmured in his ear—i only caught, “shall we ghost him, or what’s the move?”

“certainly not,” said adeimantus, raising his voice.

“who is it,” i said, “that you’re not letting slide?”

“you,” he said.

i repeated, “why me? why am i the one who can’t catch a break?”

“because,” he said, “we lowkey think you’re being lazy and trying to cheat us out of a whole chapter that’s major tea in this story; and you act like your floaty, breezy vibe will let you skate by—as if it’s totally obvious that when it comes to women and kids, ‘friends have all things in common.’”

“and wasn’t i right, adeimantus?”

“yes,” he said, “but what’s right in this sitch, like everything else, has gotta be explained—since community comes in all flavors. so, tell us exactly what kind of community you’re vibing on. we’ve been waiting, like forever, for you to break down the family game of our citizens—how they’re gonna drop kids into the world and level ‘em up once they show, and basically, what the whole vibe is with this women-and-children community—because we’re convinced that how you manage that stuff flips the state for the better or the worse. and now that this question is still a hot mess, and you’re out here building another state, we’ve decided, as you heard, that we’re not letting you bounce until you drop all the deets.”

to that, glaucon said, “bet, consider me down with that resolution.”

“and without more ado,” said thrasymachus, “just know we’re all equally vibing with this.”

i said, “you have no clue what you’re doing attacking my flow—what insane lines are you throwing about the state?! i was so ready to wrap up this topic and was feeling hella blessed that you were all about my words, and then you hit me asking to rewind all the way back to the foundation—as if you didn’t stir up a whole hornet’s nest of words. i saw the drama coming from a mile away and dodged it.”

“for what purpose do you reckon we’re here,” said thrasymachus, “—to hunt for gold or to vibe with some deep discourse?”

“yes, but even the dopest convo should have some limits.”

“exactly, socrates,” said glaucon, “wise folks set life itself as the only real limit on listening to deep talks. but anyway, don’t worry about us; take heart and drop your own take: what kind of women-and-children community is gonna roll with our guardians? and how are we gonna handle that tricky stretch between birth and full-on education? dish out the deets.”

“yes, my simple friend, but the answer here is anything but a walk in the park; there are so many more doubts popping up than in our earlier convos. not only can we question if what we’re saying is even doable, but also whether it’d actually be the ultimate glow-up for the state. so i’m lowkey hesitant to jump in, afraid that our big dream might just turn out to be an epic meme.”

“fear not,” he replied, “your crew isn’t gonna roast you—they’re not here to throw shade or be hostile.”

“my good friend,” i said, “i guess you’re tryna hype me up with that talk.”

“yes,” he said.

“but let me be real—you’re doing the opposite of hyping me up. your encouragement would be lit if i already had my facts straight. dropping truth bombs about stuff mad important that we all revere among our wise squad shouldn’t come with doubt; but trying to argue when you’re just a hesitating enquirer—which is totally my vibe right now—is risky and mad slippery. and the danger isn’t even that i’ll get roasted (that’d be so kiddie), but that i might totally miss the truth when i need rock-solid footing, and then drag my homies down with me. i seriously hope nemesis doesn’t come through with savage comebacks on my words, cuz i lowkey believe that accidentally offing someone is a way lesser crime than being a faker when talking about beauty, goodness, or justice in the laws. and that’s a risk i’d rather take facing haters than my own squad—so props for the hype.”

glaucon laughed and said, “well then, socrates, if you and your argument ever seriously mess with us, consider yourself pre-cleared from any accidental homicide charges and no one’ll call you a faker; so get in there and spit your truth, bro.”

“well,” i said, “the law says that once a dude is acquitted he’s off the hook, and what’s solid in court should totally hold in our debate too.”

“then why stress?”

“well,” i replied, “i guess i gotta rewind and say what i should’ve dropped earlier in the right order. the bros’ part is wrapped, and now it’s time to spotlight the ladies. i’m ready to spill the tea, especially since y’all are hyping it up.”

for dudes born and schooled like our peeps, the only way, in my honest opinion, to nail the real story on handling and vibing with women and kids is to bounce back to our original blueprint—remember when we said the bros were gonna be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd?

“true.”

“now, let’s also assume that the birth and schooling of our ladies is run under similar—or near similar—rules; then we can see if the final drip matches our master plan.”

“what do you mean?”

“i mean,” i explained, “let’s put it like this: do dogs roll as strictly dudes and chicks, or do they both share the hustle equally when it comes to hunting, guarding, and all the other doggo duties? or do we just hand off all the herding and protection vibes to the male pups, leaving the females at home under the presumption that carrying and nursing puppies is enough work for them?”

“no,” he said, “they split the hustle; the only diff is that the male pups are beefier and the female pups are less buff.”

“but can you swap different animals for the same gig if they aren’t raised and fed the same way?”

“you totally can’t.”

“so, if the ladies are down for the same duties as the dudes, they gotta get the same nurturing and schooling, right?”

“yes.”

“and the schooling the dudes got was all about music and gym time.”

“yes.”

“so does that mean the ladies should also be schooled in music, gym, and even the art of war—doing it just like the bros?”

“that’s the inference, i guess.”

“i’d actually expect that some of our wild proposals, if pulled off, might look straight-up absurd.”

“no doubt of it.”

“yes, and the most ridiculous move of all would be peeping women going shirtless in the palaestra, working out with the dudes—especially when they aren’t exactly in their prime; they wouldn’t exactly be serving looks any more than those hyped old men who, even with wrinkles and less-than-fresh vibes, still hit the gymnasia.”

“yes, indeed,” he said, “by today’s standards, that idea would be totally cringe.”

“but then,” i said, “since we’re all about keeping it 100 and speaking our minds, we shouldn’t sweat the roast from the smart alecks who are gonna clap back about this innovation—talking smack about women’s skills in music and gym, and especially about them donning armour and riding horses like total badasses!”

“very true,” he replied.

“yet having started, we gotta slide into the real-deal, rough spots of the law—and straight-up ask these dudes, for once in their lives, to get serious. not long ago, as a throwback we’ll remind ‘em, the hellenes believed (and the barbarians still kinda do) that the sight of a naked dude was totally cringe and improper; and when the cretans and then the lacedaemonians first dropped that custom, even the brainy folks of the day would’ve roasted that new trend.”

“no doubt.”

“but when experience showed that letting everything hang open was way better than covering it up—and that the laughable exterior completely faded in the face of the smarter vibe of reason—then it was clear that a dude was just plain foolish if he aimed his savage roasts at anything other than obvious foolishness and vice, or if he tried judging beauty by any standard other than pure goodness.”

“very true,” he replied.

“so first, whether we’re clowning or getting serious, let’s break down the nature of woman: is she totally, partially, or not at all able to vibe with the same moves as men? and can she flex in the art of war at all? that’s the smartest way to kick off our inquiry, and it’ll probably lead us to the fairest truth.”

“that’s def the move.”

“shall we flip it and start by arguing against ourselves, so the opponents’ side isn’t left completely undefended?”

“why not?” he said.

“then let’s ghost a speech out of our opponents’ mouths. they’d be like: ‘socrates and glaucon, no haters need to call you out because, right from the jump, you admitted that everybody should stick to the hustle that vibes with their own nature.’ and honestly, we did say that. ‘and don’t men’s and women’s vibes differ madly, right?’ and we’d shoot back, ‘oh for sure, they do.’ then they’d ask, ‘shouldn’t the gigs assigned to men and women be different to suit those diff vibes?’ and of course, they should. ‘but if that’s the case, haven’t you totally contradicted yourselves by saying that men and women—whose vibes are totally diff—should perform the same moves?’ – so what defense are you gonna bring for us, my dude, against anyone throwing these objections?”

“that ain’t an easy question to answer on the fly; so i’m beggin’ you to help unpack our side.”

“these are the objections, glaucon, and there’s a bunch more of the same that i peeped ages ago—they made me mad nervous about drafting any law regarding the possession and schooling of women and children.”

“by zeus,” he said, “this problem is anything but easy.”

“yeah, i said, but when a dude’s in over his head—whether he’s splashing around in a kiddie pool or drowning in the middle of the ocean—he’s gotta keep swimming, no cap.”

“very true.”

“and aren’t we supposed to swim hard for the shore? maybe hope that arion’s dolphin or some other epic assist shows up to save our vibe?”

“i suppose so,” he said.

“well then, let’s see if there’s any escape route. didn’t we already agree that different vibes should chase diff hustles, and that men’s and women’s natures are, like, totally different? and now, what are we saying—are we claiming that different vibes should have the same gigs? that’s the inconsistency everyone’s throwing at us.”

“precisely.”

“yo, glaucon,” i said, “wild is the power of tossing out contradictions, no cap!”

“why u say that?” he asked.

“‘cuz i feel like so many dudes end up arguing even when they don’t mean to. they think they’re deep in reasoning, but they’re really just picking a fight—because they can’t even lock down what they’re talking about; they’re all about that petty verbal beef instead of a legit discussion.”

“yes,” he replied, “that happens way too often; but how does that plug into our debate?”

“a whole lot,” i said, “because there’s a real risk we might accidentally slide into a full-on word war.”

“like, how exactly?”

“‘cuz we go all out defending the verbal truth that different natures should chase diff hustles, yet we never even defined what ‘sameness’ or ‘difference’ in nature really means, or why we split them up when assigning different gigs versus the same gigs.”

“nah,” he said, “we never even touched on that.”

“imagine this for a sec—if we said there’s a natural diff between bald dudes and hairy dudes, and if we declare bald dudes as cobblers, then wouldn’t we have to ban hairy dudes from being cobblers, and vice versa?”

“that’d be a straight-up joke,” he said.

“yes, i said—a total meme; and why? cuz when we built the state, we never meant for nature’s differences to cover every little thing—only the differences that actually affect the hustle someone’s in. like, a legit doctor and someone who dreams of being a doctor are basically in the same lane.”

“true.”

“but a doctor and a carpenter? totally different vibes.”

“certainly.”

“and if, i said, the male and female vibes seem diff when it comes to any art or hustle, then sure, we could say that hustle should be assigned to one over the other; but if the only diff is that women bear kids and men beget them, that ain’t a legit reason to say a woman deserves a different education—so we’re sticking to the idea that our guardians and their wifeys should roll with the same gigs.”

“deadass, very true,” he said.

“next, let’s ask our opponent: regarding any civic hustle or art, how is a woman’s vibe even different from a man’s?”

“that’s totally fair.”

“and maybe he’ll say that spitting an answer off the bat is hard; but after a lil’ brain grind, it all becomes clear.”

“yeah, maybe.”

“so, let’s invite him to join our convo, and show him there’s literally nothing weird in the makeup of women that would mess with how they run the state.”

“by all means.”

“let’s be real with him: ‘come on, let’s get this—when you talked about someone being naturally gifted or not, did you mean that one dude picks stuff up on fleek while another struggles, or that a bit of study makes one drop mad knowledge while the other forgets ASAP? or did you mean that one dude’s bod is a boss for his mind while another’s just in the way? aren’t these exactly the diff factors that separate the naturally gifted from the non-gifted?’”

“no one can deny that.”

“and can you name any hustle where dudes don’t have these skills on a next-level game compared to chicks? do i really need to drop the deets on weaving, or how ladies totally crush it at whipping up pancakes and preserves—where for a man to outdo a woman would be, like, the most absurd thing ever?”

“you’re right,” he replied, “in saying that generally the female vibe is seen as lower—though plenty of women outshine many men in specific areas, overall your point stands.”

“so, my friend,” i said, “there’s no special state-management perk that a woman gets just ‘cause she’s a woman, or that a man gets just ‘cause he’s a man—the natural gifts are spread out the same in both; every hustle dudes do, women can do too, though, on the whole, a woman might lag behind a man in that game.”

“very true,” he said.

“then are we supposed to force all our rules on dudes and leave women off the hook?”

“that will never do.”

“like, one woman might have mad healing skills while another doesn’t; one might be a dope musician while another’s totally tone-deaf, right?”

“very true.”

“and one woman could slay in gym and military drills while another is totally anti-war and despises gym—facts.”

“certainly.”

“and one woman might be a boss philosopher while another straight-up ghosts philosophy; one’s full of spirit and another is, like, spiritless.”

“that’s also true.”

“so, one lady might have what it takes to be a guardian and another might not. wasn’t the selection of our male guardians based on these kinds of diff traits too?”

“yes.”

“both dudes and chicks have the qualities needed to be guardians—they just differ in how much they flex, capacity-wise.”

“obviously.”

“and the ladies who do have those vibes should be picked to roll as companions and squad-mates with the dudes who match their skills and character, right?”

“very true.”

“and shouldn’t similar vibes be chasing the same gigs?”

“they def should.”

“so, as we were saying before, there’s nothing off about schooling the guardians’ wives in music and gym—so here we are, coming full circle.”

“certainly not.”

“the rules we dropped back then were totally in line with nature, so they weren’t just wishful thinking; and the upside-down way things are done now is basically a violation of nature.”

“that seems totally on point.”

“we had to check two things first: could our proposals even work, and are they actually the best move?”

“yes.”

“and the possibility’s been acknowledged?”

“yes.”

“now next up, we gotta prove that the benefits are hella major.”

“definitely.”

“you gotta admit that the same lit education that turns a dude into a solid guardian will do the same for a chick, since their core vibes are identical, right?”

“yes.”

yo, imma hit u with a question, no cap.

whatchu sayin'?

so, u think all dudes are vibin' on the same level, or is one dude flexin' harder than the rest?

definitely the latter.

and in our lit state buildup, u vibin' that our guardians—trained on that next-level drip model—are total perfect gs, or are they just those basic clowns whose schooling is straight-up DIY?

lol, that question is straight-up clownin', fr.

u already clapped back, i answered: yo, and can we add that our guardians are the ultimate citizens, hands down?

big flex, indeed.

and their wifeys? ain't they gonna be the top-tier babes?

hella yes, def the best.

and is there anything more lit for the state than having all the peeps maxed out on awesomeness?

no cap, nothing's better.

so, our vibes in music and gym time, when done our way, gonna drop that fire, right?

for sure.

so, we just dropped a law that's not only doable but mega boostin' for our state, right?

facts.

then let our guardians' wifeys get lit and drop it like it's hot—their virtue is their swag, ya dig? and let them ride shotgun in the war game and defend our turf; though when it comes to the grind, the lighter loads get handed to the ladies ’cause their vibe’s a bit softer, but overall, they’re on the same hustle. and yo, for any dude clownin' at naked babes breakin' a sweat for the realest reasons, his laugh is like he’s pluckin' some unripe fruit of cringe wisdom—and he’s straight-up clueless about what he’s crackin’ up at, lost in the sauce. real talk, that’s the ultimate tweet: what’s beneficial is pure gold and what’s harmful is mad trash.

real talk.

so check it: here's a glitch in our women-law that we just dodged—the fact that we didn’t get totally yeeted by the wave for sayin’ guardians of both sexes gotta share all their moves. the self-consistency of our argument proves that this setup is both mega useful and on the real possibility tip.

yeah, that was a massive wave, and u totally dodged it, my dude.

i was like, true, but brace yourself—a bigger wave is comin'; u ain't even ready for what’s next.

spill it, fam; lemme peep.

so here’s the next level law: our guardians' wifeys are communal, and their kiddos are too, like full squad-sharing—no one gets to flex as “my kid” or “my man.” it’s all mix-n-match, capiche?

yeah, he was like, that's a way bigger wave, and both the possibility and the perks of that law are hella sus.

i was like, fr, the ups of sharing wifeys and kiddos are lit beyond debate; but whether it's even doable is a whole different meme that’ll spark mad debate.

i reckon there’s a ton of doubts on both counts.

u tryna mix the issues, i replied. i meant, just own up that the benefits are fire; then i could yeet one problem away and just deal with the possibility part later.

lol, but that move was spotted, so now u gotta drop a defense for both.

aight, i admitted, i’m ridin’ with fate. but do me a lil’ solid: let me vibe on a daydream, like those lone dreamers who feast on fantasy while strolling solo; cuz before they figure out any real hack to make wishes come true—which never even bugs 'em—they just assume their ultimate flex is already in the bag and then sketch out all the epic plans for when it finally drops. that way, they don’t even stress too much about stuff that was never that valuable to begin with. ngl, i'm kinda feelin' the burnout, so with your blessing, imma skip the deep dive on possibility for now. assuming our proposal is on fleek possible, imma break down how our boss-level rulers gonna run this show and prove that the plan is the ultimate state upgrade for both the state and our guardians. first up, if u cool with it, lemme flex on the benefits of this move; and then we’ll come back to the possibility question.

i’m down, go off.

first, i think that if our rulers and their ride-or-die crew are gonna live up to that boss label, one squad’s gotta be chill and follow the laws, while the others flex serious command energy. our guardians must not only obey the laws but also mirror that vibe in every tiny deet they handle.

facts, he said.

i told him, u, as our lawmaker, picked the dudes; now u gotta pick the ladies and pair ’em up. they gotta be as similar in vibe as possible, live in shared cribs, and grub together at common meals. nothing’s gonna be just “mine”—they’re all in this together, raised as one squad, even when sweatin' it out at gym time. naturally, their natures will pull 'em into hooking up—“necessity” is the word, though not the math-y kind, but that real, heart-throb need that all lovers know, binding the masses hard.

yeah, he said—necessity, not like geometry, but that fire attraction that even the most basic loves vibe with.

real talk, i said; and this, glaucon, like all the rest, has gotta roll out in an orderly fashion. in our blessed city, all that licentious chaos is strictly banned.

for sure, he said—it absolutely cannot fly.

next up, we gotta make matrimony sacred to the max, turning the ultimate benefits into something holy, right?

exactly.

and how do we level up marriages to be the most beneficial?—i’m askin' cuz i peep your crib, where you got huntin' dogs and some fancy birds on deck. so, spill it: ever peeped how u pair up and breed 'em?

in what like details?

like, first off, even though they’re all dope, aren’t some just extra fire compared to others?

facts.

do u just mix 'em all up, or do u only roll with the top-tier ones?

only the best, obviously.

so, u pick the OGs or the ones who are vibe-ripe?

i only roll with those perfectly aged.

and if u slack on the breeding game, your dogs and birds would totally downgrade, right?

for sure.

and the same goes for horses and all those critters?

no doubt.

omg, fam, i said, imagine the mad skill our rulers gotta have if the same vibe applies to us humans!

for real, same principle holds; but why call for extra skill?

cuz, i said, our rulers are gonna have to flex on the collective body using some serious med moves. u know, when folks just need a chill regimen, a basic doc will do; but when it comes to droppin’ the real meds, the doctor gotta be the ultimate one.

facts, he said; but what’re u gettin’ at?

i meant, i replied, that our rulers will need to dish out a serious dose of slick moves and maybe even a lil’ white lie or two for the crew’s benefit: basically, using all these “medicine” moves can actually be a power play.

and we were bang on.

and this lawfully approved hack will likely be needed big time to keep marriages and baby-making on point.

how so?

cuz, i said, the rule’s already dropped that the top-tier peeps should link up with top-tier peeps as much as possible, and the basic ones with the basic ones as rarely as possible; and only the offspring of the top matches should be raised, if we want our flock to stay first-rate. these moves gotta be kept on the DL by the rulers, or else our whole guardian squad might just flip and riot.

word.

so why not throw down some epic festivals where brides and grooms come together, with dope sacrifices and killer wedding tracks dropped by our poet squad? the number of weddings should be left to the rulers’ discretion—their mission is to keep the population perfectly balanced. plus, they gotta consider other crazy factors like wars, diseases, and all that extra drama to keep our state from getting either too extra or way too chill.

for sure, he replied.

we might have to whip up some ingenious lottery for the less lit ones to draw every time we bring everyone together, so they can just blame bad luck and not the rulers.

true dat, he said.

and i reckon that our baddest and top-tier youngins, aside from racking up honors and rewards, should score some major hookup perks with wifeys; their bravery is a flex, and such dads should be stackin’ sons by the truckload.

facts.

and the legit officer spots, whether dude, chick, or both, gotta be filled by both women and men—

yep—

the proper squad will scoop up the kiddos of top-tier parents to the crib or fold, and drop ‘em off with certified nurses stationed in a separate chill zone; but the offspring of the basic ones—or even of the top ones if they end up deformed—will be shipped off to some mysterious, off-the-grid spot, just as it should be.

for real, he said, that’s a must if we wanna keep our guardian breed pure.

they’ll handle the baby care, rounding up the moms when they’re milked to the max, making sure no mama recognizes her own mini, and if more wet-nurses are needed, they’ll scoop in extra help. they’ll also keep the nursing sesh short and sweet; no crazy night shifts for the moms—the nurses and attendants take care of that drama.

u think our guardians’ wifeys are gonna have it super chill when makin' babies?

exactly, i said, and they should. but yo, let’s roll on with our master plan. we were sayin' that the parents should be in their prime, right?

hella true.

so, what’s prime? can we say it’s like, 20 years for a chick and 30 for a dude?

which ages you chattin' about?

i said, a chick can start droppin’ state kiddos at 20 and keep it goin' until 40; a dude can start at 25—when his life’s vibe is at its peak—and keep begettin’ minis until he hits 55.

for sure, he said, both dudes and chicks rock their prime in those age ranges, full of physical and brainpower vibes.

basically, anyone outside those age brackets jumpin’ into the public wedding vibes is straight-up doin’ something off—an unholy move. and if their kid somehow makes it to life, it’s conceived under vibes totally unlike the legit sacrifices and prayers that every wedding priestess, priest, and the whole city drops, aiming for a new gen that's better and more useful than their solid parents; meanwhile, his kid ends up being all dark and sus.

deadass true, he replied.

and the same law hits anyone in the prime who links up with a prime chick without the rulers' blessing; we’ll straight-up call that guy out for raisin’ a bastard—uncertified and unconsecrated for the state.

so true, he replied.

this rule applies only to folks in that prime range; beyond that, they get free rein—except a dude can’t marry his daughter or his daughter’s daughter, or his mom or his mom’s mom; and a chick can’t marry her son or her dad, or her grandson or her granddad—and so on both ways. plus, we drop strict orders to block any rogue embryos from even seein' the light; and if someone forces a birth, the parents gotta know that the offspring isn’t sustainable and must be sorted out accordingly.

that’s a solid proposition, he said. but how will they even know who’s a dad and who’s a daughter, etc.?

they’ll never really know. here’s the tea: from the day of the wedding bash, the groom from that day will call all the male kiddos born in the 7th and 10th months afterward his sons, and all the female kiddos his daughters. they all call him “dad,” he calls their kids his grandkids, and the elder squad gets dubbed “grandfathers and grandmothers.” everyone born when their parents linked up is treated as siblings—and, like i said, they're banned from marrying each other. but yo, this isn’t a total ban on bro-sis hookups; if the RNG is on their side and they snag the pythian oracle’s blessing, the law lets it slide.

preach, he replied.

that’s the play, glaucon: our guardians are gonna share their wifeys and fams on the communal grind. now, u’d agree that this setup fits solidly with our whole state vibe, and nothing can be a bigger flex than that, right?

def, no cap.

so, how about we find a common ground by askin': what’s the main hustle of a lawmaker when buildin' a state—what’s the ultimate good and the worst evil—and then peep whether our setup is stamped with that good vibe or that evil clout?

bet.

is there any more savage evil than chaos and constant distractions when unity should reign? or any bigger good than that dope bond of unity?

nah, nothing beats that.

and unity’s real when the whole squad shares the same highs and lows—when every citizen is hyped or low-key bummed together over the same joys or sorrows.

facts.

and if everyone’s just livin’ on their own private vibes, the state falls apart—like, half the squad is flexin’ while the other half is stuck in tears over the same city drama.

for sure.

most drama comes from squabbles over what’s “mine” and “not mine,” what’s “his” and “not his.”

preach.

isn’t the ultimate squad thing a state where everyone’s on the same page about “mine” and “not mine” for the same stuff?

no cap, true.

or think of it like the ultimate body: if one dude’s finger gets hurt, the whole squad feels that burn and rallies as one kingdom, showing mad empathy for that part—like we say the man’s got a pain in his finger; and the same goes for every part that feels pain or joy when the hurt chills out.

deadass true, he replied; and i’m with u that in a bomb state, everyone’s on the same vibe.

so when any citizen catches a good vibe or a bad trip, the whole state’s gonna feel it—rejoicing together or getting down together, right?

exactly, he said—that’s the move in a well-ordered state.

alright, i said, now it's time to peep our own state again and see whether this style or some other form totally vibes with these core principles.

mad good.

our state, like any other, got rulers and subjects?

true.

and they all call each other citizens?

of course.

but in other states, don’t peeps call their rulers something else?

usually they call 'em masters, but in democracies, they just say rulers.

and in our state, what extra name do the peeps drop for the rulers besides “citizens?”

they’re hailed as saviours and helpers, he replied.

and what do the rulers call the squad?

their maintainers and foster-dads.

and in other states?

slaves.

and how do rulers refer to one another elsewhere?

as fellow-rulers.

and in our state?

fellow-guardians.

ever peeped a case in another state where a ruler calls one of his homies his friend and another not even his friend?

yeah, all the time.

and the friend’s the one he vibes with, while the other’s just a stranger, zero interest?

exactly.

but would any of our guardians ever call another guardian a stranger?

nah, for sure not; anyone they meet is straight-up treated as a brother or sister, a dad or a mom, a son or a daughter, or as kin connected in some way.

word, i said; but let me ask one more time: will they just be a family in name only, or will they all actually live that fam life? like, when we say “father,” does it mean he cares, commands mad respect, and gets all the duties the law drops on him? and if someone disses that duty, are they gonna be seen as impious, unrighteous, and not get any blessings from god or the squad? is that what every kid is gonna hear on the daily from everyone about who counts as their parents and kin?

that's it, and nothing else; cuz what’s more ridiculous than just spittin’ family names without ever livin’ the fam life?

so in our city, the lingo of harmony and vibe will blast louder than anywhere else. like i said before, whether someone’s chill or wrecked, the universal call will be “i’m good” or “i’m not good.”

mad true.

and if we're on that wavelength, weren't we sayin’ that everyone shares the same highs and lows?

yes, and they'll all be in this together.

and they'll all be vibin' on one common interest that they all call “mine,” and because of that, they’ll share the same feelin' of joy and pain?

yes, way more so than in any other state.

and the big reason for this, beyond just the basic state setup, is that our guardians will have a community of wifeys and kiddos?

exactly—that’s the huge flex.

and this unity of feelin' we already agreed is the ultimate good, like how a well-ordered state is just like a body where every part feels every ache and joy as one?

yeah, totally.

so, the communal setup of wifeys and kiddos among our citizens is clearly the source of the biggest good for our state?

absolutely, no cap.

and this jives with our other rule that our guardians aren’t gonna own cribs or land or any property; their only drip is the food they get from the squad, and they keep zero private expenses—cuz we wanna keep them 100% on that guardian grind.

word, he replied.

both the community of property and the community of families, as i’m saying, make our squad of guardians way more legit; they ain’t gonna tear the city apart over “mine” vs. “not mine” – like, no cap, each bro won’t just yeet his scores into his own crib with his separate bae, kids, and private drama; nah, everyone’s vibing on the same feels about what’s real and precious, so they all pull toward one epic goal.

bet, he replied.

and since these peeps got nothin’ but themselves to call their own, no petty lawsuits or drama will ever pop off between them; they’ll be totally freed from all that beef sparked by cash, kiddos, or fam ties.

fr, of course they will.

plus, there’ll never be any trial for throwing fists or throwing shade among them. cuz, like, equals gotta guard themselves against equals – that's the 100% honor flex; protecting your homie is an absolute must.

lit, he said.

yes; and there’s another sick perk in the law: if one dude catches mad beef with another, he’s gonna drop that resentment right then and there, instead of escalating into some hella dangerous move.

facts.

the older OG gets the duty of ruling and schooling the youngins.

no doubt.

and, like, it’s obvious that the young squad won’t throw hands or do any wild trash on an elder unless the law crew gives the green light; nor will they disrespect their elders in any way. cuz there are two major bouncers – shame, which keeps you from clapping your own parental figures, and fear, that the hurt one will get mad backup from his bros, sons, and dads.

facts, he replied.

then, do our laws help the citizens keep it chill with each other?

yup, there will be zero lack of peace.

and since our guardians are totally squad goals and won’t beef among themselves, there’s no way the rest of the city is gonna split into camps against them or each other.

none.

i don’t even wanna call out the petty bs they’ll dodge – like, the basic flex of the broke peeps flattering the rich, plus all the cringe struggles of raising a fam, hustling for cash to cop the essentials, borrowing then ghosting on repayments, scraping for coin and handing it off to wenches and slaves to hold – all those mad evils are so basic and low-key that they aren’t even worth spilling the tea about.

facts, he said – you don’t even need x‑ray vision to peep that.

and from all that cringe, they’ll be totally freed, living a life as epic as olympic winners – and then some.

how tho?

like, i said, olympic victors are only flexing a slice of the mega blessed life that our citizens score; our peeps have clinched a way more glorious win that saves the whole state, and the crown they rock – passed down to their mini‑mes – is basically the full kit of life’s swag; they snag rewards from the squad while they’re here, and even get an epic send‑off when they dip.

facts, he said – and those rewards are straight‑up glorious.

remember, i said, how earlier some nameless hater accused us of making our guardians salty – they had nothin’ but could’ve had it all – and we clapped back that, if the moment was right, we might chat about it later, but for now we’re all in on turning our guardians into the real mvp’s and building our state for the ultimate happiness of the whole squad, not just a single clique?

facts, i remember.

so, what you say now that the life of our protectors is portrayed as way better and nobler than that of olympic winners – is the grind of shoemakers or any other artisans or even agri hustlers ever gonna compare?

nah, fr.

plus, i gotta rehash what i mentioned before – if any guardian tries to chase a happiness vibe so hard that he bails on his guardian duty, and isn’t down with this safe, harmonious life (which we lowkey believe is the dopest life ever) but instead gets all caught up in some naive hustle of happiness and tries to jack the entire state for himself, then he needs to get woke to hesiod’s drip: “half is more than the whole.”

if he slid into my dms for advice, i’d be like: “bruh, just stay right where you are and soak up this lit life vibe.”

you down with the idea, i said, that dudes and dudettes gotta roll with the same lifestyle we just described—shared education, shared mini‑mes; and they gotta keep an eye on the citizens together, whether chilling in the city or storming off to war; they’re gonna squad up to guard and even hunt like pack pups; and in everything, as long as they can, the ladies are riding with the dudes. by doing that, they’re doing what’s best and keeping it real, preserving the natural balance between the sexes.

yeah, i’m with that, he replied.

i said, the only tea left is – can we actually pull off this squad life among humans like it happens among animals, and if so, how do we even do that?

dang, you already read my mind, he replied.

obviously, i said, there’s zero cap in figuring out how they’ll throw down in war.

how tho?

like, obviously, they’ll roll out on expeditions together and bring along any of their mini‑mes who are strong enough – just like the apprentice vibes where the artisan’s kid peeps at the grind they’ll have to master later; not just watching, but actually helping out in the war and serving their pa and ma. haven’t you peeped how potter’s boys start assisting long before they even hit the wheel?

yup, i gotchu.

and, like, do you think potters are extra careful schooling their kids and letting them peep and practice their hustle more than our guardians will be?

that’s totally bogus, he said.

plus, having your kiddos around gives your parents major inspiration to be all valorous – like in the animal kingdom where the lil’ ones are the ultimate hype for courage.

facts, socrates; but if they get wrecked in war – and that lowkey happens – the danger is real: not only the parents but the kiddos will get caught in the crossfire, and the state might never bounce back.

true, i said; but are you saying they should never take any wild risks?

nah, not at all.

but yo, if they gotta risk it, shouldn’t they do it on a day when, if they dodge a disaster, they’ll come out even stronger?

facts.

like, whether the future soldiers catch a glimpse of war in their youth is mega important – a little risk is totally worth it for that glow‑up.

yup, very important.

so, our first move is to make our kiddos vibe as spectators of war; but we also gotta set them up safe from danger – then everything’s chill.

facts.

their parents aren’t oblivious to the risks of war – they lowkey know, as much as any human can, which missions are safe and which ones are sketchy.

say no more.

and they’ll book the safe missions and be hella cautious with the dangerous ones?

facts.

plus, they’ll put the kiddos under the wing of seasoned vets who’ll be their absolute leaders and mentors.

deadass.

still, we can’t always foresee war’s wild randomness – there’s mad chance in play, no cap.

facts.

so to flex against that randomness, our kiddos gotta be literally fitted with wings, so when the heat is on they can yeet outta danger in a flash.

what kinda wings, tho? he asked.

i mean, we gotta mount them on horses early AF; and once they learn to ride, take ‘em on horseback missions to peep some war vibes. these horses aren’t gonna be wild or extra – they should be chill, super tractable, yet the swiftest rides on the block. this way, the kids get a solid preview of their future grind; and if danger pops off, they just follow their OG leaders and make a clean getaway.

bet, you’re right, he replied.

next up, how should our soldiers treat each other and their foes? i’m thinking that any soldier who bails on his rank, tosses his arms, or shows any sign of straight‑up cowardice should get demoted to a mere peasant or artisan. what do you say?

fr, i’m totally on board.

and the dude who lets himself get captured can straight‑up be handed over as a gift to the enemy squad – he’s basically legit their prey now, so let them do whatever savage moves they wanna do.

facts.

but for the hero who’s been absolutely lit on the battlefield, what do we do? first off, he gets mad honor from his youthful comrades – each one taking turns to crown him as the boss. what d’ya think?

i’m down with that.

and how ‘bout giving him that right-hand-of-fellowship vibe?

yeah, that’s a vibe too, i agree.

but bet you won’t dig my next idea.

what’s your proposal?

i propose that he should be all up in the kissing game – dishing out kisses and getting kissed back.

most definitely. i’d even go further and say: let anyone he’s down to kiss be totally game during the expedition. so if there’s a bae in the army – whether young or maiden – they’ll be extra hyped to bag that valor prize.

legendary, i said. it’s already on record that a brave dude gets more wifey options than the others, plus he gets first dibs so he can rack up mad kids.

bet.

plus, homer says brave youths should get mad honors in another way; like, he drops the story of ajax, who after totally flexing on the battlefield, got rewarded with “long chines” – a shoutout that was totally on point for a hero in his prime, both a badge of honor and a mega power-up.

facts, he said.

so in that vibe, i said, homer’s our ultimate guru; and we too, during sacrifices and similar epic moments, will honor the brave – dudes and dudettes alike – with fire hymns and all those dope distinctions we mentioned; plus with “prime seats, bomb feasts, and overflowing chalices;” and by honoring them, we’re also leveling up their training.

that’s dope, he replied.

yep, i said; and when a dude dies gloriously in war, shouldn’t we first drop that he’s part of the golden squad?

definitely.

nah, but don’t we have hesiod’s word that when they dip, “they’re like holy angels on the earth, authors of good, busters of evil, the guardians of the speech‑gifted” peeps?

facts; and we’re all in on his authority.

we gotta peep the god’s instructions on how to handle the burials of our divine, heroic legends and what special flex they get – and do it all as he commands.

sure thing.

and in the ages ahead, we’ll be out here showing mad respect, kneeling by their tombs like we do at the graves of legends. and not just them – anyone deemed ultra‑good, whether they dip from old age or otherwise, gets the same epic honors.

that’s facts, he said.

next up, how are our soldiers supposed to treat their enemies? what about this?

what exactly are you vibing about?

first off, on the topic of slavery – you think it’s cool for hellenes to enslave other hellenic states or let others enslave them, if they can dodge it? shouldn’t their default be to spare their own, since if they don’t, the whole crew might one day fall under the barbarians’ yoke?

spare ‘em is infinitely better.

so no hellene should ever be owned as a slave; that’s a rule they gotta stick to – and also preach to all fellow hellenes.

facts, he said; that way the squad stays united against the barbarians and they keep their hands off each other.

next, about the fallen – shouldn’t the conquerors only grab their enemy’s armor and nothing extra? like, looting their foe gives a lame excuse to bail on the real fight. softies creep around the dead, pretending they’re on duty, and countless armies have been wrecked by that mad love of plunder.

facts.

and ain’t it super wack and greedy to rob a corpse – plus straight‑up petty and, like, unmanly to mess with the dead when the real enemy already dipped, leaving only his gear behind? it’s like a dog, unable to get at his attacker, barking at the rocks that hit him instead.

totally, like a whole dog vibe, he said.

so we gotta chill with looting the dead or messing with their burial rites, right?

yup, he replied – we absolutely gotta do that.

nor should we sacrifice arms at the temples of the gods – especially not the arms of hellenes – if we wanna keep good vibes with fellow hellenes; plus, we legit gotta worry that handing over spoils snatched from your own fam might cause a major poll unless the god himself gives the nod.

facts.

and again, what’s the move on wrecking hellenic lands or torching houses?

can i get your hot take, he said?

i say both should be totally banned; i’d only snag the annual harvest – and nothing extra. wanna know why?

spill the tea.

check it – there’s a diff in the words “discord” and “war,” and i bet there’s a diff in their vibes too; one’s all about internal, home‑base drama, while the other’s external, foreign beef. so we call the internal mess discord, and only label the external clash as war.

that's a proper diff, he replied.

and can i also note that the hellenic squad is totally united by blood and friendship, and is super alien to those barbarians?

mad good, he said.

so when hellenes throw down with barbarians (or vice versa), we label that as war – natural enemies through and through; but when hellenes clash with each other, we’re just looking at mad disorder and discord, cuz they’re naturally pals – so that beef gets called discord.

i'm with that.

so, think about it, i said, when that recognized discord goes down and a city gets split – if both sides trash each other’s lands and torch each other’s cribs, how trash does that strife look! no true country bae would ever tear into his own nurturer and home; maybe a conqueror can cut off the crops of the conquered, but deep down, they’d still keep that peace vibe and wouldn’t be about endless fighting.

facts, he said – that’s a way cooler mood than the other.

and won’t the city you’re founding be a hellenic city?

it def should be, he replied.

then the citizens are gonna be mad civilized, right?

yeah, super civilized.

and won’t they be full‑on hellas lovers, considering hellas as their crib and sharing the common temples?

most definitely.

and any beef that pops off among them will just be seen as discord – like a squabble between besties, not a legit war?

def not.

so they’ll squabble like they’re planning a future makeup sesh?

for sure.

they’ll keep it to friendly corrections without turning foes into slaves or wrecking their rivals; they’re like menders, not mortal enemies.

exactly.

and since they're all hellenes, they won’t wreck hellas, torch cribs, or assume that every single person in a city – dudes, dudettes, and kiddos – is automatically an enemy. they get that the guilt of war only sticks to a few, while the many are pure homies. so they won’t waste their lands or raze their houses; their beef lasts only until the many innocent peeps force the guilty few to cough up some reparation.

i’m with that, he said – our citizens should handle their hellenic foes just like that, and face barbarians the same way hellenes settle among themselves.

so let’s make it law for our guardians too: they ain’t allowed to wreck hellenic lands or torch their cribs.

agreed; and we can be like “facts, these are as lit as all our previous laws.”

but still, socrates, i gotta say that if you keep vibing like this, you’ll totally forget the big question you dropped at the start: is such an order even possible, and if so, how? i’m more than ready to admit that your plan – if it’s even doable – would do mad good for the state. plus, let’s not forget that your citizens would be the bravest warriors ever, never ditching their ranks ‘cause they all know each other so tight that each one calls the other father, brother, son; and if you throw the ladies into the mix – whether in the frontline or in backup, either to terrorize the enemy or as extra help when needed – they’d be absolutely invincible; and there are a ton of homegrown perks i fully ack, but if your state drops, we don’t even need to spill more tea on that. so, assuming your state is a real deal, let’s now get into the nitty‑gritty of possibility and ways and means – the rest can chill.

if i even chill for a sec, you immediately launch a full‑on raid on me, i said, showing zero mercy; i barely dodged the first and second waves, and now you’re dropping the third – which is the heaviest and most savage yet. when you catch the third wave, i bet you'll be like, “okay, maybe there’s some legit fear and hesitation, since this proposal is straight‑up extra.”

the more of these wild appeals you drop, he said, the more we’re locked in on getting you to spill how such a state can even exist – so speak up, now.

let me kick it off by reminding you that we got here while on the hunt for what’s just and unjust.

true, he replied; but so what?

i was just gonna ask: now that we’ve peeped the ideals, do we expect the just dude to be 100% flawless in absolute justice, or is it cool if he just levels up in justice more than the average joe?

approximation’s aight.

we were lowkey exploring the nature of absolute justice and the vibe of the perfectly just, and digging into injustice and the perfectly unjust, so we could have that ideal flex. we checked them out to see if our own happiness stacks up to that benchmark, not to prove they actually exist, but just as our ultimate vibe.

facts, he said.

would a painter be any less dope if, after crafting a sick ideal of a drop‑dead gorgeous dude, he couldn’t prove that such a guy ever existed?

nah, he’d still be fire.

and weren’t we just crafting our ideal perfect state?

for sure.

and is our theory any less lit just ’cause we can’t prove a city can actually be set up like that?

surely not, he replied.

that legit is facts, i said. but if, as you requested, i'm gonna try and flex on how and under what conditions the chance is off the charts, i gotta ask you—keeping all this in mind—to drop your old receipts.

what receipts?

i wanna know: do ideals ever hit 100% in our language? like, does a word not try to spill way more tea than just the bare fact, and doesn’t the real deal—whatever a dude thinks—even always fall a bit short of the truth? what’s your take?

i stan.

then you can’t make a mad flex that the actual state’s gonna match the ideal in every single drip: if we can only peep how a city might run almost as tight as we envisioned, you’ll have to vibe that we’ve shown the possibility you’re demanding—and be cool with that. i’m 100% sure i’d be chill—right?

yes, i will.

let me now drop some next-level wisdom on what’s wrong with states that got them stuck in sus admin mode, and what’s the tiniest tweak that can level up a state into a truer vibe; and let that tweak, if possible, be just one thing only, or if not, maybe two—basically, keep the changes super minimal.

certainly, he replied.

i think, i said, that a state could be reformed with just one single change. it ain’t exactly an easy flex, but it’s def within the realm of possibility.

"what is it?" he said.

now then, i said, i'm about to go face what i call the ultimate wave—yet my word will drop regardless, even if that wave yeets me into a fit of laughter and total dishonor; so bookmark my words.

proceed.

i said: "until philosophers are kings, or until the kings and princes of this world get that philosophy drip—when political epicness and wisdom squad up as one, and all those basic peeps who chase one vibe to the exclusion of the other get benched—cities will never catch a break from their crunk evils, nor will humanity (in my humble opinion), and only then can our state even hope to glow up and catch some real light." that was the vibe i wanted to drop, my dear glaucon—a vibe i would’ve unleashed if it hadn’t felt way too extra; because to be convinced that no other state can ever serve happiness, whether on the low-key or in the spotlight, is a tall order.

"socrates, what are you even saying?" you gotta peep that the word you just dropped is one that a ton of folks—not to mention hella respectable ones—will literally rip off their coats in a hot minute and snatch up any weapon lying around, coming at you full send before you even know what hit you; and if you don’t come back with a savage clapback and get movin’, you’ll be “pared by their fine wits,” no cap.

you got me into this mess, i said.

and i was dead-on; but i'll do all i can to pull you out of that hot mess. i can only hand you the best vibes and solid advice—and maybe, just maybe, drop answers to your questions better than anyone else. that’s all. and now, with that wingman vibe, you gotta show all the haters that you’re absolutely right.

i should give it a go, i said, since you’re handing me some truly invaluable assists. and i think if we’re gonna bust out of this one alive, we gotta break down exactly who we mean when we say that philosophers are gonna run the state; only then can we hold our ground. there’ll be peeps meant to dive deep into philosophy and lead the state, and others who weren’t born to be deep thinkers—who are meant to ride as followers rather than be on that leader grind.

"now, hit me with a definition," he said.

follow me, i said, and i hope that i can slide you a satisfactory breakdown.

proceed.

i bet you remember—so i won’t be extra boring—that a true lover (if he even deserves that tag) should flex his love not just for one little bit of what he’s into, but for the whole epic package.

i’m, like, seriously confused here, so help refill my memory.

someone else, i said, might drop the same lines you just did; but a dude who’s all about good times like you oughta know that all the young, fresh-outta-the-oven peeps somehow light a spark in a lover’s chest and are deemed worthy of his mad affection. isn’t that just how you roll with the cuties: one might rock a snub nose and you hype his charming mug; another’s hook-nosed gets called regal; while a dude with neither snag gets props for being solidly regular—dark visages are manly, the fair are basically children of the gods; and as for those dubbed “honey pale,” what’s in a name but a lover’s playful flex? in a word, there’s absolutely no excuse or twist you won’t drop just to keep every blooming flower of youth in your squad.

if you crown me as the ultimate authority on love matters—just for debate’s sake, i’m down.

and what about wine lovers? don’t you see them acting the same? they’re always hyped for any excuse to get lit on wine.

lit.

and same goes for ambitious peeps; if they can’t boss an army, they’re cool with leading a small squad; and if they can’t score respect from the top-tier, they’ll be stoked to get props from the underdogs—but they gotta have some type of honor, nonetheless.

exactly.

once more, let me ask: does a dude who craves any kind of goods really want the whole collection, or just a snippet?

the whole collection, obviously.

and can we call a philosopher a lover who’s into not just a slice of wisdom, but the entire wisdom buffet?

yes, the whole shebang.

and what about someone who disses learning—especially as a young buck who’s not yet got the chill to tell what’s good and what’s not? such a dude, we’d say, ain’t a philosopher or a true knowledge bae—just like someone who skips their grub isn’t really hungry, and can be seen as having a weak appetite instead of a solid one.

deadass true, he said.

but what about a dude who’s down for every drop of knowledge, always curious, never satisfied—can we call that beast a philosopher? am i right?

glaucon said: if being curious makes you a philosopher, then a whole lotta weirdos will sport that tag. every single one of those who are all about pretty sights gets a kick from learning, so they all gotta be in the mix. even music fanboys are hella out of place among philosophers—they’re the last ones on earth to jump into a deep convo, especially when they’re busy vibing hard at the dionysiac festivals like they just dropped their headphones; whether the rager’s in the city or the sticks makes zero diff—they’re there. so, are we really supposed to say that all these peeps—and all who have similar tastes, plus even the low-key art professors—are legit philosophers?

certainly not, i replied; they’re just playin’ at it.

he said: then who are the true, certified philosophers?

those, i said, who are absolutely all about that vision of truth.

that’s mad fire, he said; but i wanna know—what exactly are you vibing on?

to be honest, i replied, it might be tough to break down fully for someone else; but i’m sure you’ll buy into the proposition i’m about to drop.

what’s the proposition?

that since beauty is the straight-up opposite of ugliness, they’re like two sides of the same coin?

definitely.

and since they roll in pairs, each one is like a single epic drop?

true again.

and the same applies to just vs. unjust, good vs. evil, and every other pairing: taken solo, each is a singular vibe; but once they mix with actions, with things, and with each other, they flash up in all sorts of wild ways?

very true.

and that’s exactly the diff i’m drawing between the squad that’s all in for sights, art, and practical living and the ones i’m chatting about—only these real ones deserve the philosopher title.

"how do you even split them up?" he said.

the peeps who are all about vibing on sounds and sights, i replied, are, in my opinion, hooked on fine tones, colors, shapes, and every flashy product made of them—but their minds just can’t level up to see or feel pure, absolute beauty.

true, he replied.

only a few manage to catch that full-on drip.

very true.

and what about a dude who can peep beautiful vibes in regular stuff but can’t catch that absolute beauty— or if someone tries to school him on the real beauty vibe, he just can’t keep up—is that guy awake, or is he still lost in a wild dream? think on it: isn’t a dreamer, whether sleeping or half-awake, the one who starts mixing up totally different things, swapping a lame copy for the real deal?

i’d totally say that dude is straight-up snoozing.

but flip it: consider the guy who knows straight-up that absolute beauty exists, who can tell the idea apart from all the basic copies that try to ride its coattails—who never swaps the idea for a random object or vice versa—is he still dreaming, or is he wide awake?

he’s wide awake, bro.

and can we say that the mind of the one who really gets it has genuine knowledge, while the mind of the one who’s just tossing out opinions only has, well, opinion?

certainly.

but suppose the opinion-only dude starts clashing with us over our facts—can we drop some smooth, calming advice on him without making it obvious that his brain’s kinda glitched out?

we absolutely gotta serve him some top-tier advice, he replied.

come on, then, let’s brainstorm what to say. should we kick it off by saying he’s welcome to any knowledge he’s got and that we’re stoked he holds it? but then we gotta ask him a big question: does a dude with knowledge actually know something, or does he know nothing? (you gotta answer for him.)

i’m sayin’ he knows something.

something that is, or something that ain’t?

something that is; ‘cause how could somethin’ that ain’t ever be known?

and are we 100% sure—after peepin’ it from a bajillion angles—that absolute being is or can be known for real, while the total non-existent is as unknown as, like, a lost meme?

nothing’s more solid, no cap.

good. but if there's something that kinda exists and kinda doesn’t, and sits in that chill zone between pure being and complete nothingness?

yeah, right in between.

and since knowledge is all about being, and ignorance is basically the flip side (not-being), then for that in-between zone there’s gotta be a matching in-between between total ignorance and head-on knowledge, right?

certainly.

do we even admit that opinion exists?

undoubtedly.

is opinion just a carbon copy of knowledge, or is it another power in its own right?

definitely another faculty, no cap.

so, opinion and knowledge vibe with totally different kinds of content ‘cause they come from different mental flexes?

yes.

and knowledge’s got its game tied to being—it’s all about knowing being. but before i dive deeper, imma break things down a bit.

what split?

i’m gonna set faculties apart in their own squad: they’re the inherent powers in us (and in all things) that make us do what we do. like, sight and hearing—i’d call those faculties. did i drop a clear squad breakdown?

yes, i get it.

then here’s my take on them: i don’t literally “see” these powers; so the diff in shapes, colors, and all that jazz, which lets me spot differences in some stuff, doesn’t even apply. when i talk about a faculty, i’m only thinking about its turf and its endgame; and if two things share the same turf and output, i call ‘em the same faculty—but if they hit different zones or results, then they’re on diff teams. that sound right?

yup.

and can you do me one more solid? would you say knowledge is a faculty, or what squad does it even belong to?

definitely, knowledge is a faculty, and honestly, it’s the mightiest one out there.

and what about opinion—does that count as a faculty too?

definitely, he said; ‘cause opinion is the tool we use to form opinions.

but didn’t you just admit a minute ago that knowledge isn’t the same as opinion?

true, he said: how could any logical being ever mix up the infallible with the error-prone?

solid answer, i said, proving we’re well aware of the diff.

yes.

so if knowledge and opinion have their own distinct powers, they must have different turf or subject-matters too, right?

that's a given.

being is the turf of knowledge, and knowledge is all about knowing what being is, correct?

yes.

and opinion is just about having a hot take?

yes.

and do we even know what we’re opining about? or does the subject-matter of opinion match that of knowledge?

nah, he replied, that’s been debunked already; if a diff in mental flex means diff turf, and since, as we said, opinion and knowledge are separate faculties, then their subject zones can’t be the same.

so if being is the subject of knowledge, then opinion’s subject gotta be something else?

yes, something else.

well then, isn’t it that not-being is the subject of opinion? or, like, how can there even be an opinion about not-being? think: when a dude’s dropping an opinion, isn’t he always talking about something? can he just have an opinion about straight-up nothing?

impossible.

if you got an opinion, it’s always on something, right?

yes.

and not-being isn’t just one thing, it’s literally nothing, basically?

true.

for not-being, we assume ignorance is its built-in sidekick; for being, it’s knowledge.

true, he said.

so then opinion isn’t really about either being or not-being?

not about either.

and can it therefore be neither pure ignorance nor full-on knowledge?

that seems to be the case.

but is opinion meant to be chased as something beyond both—somewhere brighter than pure ignorance but not as lit as full knowledge—or the opposite?

neither.

i guess that means opinion comes off darker than knowledge yet lighter than pure ignorance?

both—that’s exactly it, and to a pretty solid degree.

and it’s like, nested right between and inside both?

yes.

then you'd say opinion is totally that in-between, intermediate state?

no question.

but didn’t we say earlier that if something seems to be both “on” and “off” at the same time, it’s naturally stuck in the zone between pure being and absolute non-being—and that the corresponding mental flex is neither full-on knowledge nor total ignorance, but rather smack in the middle?

true.

and in that smack-in-the-middle zone, we discovered something we call opinion?

yep.

so what’s left to uncover is the object that flexes both being and not-being equally—and can’t really be tagged as either, plain and simple; this mystery term, when we finally decode it, we can call the subject of opinion, and assign each thing to its proper faculty—the extremes to the extreme faculties and the average to the mid-grade faculty.

true.

with all that set, i wanna ask the opinion-homie—who claims there’s no fixed, unchangeable concept of beauty (for him, the beautiful is just a hot-mess mashup)—i’m talkin’ to you, the lover of dope sights, who just can’t handle being told that beautiful is one, or that just is one, or that anything is one: would you kindly, sir, break it down for us and tell if among all these bomb beauties there’s one that never turns ugly; or among all that’s just, is there one that never drips off as unjust; or among the sacred, is there one that isn’t also, like, unholy?

"nah," he replied; "the beautiful will, from some angle, come off as ugly; and honestly, same goes for the rest."

and can’t the many things that are doubles sometimes be seen as halves too? like, doubles of one vibe and halves of another?

straight up true.

and labels like great and small, heavy and light—do these labels even lock down these things any more than their opposites do?

true; both these labels and their opposites always stick with them.

and can any one of those many things, which we call by their own special names, be pinned down as strictly one thing rather than not that thing?

he replied: they're like those pun-filled riddles you hear at feasts or the kids’ puzzle about the eunuch tryna hit a bat—with what he smacked it, as the riddle goes, and what the bat was chillin’ on. the individual objects i'm droppin’ are riddles too, with double meanings: you can’t lock ’em in your brain as simply being or not-being, or both, or neither.

then what are you gonna do with these? i asked. can they even have a spot that’s better than being stuck between being and non-being? because, clearly, they’re not in deeper darkness or total negation than non-being, nor are they more aglow with existence than being.

that’s totally true, he said.

so it seems we’ve peeped that the numerous ideas the crowd’s tossing around about the beautiful, and about literally everything else, are just swirling in that zone that’s halfway between pure being and pure non-being?

we have.

yes; and earlier, we agreed that anything like this is to be labeled as matter of opinion—not matter of solid knowledge; it’s that intermediate flow caught by the mid-grade faculty.

deadass true.

then those who peep a bunch of beautiful things, yet can’t catch absolute beauty—or can’t follow any guide that shows the way to it; who see many “just” moments instead of pure justice, and the like—these folks, we say, only have opinions and not real knowledge.

that's for sure.

but those who can see the absolute, eternal, and unchangeable? they can be said to actually know, not just be throwing around opinions, right?

no doubt on that.

the ones who vibe hard and embrace the subjects of true knowledge, versus those who only dish out opinions—aren’t the latter basically the same peeps who jam to sweet tunes and check out pretty colors, but would never stomach the idea of absolute beauty?

yes, i remember that.

so, are we off-base calling these folks “lovers of opinion” instead of “lovers of wisdom,” and will they flip out on us for droppin’ that label?

i’ll tell ‘em not to catch heat; no dude should get mad at what’s 100% true.

but those who are into truth in every single thing should be tagged as lovers of wisdom—not just opinion.

assuredly.

book vi.

and so, glaucon, after this marathon debate rolled on for what felt like forever, the real ones—and the fakes—of philosophy have finally dropped into the feed.

i don’t think, he said, that we could’ve cut this convo any shorter.

i guess not, i said; but i still feel we could've scoped out both crews better if we’d just stuck to this one topic and not been sidetracked by a gazillion other questions. anyone tryna figure out how the life of the just vibes differently from that of the unjust has got a lot more to consider.

"and what’s the next question?" he asked.

surely, i said, it’s the one that follows in line. since only philosophers can really vibe with the eternal and unchangeable, and anyone roaming in the messy, variable zone ain’t a philosopher—i gotta ask: which of these two crews should be ruling our state?

and how can we even answer that deets?

whichever crew is best suited to guard our state’s laws and setups—let them be our ultimate guardians.

bet.

and i mean, can there even be any doubt that a guardian charged with keepin’ things in order should have legit eyes instead of just stumbling blind?

no question about it.

and aren’t those folks who are seriously lacking in true knowledge about the real nature of every single thing—who got zero clear pattern in their core, and who, like a painter with busted vision, can’t peep the absolute truth or trace it back to that original vibe to set up laws about beauty, goodness, and justice in this world (if they aren’t already set up), and who can’t even keep that order locked down—aren’t those peeps just, like, straight-up blind?

truly, he replied, they’re mad blind in that condition.

and will they be our gatekeepers when there’s others who, besides being on fleek in experience and never falling short on any virtue drip, also know the real tea on every single thing, no cap?

there’s zero reason, he said, to ghost those rocking the ultimate flex of qualities—they gotta always be frontliners unless they totally flop in another vibe.

so then, i was like, what if we figure out just how far they can mash these next-level excellences together?

bet.

first off, like, as we peeped from the jump, we gotta get the 411 on what a philosopher’s vibe really is. we need to vibe-check him, and once we’re on the same page, then—if i’m not trippin’—we’re gonna admit that this epic squad synergy is totally possible, and only those who flex that whole plug combo should be the big bosses of the state.

what u mean?

imagine if philosophical minds are always down to soak up that kind of knowledge which spills the eternal tea—that truth that never gets sus from generation to generation.

facts.

and then i was like, also, let’s be real: they stan all that is 100% real; there’s no piece of existence—big or small, extra or low-key—they’d hustle to keep, just like we said about the lovebirds and the go-getters.

deadass.

and if they’re gonna be exactly what we just dropped, isn’t there another drip they gotta have?

what quality?

truthfulness: they won’t ever let fake news crash their brain—they straight up despise lies and are all heart for the real tea.

facts, that totally checks out.

“maybe,” my dude, i replied, ain’t the move—you gotta say “must be affirmed:” cuz anyone who’s got that love vibe in their core can’t help but stan anything tight with the object of his crush.

right on, he said.

and is there anything closer to wisdom than the real tea?

how would there even be?

can someone flex as both a wisdom stan and a fake news fanboy?

nah, never.

so the true learning stan must, from day one, if he can, chase every truth, right?

100%.

but real talk: we all know that if someone’s hella hungry for one vibe, then their other cravings are gonna be low-key slack—they’re like a stream getting rerouted into another channel, ya feel?

facts.

someone who’s all about chasing every kind of knowledge is gonna be so deep in soul vibes that physical pleasures become meh—assuming he’s a legit philosopher and not a total poser.

no doubt, fr.

that type is guaranteed to be chill af and the total opposite of greedy; cuz the vibes that make most peeps chase clout and cash just ain’t in his playlist.

big facts.

another ticker for the philosopher vibe gotta be looked at too.

what’s that, tho?

there shouldn’t be any hidden cringe of closed-minded vibes; nothing’s more sus than throwing shade or being petty to a soul always thirstin’ for the full deets of everything divine and human.

preach, he said.

so how can someone with a mega lit mind, who’s out here peeping all the vibes of time and existence, even give two shits about just human life?

nah, fam.

or will that kind of brain be shook by death and its vibes?

nope, not at all.

so a cowardly, basic vibe ain’t invited to the real philosophy party, right?

surely not.

or like, can someone who’s got that perfectly balanced drip—who’s not jealously basic, petty, flexin’, or scared—ever end up being shady or extra brutal in his dealings?

not even close.

so you’ll peep real quick if someone is all fair and chill or straight-up rude and extra AF; these are the obvious signs, even from a young age, that separate philosophy OGs from total noobs.

facts.

another tea drop that needs to be spilled.

what’s the tea?

whether he’s vibin’ with learning or not; ‘cause no one’s gonna stan something that straight up hurts and leaves them grindin’ with barely any level ups.

definitely not.

and again, if he’s stuck on forgetful mode and can’t lock down what he learns, isn’t he just a ghost vessel?

totally.

if he puts in all that work for nada, he’s gonna end up hatin’ himself and his flop hustle, right? yes.

so a soul that’s all forgetful isn’t in the true philosopher squad; we gotta insist a legit philosopher’s got savage memory skills, right?

fact.

and again, a vibe that’s off-key and not on fleek can only get extra unbalanced, right?

for sure.

so, u think truth is more like a perfect balance rather than total chaos?

balance, 100%.

then along with all these sick traits, we gotta scout for a mind that’s naturally balanced and mad graceful—the kind that automatically vibes with the real essence of everything, no cap.

fact.

and like, don’t all these vibes together form the ultimate must-have for a soul to fully live its best existence?

they’re a must, he replied.

and shouldn’t that be a lit journey that only those blessed with epic memory and quick wit—noble, chill, ride-or-die for truth, justice, courage, temperance, all squad goals—can even try?

even the jealousy god himself, he said, wouldn’t throw shade at such a pursuit.

and i said, for peeps like that, once they glow up with years and schooling, only them should be trusted to run the state.

here adeimantus jumped in and was like: "socrates, no one can even clap back at these statements; but when u drop lines like these, your listeners get hit with some wild feels—they start thinking they’re getting played at every step because they ain’t pro at tossing questions and answers. these little missteps stack up, and by the end, they feel like they’ve been totally yeeted, with all their old ideas flipped upside down. it’s like watching noob checkers players get boxed in by pros with zero moves left—ending up with nada to say in this word game, even though they were technically right all along. i’m just spitting facts based on what’s poppin’ right now. because anyone could say, even if they can’t nail every word, we all know for real that the philosophy squad—whether as young rookies in school or full-time deep thinkers in their prime—most of them turn into weird monsters, even total rogues, and the so-called best end up getting wrecked by the very hustle you be hyping." 

obviously, he said.

so, u think those haters are totally off-base?

i can’t really say, he replied; but i’m lowkey curious—what’s your take?

check my answer: i think they’re 100% right.

then how u gonna justify saying that cities won’t stop being sus until philosophers run the show, when we all agree that philosophers are totally useless to city life?

u hit me with a question, i said, and the only answer is a lit parable.

yeah, socrates; and i bet that’s not your usual vibe, right?

i can tell, i said, that u’re lowkey cracking up at me for diving us into such a hopeless convo; but just chill and hear this parable, and then u’ll be even more LOL at how basic my imagination is: ‘cause the way the top-tier dudes get treated in their own cities is hella savage—there’s nothing on earth that compares; so if i gotta rep their vibe, i gotta go full fiction mode and whip up a figure made of wild mashups, like those legendary goat-stag unions you see in spicy pics.

picture this: a fleet or ship with a captain who’s majorly tall and strong compared to the crew, but lowkey he’s a bit hard of hearing and his eyesight is kinda sus, plus his navigation game is pretty weak.

the sailors are beefing over who’s gonna steer—everyone’s like “i got dibs” even though none of them ever got schooled in nav skills, can’t even name who dropped the knowledge or when, and they’re throwing mad shade that navigation can’t be taught—ready to yeet anyone who disagrees.

they swarm around the captain, literally begging and pleading to snag the helm; and if they don’t get their way and someone else gets chosen, they straight up off that person by killing or tossing them overboard—and after jamming the captain’s senses with booze or some wild drug, they pull a full-on mutiny, seize the ship, and go ham with the loot; then, eating and drinking, they cruise on their voyage just as degens do.

anyone who’s down with their squad and smart-ass helps them yank the ship from the captain’s grip—whether by brute force or smooth talk—gets mad props as sailor, pilot, able seaman; meanwhile, they diss any other dude by calling him a total waste-of-space; but real talk: a legit pilot’s gotta be all about tracking the calendar, seasons, sky, stars, winds, and every detail of his craft if he’s gonna be a true ship commander—and he must steer, no matter if peeps are down or not. the idea of merging boss authority with real steering skills never even popped off in their clique’s brain.

so in ships taken over by a mutiny, run by rebellious sailors, how’s the real pilot gonna be seen? won’t they roast him as a chatterbox, a star-gazer, a total useless scrub?

obviously, said adeimantus.

then you won’t even need, i said, an extra breakdown of this parable that vibes the true philosopher’s role in the state; cuz u already get it.

facts.

so, now imagine dropping this parable on some dude who’s shook that philosophers get zero props in their cities; break it down for him and try to flex that them getting mad honor would be even more extra.

i gotchu.

tell him this: when he calls the top philosophy fans useless to the rest of the world, he’s kinda right; but also let him know it’s on the people who won’t use them that’s the real weak link—not the philosophers. like, the pilot isn’t supposed to be out here begging the sailors to let him steer—that ain’t how nature vibes; and the idea that “the wise should knock on the rich’s doors” is straight-up fake news. the truth is, when you’re sick—rich or broke—you gotta hit up a doctor, and if you wanna be ruled, you go to someone who can actually rule. a ruler who’s any good shouldn’t be begging his squad to let him boss them around; even though today’s govs are on a whole other cringe level—they’re just like those mutinous sailors, while the real helmsmen are the ones they roast as useless star-gazers.

exactly so, he said.

so, for these reasons, among peeps like these, philosophy—the ultimate pursuit—isn’t gonna be hyped by the opposers; not that its haters do any more damage than the self-professed philosophy fans, who, as the accuser would say, are mostly total rogues with even the so-called best being useless—and i was like, totally agree.

facts.

and the reason why the good end up useless is now laid out, right?

deadass.

so, now should we slide into showing that the majority’s being hella rotten is unavoidable and that it’s not fair to blame philosophy any more than anything else?

bet.

and let’s do a q&a sesh, starting with the gentle, noble vibe. truth, as u remember, was his main squad leader—always in the mix for everything; if he flopped on that, he was just a poser who didn’t belong in true philosophy.

facts, that's what was said.

so, isn’t this one trait, among others, totally at odds with how folks see him nowadays?

for sure, he said.

and can we not stan in his defense that a real knowledge stan is always hustlin’ to be—that’s just his nature; he won’t chill in a crowd of superficial peeps, but will keep grinding—the sharp edge never dulled and his fire never fizzled until he snagged the deets on the true nature of every essence, powered by a soul squad that totally clicks, drawing near, mixing up, and merging with true being—birthing pure mind and truth—then he’ll level up and live for real, and only then will he finally chill from his grind.

nothing, he said, could be more on point than that description.

and will a philosopher ever vibe with lies at all? won’t he straight up hate fake news?

he sure will.

and when truth’s the captain, there’s no way the crew he rolls with is shady, right?

impossible, fam.

plus, justice and chill vibes will tag along, with temperance trailing right behind?

true that, he replied.

also, there’s zero point in me re-dropping the philosopher’s virtues—courage, magnificence, smarts, memory, all that came naturally to him. and u did throw shade that, even though no one could deny my drops back then, when you peep the facts, some peeps described that way are obviously useless and most are just straight-up depraved; so we had to dive into why the majority are bad, which naturally circled us back to breaking down what a true philosopher really is.

exactly.

and next, we gotta talk about the corrupt vibes in philosophy—why so many get totally wrecked while only a few keep it 100% pure. i’m talking about those labeled useless but not outright evil—and then, after that, we’ll drop on the philosophy imposters: what kind of peeps chase a vibe that’s way out of their league, living unworthy, and with all their cray inconsistencies, drag philosophy and all its homies into that universal shade we keep dishing.

what are these corruptions, tho? he asked.

let me spill the tea: everyone can agree that a nature packed with all the dope qualities we require in a philosopher is a rare plant—like, a legendary, one-of-a-kind specimen that almost never shows up among humans.

super rare, fr.

and oh my god, countless savage forces are out here straight tryna wreck these rare vibes!

what kinda causes, tho?

first off, they got their own epic virtues—courage, temperance, etc.—and every one of these dope traits (and yo, it’s wild) can actually wreck and sidetrack a soul from hardcore philosophy.

that’s hella weird, he replied.

then there’s all the usual life perks—beauty, money, muscle, status, and major state clout—you know the drill—these too can totally corrupt and distract.

i feel that; but i gotta know more precisely what u mean about those.

grasp the tea as a whole, i said, in the right vibe; then u won’t trip trying to decode my earlier drops, and they won’t seem weird to u anymore.

and how am i supposed to do that? he asked.

well, i said, think of it like this: all seeds or tiny life germs—be it plant or animal—when they don’t get the proper nourishment, climate, or soil for their level of litness, become even more sensitive to missing that vibe, ‘cause bad juju is a way bigger enemy to something that’s good than to stuff that’s just meh.

facts.

and it makes sense that the dopest vibes, when planted in totally foreign soil, get wrecked even harder than the basic ones—‘cause the contrast is mad intense.

word.

and can we say, adeimantus, that the most extra gifted minds, when ruined by bad schooling, end up being crazy toxic? like, don’t the worst crimes and pure evil vibes spring from full-on nature trashed by education rather than from being low-key basic, while the weak ones barely pull off any epic good or epic evil?

i totally think you're right there.

and our philosopher follows the same vibe—like a plant that, when nurtured right, is destined to bloom into pure virtue; but if planted in trashy soil, he turns into the nastiest weed ever, unless some divine force keeps him in check. do u really think, as ppl always say, that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private tutors mess 'em up in any major way? aren’t the folks spouting that stuff the ultimate sophists? they totally school everyone—young, old, men, and women—and shape them after their own vibe.

when does that even go down? he said.

when they all link up, and the whole squad chills at an assembly—be it in a court, a theatre, a camp, or any poppin’ spot—and there’s a wild uproar, with peeps hyping some things and dissing others, blowing everything way out of proportion, with yelling and clapping that bounces off the rocks and the whole place doubling the noise—won’t a young man’s heart, as they say, get a major jump? can any private schooling help him stand firm against the tidal wave of squad opinion, or will he just ride the wave? won’t he end up thinking just like the masses—doing what they do, being what they are?

yes, socrates; necessity’s gonna force him, no cap.

and yet, i said, there’s an even bigger deal that hasn’t been dropped yet.

what’s that, tho?

it’s the low-key force of being totally canceled, confiscated, or even facing death—which, as u know, these new sophists and educators (the public, basically) throw down when their words lose power.

yup, they do; and for real, no cap.

so, what opinion of any other sophist or random peep can even compete in such a lopsided showdown?

none at all, he replied.

nah, i said, even trying is a crazy fool move; there’s never been, isn’t now, and won’t ever be any kind of character who hasn’t gotten their virtue drip solely from public opinion—i’m talking human virtue only; anything beyond that, as the old saying goes, doesn’t count: i don’t want u to be in the dark that in this messed-up state of governments, whatever gets saved and turns good is straight up saved by god’s power, real talk.

i totally agree, he replied.

so lemme get u to vibe with one more observation.

what’s u gonna drop?

why, so all these mercenary peeps that the squad calls sophists—and basically labels as their haters—are lowkey only teaching the mainstream opinions, the vibes of the crew; and that, my dudes, is their so-called wisdom. i’d compare them to a bro who studies the moods and cravings of a savage beast he feeds—learning how to vibe with that beast, figuring out when it’s lit or when it’s sus, what all its cries even mean, and which sounds chill it out or flip it into rage; and yo, imagine that when he’s been grinding on these beast-mode lessons long enough, he straight up calls his clout “wisdom” and turns it into a system or art form he then flexes, even though he’s hella clueless about what he’s really saying when he chats about these vibes or passions—labeling stuff as honorable or cringey, good or evil, just or bogus, all based on the mood of that mega brute. like, he’s all “good” if it’s what makes the beast hype and “evil” if it’s not; and he can only explain it by saying the legit and noble are just the must-haves—despite never actually peeping the deep diff between them. for real, wouldn’t such a dude be a rare educator?  
 
for sure, bet.  

so, how is the dude who thinks wisdom is just about reading the vibes of the random mob—whether in art, beats, or politics—any different from the one i just roasted? cuz when a guy hangs with the masses and flexes his poem, art, or state service, letting them be his judges even when he ain’t forced to, the so-called necessity of diomede got him droppin’ whatever gets mad praise. yet the excuses they drop to back up their own ideas of what’s “honor roll worthy” and “good” are literally clown-level. have you ever peeped any that weren’t straight-up bogus? nah, and i seriously doubt we ever will.  

you feelin’ the truth of my tea? then peep this: will the world ever get on board with the idea of absolute beauty instead of just a whole buffet of “meh, pretty” stuff, or the idea of one dope, one-of-a-kind vibe instead of a remix of basics? def not.  

so, the world ain’t ever gonna be philosophical? impossi-bro.  

and that means philosophers are always gonna catch clout and flak from the masses, right? they gotta.  

what about those peeps who squad up with the mob just to score likes? obviously, fr.  

so, can a true philosopher stick to his vibe till the end? remember, we were all like, he’s gotta have mad speed, memory, guts, and that major flex—those are the real philosopher’s gifts. facts.  

so, wouldn’t a dude like that, even from day one, be first in everything—especially if his bod is as fire as his brain? straight up, bet.  

and his crew and fellow citizens will totally ride his wave as he levels up, right? no cap. they’ll be all down at his feet, sliding in with favs and flattery, tryna scoop that power he’s gonna rock someday. and that literally happens all the time.  

so, what’s a dude like him gonna do when he’s in a big, bougie city—loaded, noble, and that tall, proper youth vibe? won’t he be dripping with epic dreams, thinking he can boss around both hellenes and barbarians, letting that hype inflate him with extra vain pomp and cringe pride? for sure, bet.  

but when he’s riding that ego-high, if some chill homie slides up and gently goes, “yo, you’re a fool, and you gotta grind for real understanding,” do you think he’ll just chill and listen? nah fam, he ain’t tryna.  

and even if a genuinely chill dude has his eyes popped a bit and gets humbled by philosophy, how his ride-or-die crew gonna act if they figure out they’re about to lose that clout from his company? they’ll straight-up do and say anything to block him from leveling up to his better self, even throwing shady plots and public drama to make his mentor look weak. no doubt, fr.  

so, how can a dude caught in that mess ever glow up into a true philosopher? impossi-bro.  

so, weren’t we dead on when we said even the dopest traits that should make someone a philosopher, if he’s mis-educated, can totally sidetrack him from the philosophical grind—just like having mad coins and bling can distract you from the real tea? deadass, correct.  

so, my lit bestie, that's how we end up with all that epic wreckage and failin’ vibes from the peeps who were supposedly built for the top-tier pursuits; these rare vibes come from a squad that births the ones who can either drop the sickest baddies on states and peeps or flip the script to deliver major good when the vibe’s right. lowkey, a small-time dude never pulls off any mega moves for individuals or states. facts, 100% true.  

and so philosophy gets left lonely af, her wedding vibes totally incomplete—her own crew bails and ditches her, and while they’re out here livin’ that bogus life, some trash peeps, seeing she got no ride-or-die homies to back her, roll in and disrespect her, slapping on all the shade like “your followers are total trash and deserve the savage smackdown.” yeah, that’s literally what everyone’s gossipin’.  

yes; and what else could you expect when you peep these tiny, basic creatures who, spotting this land open to them—a land stocked with flashy names and clout titles—dip outta their lame gigs into philosophy like it’s the ultimate flex; those who jump in are probably the savviest wreckers of their own boring trades. even if philosophy’s in a sus state, she still carries a vibe and dignity that the arts just can’t match. and fr, many get drawn to her even if they’re imperfect and their souls are wrecked like their basic hustles—inevitable, right? facts.  

aren't they exactly like a balding little tinker who just bounced outta prison and hit the jackpot; who takes a fresh scrub, rocks a new drip, and shows up all decked like a groom ready to flex marrying his boss’s daughter, leaving the OG broke and bitter? straight fire parallel, no cap.  

so, what’s gonna come out of these clapped-out unions? ain’t they gonna be totally trash and bastardized? obvious, fr.  

and when unqualified peeps try to roll with philosophy—teaming up with someone way above their league—what kind of ideas they gonna spit? won’t it be just fluff sophisms that sound all catchy but are empty and totally lack that genuine sauce of true wisdom? no cap, that's facts.  

then, adeimantus, the real-deal disciples of philosophy are gonna be a tiny elite squad: maybe a noble, well-educated homie stuck in exile, who stays loyal to philosophy 'cause there’s no shady drip around; or a high-key soul born in a sketch city whose politics he straight-up disses; and maybe a few gifted bros who ditch the arts—which they rightfully hate—and jump onto the philosophy train; or perhaps some even get kept in check by our boy theages’ leash, since literally everything in his life tried to steer him off philosophy, but bad health saved him from all that political beef. my own internal sign case? Extra AF, and you rarely, if ever, see another dude with such a next-level monitor.  

those in this elite club have totally tasted how sweet and blessed philosophy is, and they’ve seen so much crazy mass madness; they know straight up that no politician is hella honest, nor is there any justice warrior worth riding with to save the day.  

such a bro is like a dude who falls among savage wild beasts—he won’t join in the shady antics of his crew, but he also can’t, solo, yeet back all their fierce vibes; so, seeing he wouldn’t be flexing any help for the state or his squad, and knowing his life would just be doomed with no gains, he stays lowkey, holds his peace, and rolls solo. he’s like a dude who, in the midst of a dusty, sleety storm whipped by savage winds, finds chill shelter behind a wall; and spotting the world dripping with bad vibes, he’s content just to live his own life, staying pure and free from evil, bouncing out in peace with high hopes.  

yeah, and he’ll have dropped a legendary legacy before he peace-signs out. a mega flex work, yes; but not the ultimate, unless he finds a state that totally vibes with him—because in the perfect state, he’d grow big time and be the savior of his country and himself.  

the tea on why philosophy got such a trash rep has been spilled, and the injustice of the haters is clear—any more tea you wanna drop? nah, nothing more on that track; but i wanna know, which government out there do you think is actually built for philosophy?  

none of 'em, i said; and that's exactly the beef i got with them—not one of these states is worthy of true philosophical vibes, so philosophy ends up warped and alienated; just like an exotic seed dropped in a foreign turf that loses its drip and gets drowned out by the new soil, philosophy’s growth, instead of staying lit, degenerates and morphs into something else.  

but if philosophy ever vibes with a state that's as perfect as she is, then it proves she’s actually divine, and everything else—be it human nature or institutions—is just human AF; and now, i know you’re gonna ask, which state is that?  

nah, he said; you're off track, cuz i was about to throw another question—like, is it the state we built and invented, or some other one?  

yes, i replied, mostly ours; but remember when i dropped that a live authority is always needed in a state—someone rocking that same lit blueprint you had as a legislator when you were laying down the laws.  

true that, he replied.  

yeah, but not in a chill way; you lowkey shook us by throwing up objections, proving that this convo is gonna be super long and hella tough—like, nothing left but the opposite of easy.  

so, what’s left then?  

the big question is how to school philosophy without wrecking the state: every epic flex comes with its risks; as the squad says, “hard is the good.”  

still, he said, once we clear up the deets, the whole inquiry will be set.  

i ain’t gonna be held back by a lack of will, but maybe by a lack of power—check my zeal, fr; and peep this: i boldly declare that states should be chasing philosophy, not like they do now, but with a whole new vibe.  

how so?  

right now, i said, philosophy students are hella young; starting almost straight outta kiddie status, they only use the leftover time from hustlin’ cash and adulting to study philosophy; and even those tagged as super philosophical, when faced with the mad difficulty of stuff—i mean, dialectic—they yeet outta there. later on, when someone else invites them to a lecture, they make a big scene over it, 'cause they don’t really see philosophy as their main hustle; and eventually, when they’re older, most of them totally fizzle out like heraclitus’ sun—never to glow again. (heraclitus dropped that the sun goes out every evening and relights every morning.)  

so what should their game plan be?  

flip the script. in childhood and youth, what and how much they learn should match their chill years: while they’re growing from kid to man, the focus should be on buffin’ up that bod so it can serve philosophy later; as life levels up and the brain matures, let them boost the mental gymnastics; but once our citizens are done with civil and military hustle, let them live freely with zero heavy grind—so they can live their best life now and cap it with epic happiness later.  

yo, socrates, you’re hella serious, fr, he said; i know it; but most of your peeps, i reckon, will be even more deadset on opposing you, and ain’t never gonna get your vibe—thrasymachus especially, no cap.  

yo, chill with beefing between thrasymachus and me, i said, cuz we’re now homies even though we were never haters; i’mma keep grinding until i either convert him and the crew or drop something that boosts them for that next life where we can all vibe together again.  

but you’re talking about a time that’s, like, not even on the horizon.  

nah, i replied, it’s like a timeframe that’s nothing compared to eternity. still, i ain’t shocked the masses don’t believe—cuz they’ve never seen the real deal we’re plotting; they only peep a boring knockoff of philosophy, a jumble of words that’s all manufactured, not like our natural organic vibe.  

but a human who’s perfectly sculpted in word and deed into the ideal of virtue—then ruling a city that straight-up mirrors that drip—have y’all ever even seen that? nah, for real.  

no, my friend, and they’ve barely ever caught those free and noble vibes—like when someone drops real talk, hustlin’ every tool in the book to chase truth and knowledge, while straight-up ignoring petty controversy that’s all about opinions and beef, whether in courts or in the streets.  

they’re total strangers to that real talk, he said.  

and that’s what we predicted, and truth made us admit—with mad hesitation—that no city, state, or individual will ever hit peak perfection until that tiny elite squad of philosophers (whom we once called “useless but not trash”) ends up divinely forced to run the state, whether they like it or not, and until the state is compelled to vibe with them; or until kings, or if not kings, then princes and royal offspring, get mad divinely inspired with a real love for true philosophy.  

whether one or both of those moves are possible, i see lil’ reason to doubt: cuz if that were the case, we’d be roasted as just a bunch of dreamers and visionaries. right?  

deadass.  

so, if in the countless ages past—or even right now in some far-out foreign plug—the ultimate philosopher is, was, or will be forced by a higher power to boss the state, then we’re ready to bet our lives that our constitution has been, is, and will be—yeah, whenever the muse of philosophy reigns. there’s zero impossibility here; we just admit it’s a tough flex.  

my opinion’s on point with yours, he said.  

but are you saying the masses aren’t on the same page?  

i’d imagine not, he replied.  

oo, my friend, i said, don’t come for the masses: they’ll flip their minds if, not all savage-like but gently—aiming to chill them out and erase their hate for over-education—you show them your real philosophers and break down their true vibe like you just did; then peeps will see that the dude you’re talking about is nothing like they thought, and they’ll switch up their take and reply with a whole new strain. who can beef with someone who’s all love—someone so chill and envy-free that there’s no reason for jealousy? nah, lemme break it down: this harsh mood might pop up in a few, but not with most of mankind.  

i totally vibe with you, he said.  

and don’t you also think, like i do, that the mad beef the masses got against philosophy comes from those fake wannabes—those pretenders who roll in uninvited, always trashing philosophy and nitpicking, turning people into the spam of their chat instead of focusing on real substance? nothing is more cringe for a philosopher than that.  

deadass, hella cringe.  

cuz, adeimantus, the dude whose mind is locked on true being, ain’t got time to sweat the petty drama of earth, or be filled with malice and envy, beefing with fools; his eyes stay locked on those fixed, unchanging vibes, where nothing injures or gets injured, but all moves in sweet, orderly reason; these are his blueprint, and he raps his life to that beat as hard as he can. can a dude not mimic that vibe he’s so respectfully chatting about?  

not even remotely possible.  

and a philosopher who vibes with the divine order becomes all orderly and god-tier—as much as a human can—but like everyone else, he’ll catch some shade. obviously.  

and if he’s forced to shape not just himself, but human nature as a whole—whether in states or with individuals—into that same divine template he sees elsewhere, do you think he’d be a clumsy builder of justice, chillness, and every civil virtue? anything but unskilful, my dude.  

and if the world clocks that we’re droppin’ truth bombs about him, will they get triggered at philosophy? will they yeet us when we say that no state can be happy unless it’s designed by artists who flex the heavenly blueprint? they won’t be salty if they get it, he said. but how will they sketch out that master plan you’re vibing about?  

they’ll start by grabbing the state and the vibe of humanity, like wiping off an old tablet to leave a fresh slate. it ain’t easy, fr. but whether it’s a breeze or savage work, that’s the diff between these legends and every other lawmaker—they won’t mess with individuals or the state, and won’t drop any laws until they’ve either discovered or crafted that clean slate.  

yeah, for real, he said.  

once they do that, they’ll sketch out a rough outline of the constitution—no doubt.  

and when they’re filling in the details, i see them peepin’ both up and down: first gazin’ at absolute justice, beauty, and chill vibes, then at the human remix; blending all the elements of life into what becomes the image of a man—and all this done with that other epic vibe which, among peeps, homer calls the form and likeness of god.  

so true, he said.

and one feature they be yeeted out, and another one be slid in, until human ways get remixed to be as lit as god’s vibes, no cap?

indeed, he said, there’s no remix that could drop a fresher pic.

and now, i said, are we finally low-key convincing those mobs you mentioned who charged at us like full send, that the constitution-making artist is exactly the dude we been hyping; the one who got so triggered 'cause we handed the state over to his clutches; and are they chillin’ a bit after our tea drop?

mad chill, if they even got half a brain.

where else could they scoop up any clout to diss us? will they ever doubt that the philosopher is all about truth and realness?

they wouldn’t be that extra.

or that his vibe, as we broke it down, is on the same level as the ultimate flex of good?

no doubt, they can’t even front that.

but then, will they come at us saying that a nature, when placed in the right drip, ain’t gonna be perfectly good and wise if ever? or are they gonna ride with those we already benched?

nah, fr.

then, will they still be salty about our clapback that until philosopher kings run the show, both states and individual peeps will never catch a break from bad vibes, and our dream state remains just a myth?

i think they’ll be way less heated.

so, can we assume they’re not just less salty but actually mellow, and that they’ve been converted—so messed up with shame that they literally can’t front any more?

by all means, he said.

then, let’s say the squad’s been patched up. can anyone throw shade at our point that there are legit royal spawn—like sons of kings or princes—born as straight-up philosophers?

surely not, he said.

and when these homies pop off, is anyone gonna dare claim they’ve gotta be yeeted out for sure; like, we all know they’re hard to save sometimes, but to say that through all the ages not a single one can survive—who’s bold enough to drop that?

who fr, indeed!

but, i said, one lit dude is enough; imagine one king with a city riding his vibe, who can flex and spawn that ideal squad of society that even the world finds incredulous.

yeah, one is enough.

the ruler can drop the laws and structures we been chatting about, and the citizens might just be cool with ‘em?

for real.

and for others to vibe with what we vibe with? that ain’t some next-level miracle or impossible flex?

i think not.

but we already proved, in the tea we dropped earlier, that if all this is even possible, it’s def the best glow-up ever.

facts.

and now we say not only that our lit-ass laws, if enacted, would be the ultimate, but even getting them off the ground—even though it’s a crazy grind—is totally doable.

big mood.

and so, after a ton of pain and hustle, we wrap one chapter, but there’s mad tea left—like, how and through what savage pursuits will these state-saviors be built, and at what ages do they dive into their different quests?

certainly.

i dipped out on that messy drama about having bae’s, making kids, and picking the rulers, 'cause i knew a perfect state would be so extra it’d spark major envy and be super hard to nail down; but that slick dodge didn’t help me 'cause i had to spill the deets anyway. the whole women-and-kids sitch is sorted, but the ruler convo gotta be kicked off from square one. we were saying, as you probs remember, that rulers gotta be mad in love with their country, proven through both the highs and the hella low pain, and that when things get rough, whether in hardships, dangers, or any critical moment, they absolutely must keep that patriotism on fleek—any dude who flops gets ghosted, but the one who stays pure, like gold tested in a savage fire, earns his crown, stacking honors in life and even in the afterlife. that was the vibe, and then the chat dipped and played it coy, not wanting to stir up the very tea that’s now on deck.

i totally remember, he said.

yeah, my friend, i said, and i kinda held back on dropping that next bold truth; but now, brace yourselves—i’m 'bout to confess that the perfect guardian MUST be a straight-up philosopher.

facts, he said—let that be locked in.

and don’t even think there’ll be a whole squad of them; 'cause the essential flexes we deem necessary rarely squad up together—they usually show up in bits and pieces.

what do you mean? he said.

look, i replied, you know that quick smarts, clutch memory, razor wit, and that clever drip don’t often roll together, and that peeps who rock them while being high-spirited and extra generous are usually too wild to live a chill and orderly life; they get driven all over by their impulses, and any real solid vibe just yeets out.

word, he said.

on the flip, those rock-solid, dependable souls—like, unshakable in any brawl and immune to fear—are just as likely to nap when it’s time for brain flex; they’re in a constant chill mode, prone to yawning and catching z’s over any heavy mental grind.

facts.

and yet, as we were saying, both that wild energy and that ultra-stable chill are essential for anyone getting the ultimate edu and stepping into leadership realness.

definitely, he said.

and are these rare gems gonna drop as a class that’s hard to come by?

yes, fr.

then any aspirant must not only get test-run through the savage labors, dangers, and spicy pleasures we mentioned earlier, but there’s another level-up trial we didn’t even flex before—he’s gotta get schooled in mad knowledge vibes to see if his soul can handle the ultimate boss-level knowledge or if it’s gonna straight up crash like any other weak attempt.

i’m with you on that, he said, you’re right on testing the grind. but what exactly do you mean by the absolute highest knowledge?

you remember, i said, that we chopped the soul into three parts and broke down the vibes of justice, chillness (temperance), courage, and wisdom?

true that, he said—if i’d forgotten that, i wouldn’t even deserve the next tea drop.

and do you recall that little heads-up we threw out before diving into those vibes?

what’s that about?

we were saying, if my mental wifi serves right, that anyone tryna peep them in their full, flawless drip must take the long, twisty road, which eventually leads to their full reveal; but we could also throw in a mainstream breakdown on the same level as our earlier chat. and you were like, “yo, that rundown’s cool enough,” so the convo kept rolling in a way that, to me, tossed off some major glitches; whether you’re vibing with it or not is on you.

yeah, he said—I and the squad thought you dropped a solid truth bomb.

but, my dude, i said, handing out only a half-ass measure of truth ain’t fair; nothing imperfect can set the standard, even if peeps are too lazy to search for the whole vibe and think a little is enough.

so true—people being lazy is a whole mood.

yeah, i said—and there’s no worse flex fail in a guardian for the state and its lit laws.

right on.

so the guardian, i said, has gotta be forced to take that longer detour, grinding hard in both learning and gym sessions, or he’ll never hit that supreme knowledge that's his true calling.

what, he said, is there some knowledge even higher than this—above justice and all them other virtues?

yes, i said, there totally is. and about the virtues, we shouldn’t be satisfied with just a rough sketch—they need the full, high-def drop. when even the tiniest deets get slaved over with endless effort so they shine with max clarity, how extra would it be to think the ultimate truths shouldn’t get that same 100% treatment?

a mad noble thought; but do you think we’ll hold back from asking what the ultimate knowledge really is?

nah, i said, ask all you want; but i’m pretty sure you’ve been served this answer on repeat, so either you ain’t vibing with me or, lowkey, you’re just being extra difficult; ‘cause you’ve heard time and again that the idea of good is the peak knowledge, and every other thing gets its clout only by channeling that. you can’t be clueless that i was 'bout to spill that tea—about which, like i've said a million times, we know barely anything; and without it, all other hustle or stash means jack squat. so, do you really think having all the other bits is worth it if we ain’t got the good? or stacking up all that knowledge if we’re missing out on the beauty and goodness vibe?

assuredly not.

and you know most peeps are like, “pleasure is the move” when it comes to good, whereas the real ones say it’s all about knowledge?

yes.

and you also know that the squad vibing with knowledge can’t even explain what they mean without resorting to saying “knowledge of the good” after all.

how absurd is that!

exactly, i said—they gotta start off roasting us for not knowing the good, then act like we’re all gurus of it—as if when they drop the term “good,” we totally get their vibes. that’s so extra.

most true, he said.

and those who hyped pleasure as the good? they’re just as lost; they gotta admit that there’s whack pleasure along with the fire ones.

for sure.

and so, to claim bad and good are, like, one in the same?

true.

there’s literally no way around the crazy maze of issues this question throws up.

no doubt.

furthermore, don’t we peep that a lot of folks are down to do, have, or front as if they’re all just and honorable without actually being the real deal; yet no one’s vibing with a fake glow—everyone’s chasing that real, raw good, because for the good, the fake just ain’t it.

he said, mad true.

so then, for a principle this huge—the ultimate end that every soul chases, even though they got a gut feeling it exists but then hesitate since they’re not fully clued in on its real nature and ain’t as sure about it as with everything else, losing out on all the extra good vibes—how can the best peeps in our state, the ones who hold all the power, be stumbling in the dark of ignorance?

def not, he said.

i’m 100% sure, i said, that anyone who doesn’t get that the beautiful and the just are also straight-up good will end up being a weak-ass guardian; and i seriously suspect that anyone clueless about the good won’t have any real 411 on them, period.

that, he said, is a savage suspicion of yours.

and if we end up with only one guardian who’s got this next-level knowledge, will our state be totally on fleek?

of course, he replied; but now, i gotta ask—do you vibe that this supreme good principle is straight-up knowledge, or pleasure, or something else entirely?

aye, i said, i knew a refined dude like you wouldn’t settle for someone rehashing basic opinions on these heavy deets.

true, socrates; but i gotta say, someone like you who’s clocked a lifetime deep in philosophy shouldn’t just echo the basic takes of others—time to drop your own next-level truth bombs.

but, then, does anyone really have the right to slap down a positive claim on something they don’t even fully know?

nah, he said—without that solid, 100%-on-lock certainty, nobody’s got the right to flex that; they can only throw out their hot takes as opinions.

and don’t you know, i said, that all mere opinions are kinda whack and, like, totally blind? you wouldn’t disagree that those who claim any “true notion” without real smarts are basically like blind peeps stumbling down a sketchy road, right?

very true.

and do you even wanna peep what’s shady, crooked, and basic, when others are here to drop gems about brightness and real beauty?

still, i gotta beg you, socrates, said glaucon, not to dip out just when you’re nearing the finish line; if you can just serve up an explanation of the good like you did with justice, calm, and the rest of the squad, we’ll be totally satisfied.

yes, my friend, i said, and i’d be just as hyped—but lowkey i’m scared of flopping and getting roasted by my own overeager hype. nah, my sweet bros, let’s not push to uncover the full-down nature of the good right now, 'cause reaching the thoughts in my brain is just too extra for me. but if you’re down, i can totally spill on the kid of the good—basically its mini-me—instead of just droppin’ the offspring tea.

by all means, he said—spill the deets on the kid, and you’ll forever be in our squad’s debt for the full parent saga.

i do wish, i replied, that i could drop the full account of the parent and not just the mini version; so, take this little bonus as interest, and know that i ain’t here to serve fake tea, even though i’m not out here tryna hoodwink you.

we’ll keep it 100 and take all the care we can—proceed.

yes, i said, but first i gotta vibe on the same wavelength with you and remind you of what i’ve been dropping throughout this chat and on so many other days.

what?

the old tea—that there’s a whole lot of beautiful and a whole lot of good, and the same goes for all the stuff we describe and name; for everything in that mix, we slap the label ‘many’ on it.

true, he said.

and then there’s one absolute beauty and one absolute good, and for all the other things we call ‘many,’ there’s an absolute too; they can be united under one vibe, which we call the essence of each.

mad true.

the many, like we say, are what we peep but don’t really get, and the ideas are the ones we truly know even though we never see them.

exactly.

and what’s the tool we use to check out all visible stuff?

the sight, he said.

and with our ears, i said, we catch sounds, and our other senses scoop up all the rest?

true.

but have you peeped that sight is, like, the most expensive and complicated masterpiece the original creator of our senses ever cooked up?

nah, i never pegged that, he said.

then think on it; does the ear or the voice need some extra add-on to do its thing—so that one can pick up sound and the other can be heard?

not at all.

no, indeed, i replied; and the same goes for pretty much all our other senses—you wouldn’t say any of them need a bonus feature, right?

definitely not.

but peep this: without an extra-level glow-up, there’s no way to see or be seen.

how you mean?

sight, as i’m vibing it, lives in the eyes; and if someone’s got eyes but they’re wishy-washy at peeping, even if colors are lit within them, unless there’s a third-level upgrade built just for that, the eye owner won’t peep a thing and those colors will just be invisible.

what kind of nature you talkin’ about?

i replied—it’s that drip you call light.

true, he said.

so, mad noble is the bond that hooks up sight and all things visible, and it’s way more epic than any other link because of that extra natural flex; 'cause light is their ride-or-die, and light is no basic, ignoble thing.

nah, he said—the total opposite of ignoble.

and which of the gods up in the heavens do you say is the boss of this whole element? who’s flexin’ that light that lets our eyes peep perfectly and makes the visible pop off?

you mean the sun, like you and literally everyone call it.

can we say the hookup between sight and that deity goes a little something like this?

how?

are you saying neither sight nor the eyeball itself is the sun?

no.

yet, out of all our sense tools, the eye is hella the most like the sun, right?

by far the most like.

and the power the eye’s got is like a drip that gets poured straight from the sun?

exactly.

so, the sun ain’t sight itself but is the OG author of sight—the one our peepers recognize as the source.

true, he said.

and this, i said, is who i call the child of the good, the one that the good spawned in its own epic likeness to rock the visible world—relating to sight and all that peeper stuff—just like the good is to the mind and all mental vibes:

can you break that down a bit more? he said.

why, you know, i said, that when eyes are pointed at stuff where the sun’s out—where day isn’t ghosting out, but it’s just moon and stars doing a slow-mo glow—the vision gets dim and almost blind; it’s like the clarity just dips out.

mad true.

but when they’re aimed at sunlit things, boom—they’re clear as day and that’s proper sight, right?

for sure.

and the soul is basically like the eye: when it lounges on what radiates truth and real being, it totally perceives, understands, and shines with mad smarts; but if it’s turned toward the twilight of fake, perishing vibes, then it’s stuck with just opinions—it keeps flipping from one opinion to another like no stable drip, barely flexing any real intelligence.

exactly.

now, the thing that gives truth to what’s known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i want you to call the idea of good—and you’ll vibe that it’s the main cause of science and truth, inasmuch as truth becomes the subject of knowing; and, since both truth and knowledge are mad beautiful, you’ll def rate this extra nature as even more stunning than either; and just like light and sight are, in a way, like the sun but aren’t the sun, so too science and truth may be seen like the good—but not the actual good; the good sits on a way higher pedestal.

how dope must that beauty be, he said, that which originates science and truth and yet outshines both; you can’t really be saying that pleasure is the good, right?

god forbid, i replied; but can i ask you to peep the image from another angle?

from which angle?

wouldn’t you say that the sun isn’t only the boss of making everything visible but also the plug for generation, nourishment, and mad growth, even though the sun itself isn’t about generating?

definitely.

in the same way, the good might be seen as not only the OG source of knowledge for all known stuff but also the vibe that gives their very essence, even though the good isn’t the essence itself—it totally exceeds essence in mad dignity and power.

glaucon, sounding hilariously serious, said: by the light of heaven, how amazing!

yes, i said, and you can blame your overdrive for making me drop all these wild fancies.

and please, keep spitting them out; at least, let us know if there’s more to the sun analogy.

yes, i said, there’s hella more.

then don’t leave out any single deet, however minor.

i’ll do my best, i said; but honestly, a ton might have to get chopped.

i hope not, he said.

so, picture this: there are two ruling powers—one that rules the intellectual realm and the other that runs the visible game. i’m not saying “heaven” because, trust, i ain’t tryna play with that name-drop (‘ourhanoz, orhatoz’ and all that). can i assume you got the diff between the visible and the intelligible on lock?

i have.

now, imagine a line cut into two uneven pieces, then split each piece again by the same ratio—let’s say the two main splits represent the visible and the intelligible. then, peep the subdivisions for how clear or hazy they are: you’ll see that the visible vibe is all about images. and by images, i mean, first off, shadows, and then, reflections in water and on smooth, polished, dope surfaces and the like—feel me?

yes, i understand.

now picture the other half, which isn’t just a copy, but includes all the real-deal animals we peep and every living thing or crafted vibe.

mad good.

would you admit that these two splits roll with different degrees of truth, and that the fake copy is to the original what the sphere of opinion is to the realm of straight-up knowledge?

most undoubtedly.

next, let's break it down: we gotta split the intellectual realm in a major way.

in what way, you ask?

so here's the tea: there are two subdivisions. in the lower squad, the soul flexes the figures from the first division as its inspo; this inquiry is totally hypothetical, and instead of leveling up to an ultimate principle, it dips down the other end. meanwhile, in the upper crew, the soul yeets past hypotheses and climbs up to a principle that’s already above the hypothesis game—no cap, it doesn’t even use images like before, just vibing purely in and through the ideas themselves.

"i do not quite understand your meaning," he said.

alright, imma hit you with a redo; you'll catch my drift once i drop some starter notes. you know how peeps studying geometry, arithmetic, and all those related sciences be assuming the odd, the even, the figures, three kinds of angles, and that sorta stuff in their various branches—these are their hypotheses, the baseline memes everyone is supposed to know, so they don’t even waste time explaining them to themselves or others; they just kick off with them and ride the wave until they finally, and in a straight-up consistent way, hit their conclusion?

"yes," he said, "i know."

and you already know that even though they’re using visible forms and chatting about them, they aren’t really about those physical vibes—they’re thinking about the ideals that these forms mimic; not the drawn-out figures, but the absolute square, the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms they sketch or whip up, which have their own shadows and water-reflections, get flipped into memes, but the real hustle is to peep the things themselves, which can only be seen with the mind’s eye.

that’s facts.

and this is what i meant by the intelligible squad—even though in the search for it the soul is forced to lean on some hypotheses; it doesn’t climb up to a first principle ‘cause it’s lowkey stuck in the hypothesis zone, but instead it uses objects whose shadows below are, in turn, turned into images that are extra clear and high-key valuable.

"i understand," he said, "so you're talking about the geometry crew and their sister arts."

and when i mention the other division of the intelligible, know that i'm dishing about that other type of knowledge where pure reason itself level ups via dialectic—using hypotheses not as the ultimate starters, but just as checkpoints, as stepping stones into a realm beyond hypotheses, so that it can soar past them to the first principle of the whole kit and caboodle; and by clinging to that and then to whatever builds on it, step by step, it descends again without leaning on any sensory drip—flowing from idea to idea until it ends completely in ideas.

"i get you," he replied; "not perfectly though, ‘cause you’re describing a task that’s, like, absolutely colossal; but, anyway, i understand that you're saying that knowledge and being—the stuff that dialectic scopes out—are way clearer than the so-called notions of the arts that are built only on hypotheses. these too are peeped by the mind, not by the senses; yet since they kick off with hypotheses instead of rising to a proper principle, the peepers on them aren’t really flexing their higher reason—unless, like, someone adds a first principle so the higher reason can actually vibe with them. and that habitual hustle in geometry and the related sciences, i guess you'd call that understanding and not pure reason, 'cause it sits between opinion and full-on reason."

"you totally nailed my drift," i said; "so now, matching up with these four divisions, let’s assign four mental faculties in the soul—reason being the top-tier, understanding the second, faith (or conviction) the third, and perception of shadows the last—and let’s set a scale where each faculty’s clarity matches the truth of what it’s all about."

"i understand," he replied, "and i’m down with your setup."

book vii.

and now, let me flex a lit image of just how enlightened or, frankly, sus our nature can be: behold—human beings living in an underground cave, which has one big open mouth facing the light that vibes along the whole cave; these peeps have been stuck here since childhood, with their legs and necks chained so they can only peep straight ahead, locked in by the chains so no head-turning is allowed. above and behind them, a fire is blazin' in the distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there's a raised walkway; and if you squint, you’ll catch a low wall built along that way, sorta like the screen puppet masters use to show off their marionettes.

"i see," he said.

and do you see, i continued, dudes (or dudettes) cruising along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, statues, and figures of animals made of wood, stone, or whatever random material, which pop up over the wall? some of 'em spit out chatter, while others are dead silent.

"you just dropped a wild image on me—these prisoners are seriously sus," he said.

"exactly like us," i replied; "and they only peep their own shadows or the shadows of each other, which the fire throws on the far wall of the cave?"

"true dat," he said; "how else would they see but the shadows when they can’t even turn their heads?"

"and for the stuff that’s carried along, they'd only peep the shadow drip?"

"deadass," he said.

"and if they started chatting with each other, wouldn't they think they were naming the actual objects that were passing by?"

"for real," he replied.

and picture this: if the cave even had an echo bouncing from the other side, wouldn't they be tripping when one of the passersby speaks, thinking that the voice they hear is coming straight from the rolling shadow?

"no question," he said.

to them, i said, the truth would literally be nothing but the shadow memes of the images.

"that’s on point," he said.

and now, peep this: imagine what naturally goes down if the prisoners get freed and get a serious reality check. initially, when one of them is yeeted out and forced to stand up, twist his neck around, and walk toward the light, his brain's gonna get hit with some brutal pain; the glare will be extra, and he won’t be able to peep the real objects that back when he only saw the shadow drip; then, imagine someone telling him, like, "yo, what you saw before was just an illusion, but now, as you creep closer to the real, your vision is leveling up"—what’s gonna be his clapback? picture further that his teacher starts pointing at the objects as they roll by and making him name them—wouldn't he be totally shook? wouldn’t he think that the shadow memes he used to peep were actually more on point than these new objects?

"totally," he said.

and if he’s forced to glance straight into the light, wouldn't his eyes beg for mercy and make him turn away, retreating to the objects he can handle, which he’d think are, in fact, clearer than the stuff being thrown at him now?

"true dat," he said.

and imagine one more time, he’s reluctantly dragged up a steep, rough-as-heck climb, and held down until he’s forced into face time with the sun itself—wouldn't he be all kinds of pained and irritated? coming closer to the light would totally dazzle his eyes, leaving him unable to peep any of what the normies call realities.

"not all in one sec," he said.

he’s gonna need to get used to the upper world’s vibe. first, he’ll nail the shadows, then the reflections of dudes and other objects in water, and next, the objects in the flesh; after that, he’ll be vibing with the glow of the moon and stars and that spangled heaven, and by night, the sky and star-memes will be clearer than the sun’s drip by day, right?

"for sure," he said.

lastly, he’ll be able to scope out the sun—not just as a watered-down reflection in the water, but peep it in its legit spot, not some remix vibe; and he’ll be chilling, contemplating it exactly as it is.

"definitely," he said.

he’ll then drop the knowledge that this luminous boss is the one who flexes the seasons and the years, the guardian of everything lit in the visible world, and in a way, the underlying cause of all the dope stuff he and his squad have been used to peeping.

"clearly," he said, "first he scopes the sun, then he wins at it."

and when he remembers his old crib and his old crew of cave-dwellers, wouldn’t he be all hyped about his glow-up while feeling a bit sorry for the ones still stuck in the dark?

"obviously, he’d be lowkey salty," he said.

and suppose further that the prisoners used to hand out mad honors among themselves for who could peep the quickest on the rolling shadows, who was riding ahead, who followed, and who could best spit conclusions about what’s coming next—do you reckon he’d be down for that hype or straight-up roast those clout-chasers? wouldn’t he be like, quoting homer, 

"better to be the poor servant of a poor master," 

and be okay with catching any l rather than buying into their fake clout and living that miserable life?

"deadass," he said, "i think he'd take any loss rather than keep rocking those bogus vibes and living in that trash state."

now, imagine once more, a dude who’s just been yeeted out of the sun and then slammed back into his old cave spot—wouldn’t his eyes be so filled with darkness that he’s completely lost?

"for sure," he said.

and if there was, like, a contest where he had to measure shadow drip alongside the peeps who never left the cave, while his sight’s still on beta mode (and it might take forever to get that upgrade), wouldn’t that be a total meme? folks would be like, "yo, he went up and came down without his eyes on fleek!" and say it's better not to even think about ascending; and if anyone even dared to yeet another up to the light, just cuff that offender and yeet him out for real.

"no doubt," he said.

this whole allegory, i said, you can now slap on to our earlier argument, dear glauccon—the cave’s the world of sight, the fire’s glow is the sun, and don't get it twisted if you peep the upward journey as the soul’s epic ascent into the intellectual realm, according to my humble vibe, which—if you’re down—I’ve dropped, whether spot-on or off, only the gods know. but, true or false, my take is that in the world of knowledge, the idea of the good shows up last and only after a struggle; and once seen, it’s also decoded as the universal source of all things bomb and right, the parent of light and the big boss of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual squad; and that’s the flex anyone trying to act rationally in public or private life must have their eyes locked on.

"i agree," he said, "as far as i can peep you."

moreover, i said, don't get it twisted that those who hit that beatific vision are gonna ghost on human drama; their souls are always sprinting toward the upper world where they wanna chill—which is hella natural, if our allegory’s on point.

"yes, very natural," he replied.

and is it wild when someone jumps from divine contemplation to the lame state of mortal life, misbehaving in an absolute clownish way; if, while his eyes are blinking and he hasn’t yet adjusted to the dark, he’s forced to throw down in courts of law or other spots, debating the images or just the shadow memes of justice, and trying to match wits with peeps who’ve never even peeped true justice?

"nothing but wild, i’d say," he replied.

anyone with common sense will recall that the eye’s trippin’ comes in two flavors, and stems from two causes—either from bouncing out of the light or crashing into it—and that’s as true for the mind’s eye as it is for the actual eyes; and if someone remembers this when they peep a dude with a wobbly, confused vision, they won’t be too quick to laugh—first they’ll be like, "yo, did that soul just emerge from a lit life and can’t handle the dark, or did he just flip from dark to day and get blinded by all that extra light?" and they’ll count one as being fortune’s favorite and feel pity for the other; or, if they’re in a mood to laugh at the soul that comes up from below into the light, there’s more reason to roast him than the dude who bounces from the light back into the cave.

"that’s a hella just distinction," he said.

but then, if i’m right, some of these so-called education professors are totally off when they claim they can just drop a whole new level of knowledge into a soul like it’s some firmware update—like implanting sight into blind peepers.

"they def say that," he replied.

whereas our vibe shows that the learning juice was already in the soul; just like an eye can’t turn from dark to light without the whole body getting involved, the knowledge tool only flips from the world of becoming to that of being when the whole soul moves, slowly leveling up to handle the full drip of being—and especially, the brightest, dopest kind of being, aka the good.

"facts, no cap."

and must there not be some art that can trigger this conversion in the quickest, easiest way; not by implanting sight (since that shiz is already there, just looking the wrong way), but by simply redirecting it so it peeps straight into truth?

"yes," he said, "such an art is def within the realm of possibility."

and while the other so-called virtues of the soul are kinda like bodily stats—‘cause even if they ain’t originally loaded, they can be boosted later by habit and grind—the virtue of wisdom straight-up flexes a divine element that always sticks, and thanks to that, it turns out hella useful and profitable; or else, it can be straight-up toxic and trash. have you ever noticed that narrow sparks of smarts flashing from the cunning eye of a slick rogue—how he’s all hyped, how his tiny soul sees the cheat code to his end; he’s basically the opposite of blind, but his sharp vision gets hijacked into serving evil, and his mischievousness is proportional to his clout?

"deadass true," he said.

but what if back in the day there was a sort of pre-cut for these natures; if in their youth they got snipped away from those heavy sensual pleasures—like munching and sippin’, which, like lead weights, were strapped to them from birth and dragged them down, twisting their vision onto the low-tier—if, i say, they’d been freed from these laggy loads and their gaze got flipped in the opposite direction, then that same eye would peep truth as clearly as it peeps any other lit image right now.

"pretty likely," he said.

yes, i said; and here’s another thing that’s either likely or, more like, a necessary take from all this: neither the uneducated, the truth-clueless, nor even those who never wrap up their never-ending education can be solid ministers of state; not the former because they lack one core vibe of duty that’s the rule over all their actions, private and public alike; and not the latter because they only act when forced, tripping that they’re already living it up ina chill island vibe.

"very true," he replied.

then, i said, the hustle for us who are the OG state-builders is to force the absolute dopest minds to snag that knowledge we already showed to be the ultimate flex—they gotta keep ascending until they hit the good; but once they’ve ascended and peeped enough, we can’t let them ghost the squad like they do now.

"what do you mean?" he asked.

i mean that they should remain chillin' in the upper world—but that vibe isn’t legit in the long run; they must be hauled back down into the cave with those still locked in, and made to share in the grind and even enjoy the honors, whether they’re actually worthy or not.

"but isn’t that super sus?" he said; "should we really drop them into a worse life when they could be living the high life?"

you’ve forgotten, my friend, i said, "the legislator never planned to crown one class as extra happy above the rest; the real hustle was for the whole state to vibe as one, held together by both persuasion and necessity, making everyone a benefactor to one another. he created them not just to get their own clout, but to serve as the ultimate glue binding up the state."

"true," he said, "i almost forgot that."

peep this, glauccon, i said: there’s zero injustice in forcing our philosopher homies to care about the squad—they’ll understand that in other states, dudes like them aren’t obliged to dive into the political grind; and that’s fair 'cause they’re raised on their own chill tempo, and the government basically dips on them. but we brought you into this game to be the rulers of the hive, kings of your own clout and of all the peeps, and we leveled you up way better and more perfectly than those other chumps—so you’re ready for the double duty. therefore, each one of you, when your time drops, must roll down to the common underground spot and get used to seeing in the dark. once you nail that habit, you’ll peep ten thousand times better than those cave dwellers, and you’ll know exactly what all these images mean and represent, ‘cause you’ve seen the beautiful, the just, and the good in all its truth. and that way, our state—which is also yours—will be the real deal, not just some daydream, and run in a vibe unlike those other states where dudes be beefing over mere shadow memes and getting distracted chasing clout, which in their eyes is the top good. the truth is, the state where the rulers are hella reluctant to rule is always the chillest and most on-point, while the state with rulers hyped up on power is just a hot mess.

"most true," he replied.

and when our pupils hear all this, will they straight-up refuse to take their turn in the state grind because they get to chill under heavenly light all day?

"impossible," he answered; "‘cause they're just real peeps, and the orders we drop are legit. there’s zero doubt that each one of them will take on the duty as a hardcore necessity, not in that tricked-out way of our current state rulers."

"yes, my friend," i said; "and here’s the kicker. you gotta design for your future rulers a life that’s next-level better than just that of a standard ruler, and then you’ll have a well-ordered state; ‘cause only in a state that dishes out that upgraded vibe will it be ruled by peeps who are truly rich—not in basic silver and gold, but rich in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. if they slide into public affairs all hungry for their own gain, thinking they’re snatching the chief good, there’ll be zero order; ‘cause they’ll be brawling over office, and the ensuing civil and domestic beef will straight-up ruin the rulers and the entire state.

"most true," he replied.

and the only life that can straight-up diss the hustle for political clout is that of real philosophy. do you even know any other way?

"indeed, i don't," he said.

and should the state rulers even be clout-lovers? ‘cause if they are, rival clout-lovers will pop off and start beefing.

"no question," he concluded.

who then are those we’re low‑key forcing to be our guardians? fr, they’re gonna be the dopest dudes—those who are hella woke on state tea, bossing up the whole setup, and living a life mad superior to basic politics, no cap.

“they are the men, and imma choose ‘em,” he replied.

and now, shall we vibe on how these epic guardians get spawned and totally glow‑up from the darkness into straight-up lit mode—as if they yeeted themselves from the underworld up to the gods?

“bet,” he replied.

“the process, i said, isn’t just about flipping an oyster shell (yo, shoutout to that old‑skool game where peeps bounced or chased based on whether the shell landed dark‑side up or lit‑side up), it’s more like the ultimate soul 180—from a day barely better than night to that true day of being, fam, the ascent from below that we straight up call true philosophy?”

“facts.”

“and shouldn’t we peep which kind of brain fuel can drag the soul from becoming meh to actually being? oh, and btw, remember that our young bloods are supposed to be warrior athletes?”

“yup, that was said.”

“then this new flavor of knowledge gotta bring extra sauce—must be mad useful in war.”

“deadass, if possible.”

“there were two parts in our old‑school edu plan, weren’t there?”

“just so.”

“one part was gym—like the hardcore gym sesh that ran the body’s gains and eventual decay, low‑key linked to generation and corruption, right?”

“true.”

“so that’s not the brain juice we’re tryna uncover?”

“nah.”

“but yo, what about music, which also had a cameo in our previous scheme?”

“music, as you’ll recall, was the yin to gym’s yang—it schooled our guardians through habit vibes, making ‘em harmonious and rhythm‑flexed, but it wasn’t about dropping real science; whether the words were wild tales or maybe even true, they carried the same rhythmic drip. but honestly, music didn’t serve that epic upgrade you’re chasing.”

“spot on, in your recollection; music def didn’t come with that level of truth.”

“so what branch of knowledge, my dear glaucon, has that next‑level vibe we crave, since all our utilitarian arts came off as basic?”

“undoubtedly; but if we ghost music, gym, and the arts too, what’s left?”

“yo, i said, maybe our exclusive subjects are all ghosted—in which case we gotta roll with something basic, a universal flex that every art, science, and brainiac vibes with from the get‑go.”

“so what could that be?”

“it’s gotta be that low‑key skill we all pick up: telling one, two, and three apart—that is, number and calculation. don’t all arts and sciences dip into that pool?”

“yes.”

“then the art of war definitely rides that math wave, right?”

“to be sure.”

“so check it: whenever palamedes pops up in a tragedy, he seriously throws shade at agamemnon, calling him ridiculously unfit as a general. did you not notice how he flexed that he invented numbers—he even counted the ships and lined up the troy troops—implying they’d never been counted before and that agamemnon, like, couldn’t even count his own kicks? if the dude was clueless on numbers, then what kinda general was he supposed to be?”

“i’d say he’d be one weird af general if that’s the tea.”

“can we seriously front that a warrior shouldn’t be dialed into basic arithmetic?”

“certainly he should, if he wants even a smidge of military tactics—or, honestly, if he wants to be a man at all.”

“i wanna know, do you see arithmetic the same way i do?”

“what’s your take?”

“i think it’s exactly the kind of study we need—a vibe that naturally sparks reflection, even if it hasn’t been fully exploited yet; its real mission is to pull the soul from just ‘becoming’ into straight-up being.”

“explain that, fam?” he said.

“i’ll try, i said—just vibe with me and hit a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as i break down which branches of knowledge pack that pull, so we can be 100% sure arithmetic is, like, one of them.”

“explain,” he said.

“i mean, our sense objects come in two vibes: some are so obvious that your senses handle the call without any brain work, while others are mad sus, forcing you to dive deep for the extra deets.”

“you’re straight up talking about how our senses get messed with by distance and all that dope light and shade, huh?”

“nah, i said, that’s not what i meant at all.”

“so what’s the real tea then?”

“when i say ‘uninviting objects’, i mean those that don’t flip from one vibe to its opposite; but ‘inviting objects’ do, where your senses—whether up close or from afar—serve equal deets on both sides. check it: here are three fingers—a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.”

“lit.”

“picture ‘em right in front of you; and here’s the kicker: each one just vibes as a finger—whether seen mid‑range or at the edge, whether white or black, thick or thin—it don’t matter; a finger is a finger, period. so you ain’t gotta ask, ‘what even is a finger?’ because your sight never twists it into something else.”

“true.”

“and so, i said, as expected, there’s nothing here that even triggers deep brainwave.”

“nah, there isn’t,” he replied.

“but what about the scale—big finger, small finger? can our peepers really lock that down? does it matter if one’s in the middle and another on the edge? same with touch—can it really flex on thick versus thin, soft versus hard? like, do our senses ever serve up perfect tea on those vibes? it seems like if a sense catches on hardness, it’s also picking up softness, only hintin’ that the same thing can feel both ways.”

“facts,” he said.

“and like, isn’t the soul gonna be totally bamboozled by getting that a hard vibe can also come off soft? what’s the even meaning of light versus heavy if the same thing can flip between both?”

“yep, he said—those hints the soul gets are hella weird and definitely need some breakdown.”

“exactly, i said, and in these mindfucks, the soul naturally calls in arithmetic and pure intel to figure out if what’s being seen is one thing or split into two.”

“facts.”

“and if it turns out to be two, then each is a distinct unit, right?”

“certainly.”

“and if each is one, yet together they make two, then you clearly see they’re in a state of division—cause if they were undivided, you’d just peep one big vibe.”

“true.”

“the eye might catch both little and big, but in a fuzzy, no‑details manner; it just doesn’t break it down.”

“yes.”

“whereas the thinking mind, tryna clear the chaos, flips the switch and sets little and big apart, no mix‑up.”

“very true.”

“isn’t that where we first started asking, ‘what’s great?’ and ‘what’s small?’”

“exactly so.”

“and that’s how the epic split between what’s visible and what’s understood on a higher level was born.”

“most true.”

“this is exactly what i meant by saying that impressions dropping dual vibes hype the intellect—while those that don’t just leave the brain chillin’.”

“i get it, he said, totally vibing with you.”

“so, where do unity and number even slot in?”

“i dunno,” he replied.

“think about it a bit, and you’ll see that everything i just dropped answers that; cuz if simple unity was obvious to our eyes or any sense, then—just like with the finger—there’d be zero pull toward true being. but when there’s this constant low‑key contradiction, where one flips into its opposite and sparks the idea of many, that’s when the brain kicks into overdrive and the soul, all perplexed, is like, ‘yo, what’s absolute unity?’ and that, fam, is how the study of the one pulls your mind into contemplating true being.”

“and real talk, he said, this totally goes down with one—like, one can be both singular and, like, endless in its vibes?”

“yep, i said; if it holds for one, then it def applies to all numbers.”

“certainly.”

“and arithmetic and all that calculation biz are basically about numbers too, right?”

“yes.”

“and they seriously guide the mind toward the real truth?”

“yes, in a very remarkable manner.”

“so, this is the kind of knowledge we’re on the hunt for—double‑duty for both war and deep philosophy; cuz a warrior who can’t count his troops is straight‑up lost, and a philosopher who ain’t math‑savvy won’t escape the chaotic sea of becoming. hence, he’s gotta be an arithmetic boss.”

“that is true.”

“so our guardian is both a warrior and a philosopher?”

“certainly.”

“then this is the kind of knowledge that laws should be all over—our future top dogs of the state need to be pushed to grind on arithmetic, not as random dabblers, but until they can peep the nature of numbers purely with their minds; not like some merchant tryna hustle for quick cash, but for the sake of killer military moves and that essential soul glow‑up—’cause that’s the easiest ride from just tryna be to full‑on being.”

“that is excellent,” he said.

“yes, i said, and now that we’re on this, gotta drop: arithmetic is super charming and slays in so many ways toward our goals—if you vibe with it like a full‑on philosopher rather than a sketchy shopkeeper!”

“how do you mean?”

“what i mean is, arithmetic seriously elevates the soul—forcing it to flex on abstract numbers and straight‑up rebel against throwing in cringey, tangible distractions. you know how the math masters always roast anyone who even tries to split absolute unity when crunching numbers? like, if you divide, they multiply (either because they consolidate the number by shutting down fraction drama, or they see division as just another form of multiplication, keeping one intact), ensuring that ‘one’ stays pure and doesn’t get lost in a mess of fractions.”

“that is very true.”

“now, suppose some dude rolls up and goes, ‘yo my friends, what’s the low‑down on these epic numbers you’re dropping—numbers with that unity you demand, where every unit is equal, unshakeable, and indivisible?’ what would the math squad say?”

“they’d say, as i figure, that they’re talking about numbers that can only be vibed in the mind.”

“so, you see that this knowledge is truly necessary—demanding pure, unfiltered intelligence to snag real truth?”

“yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.”

“and have you peeped that those who naturally flex on calculation tend to be way quicker on every other type of knowledge? even the basic noobs, if they’ve been schooled in arithmetic, end up way sharper than they’d otherwise be.”

“very true,” he said.

“and honestly, you won’t easily find a study as hardcore as arithmetic.”

“you will not.”

“and for all these reasons, arithmetic is the kind of brainfood that the best peeps should totally train in—and it’s not something we can ever just ghost.”

“i agree.”

“let this be locked in as one of our core edu subjects. and next, are we down to see if its kin science also vibes with us?”

“you mean geometry?”

“exactly so.”

“clearly, he said, we’re all about that side of geometry that’s linked to war; cuz whether you’re pitching a camp, locking down a position, or fine‑tuning the battle lines during a real skirmish or on the march, it’s a total game‑changer if your general is a geometry boss.”

“yes, i said, but for tactical moves a bit of geometry or calc will do the trick; it’s more about that advanced geometry which somehow helps you peep the true idea of good—since everything naturally pushes your soul to lock its gaze on that spot where true perfection of being is, which it def should witness.”

“true,” he said.

“so if geometry makes the soul peep true being, then it’s on our plate; but if it’s just about becoming, nah, it ain’t our vibe.”

“yes, that is what we assert.”

“yet anyone who’s even dipped their toes in geometry will agree that this view totally clashes with the everyday geometric chatter.”

“how so?”

“they stick to hardcore practice—always yapping about squaring, expanding, applying, etc.—totally confusing geometry’s true essence with basic daily needs; but the real aim of geometry is pure, eternal knowledge.”

“certainly,” he said.

“then shouldn’t we drop an extra admission?”

“what admission?”

“that geometry is all about aiming for eternal truth, not just some fleeting, temporary nonsense.”

“that, he replied, is totally fair and true.”

“then, my noble friend, geometry will pull the soul toward truth, spark that philosopher spirit, and elevate what’s now sadly slumping.”

“nothing else is gonna have that kind of impact.”

“so nothing should be more strictly enforced than making sure the peeps of your dope city learn geometry. plus, geometry drops extra bonus vibes that are hella huge.”

“of what kind?” he said.

“i said, there’s the military boost you mentioned; and in every field of knowledge, experience shows that anyone who studies geometry is mad quick on the uptake compared to those who don’t.”

“yes indeed,” he said, “there’s an infinite gap between them.”

“then are we cool with making this our second key edu branch for our youth?”

“let’s do so,” he replied.

“and suppose we add astronomy as branch three—what’s your take?”

“i’m totally down for that,” he said; “tracking seasons, months, and years is as clutch for a general as it is for a farmer or a sailor.”

“i’m low‑key amused, i said, by how you’re tripping about coming off as if you’re forcing useless studies; and i totally get the struggle of believing that every dude’s got a soul‑eye which, when dulled by other lame pursuits, gets re‑illuminated by these teachings—and that it’s way more precious than like, ten thousand physical eyes, since that one eye is the only one that sees pure truth. now, there are basically two kinds of peeps: one squad that digs your words like they’re pure revelations, and another that thinks it’s just idle chatter with zero profit. so, you gotta decide which crew you’re rollin’ with. you’ll probably say you’re here mainly for your own glow‑up, while not minding if others scoop some benefits too.”

“i think i'd rather roll this argument for my own level‑up.”

“then hold up—let’s step back, cuz we've totally messed up the order of our subjects.”

“what did we do wrong?” he asked.

“i said, right after plane geometry, we went full send into solids in revolution instead of chillin’ with solids as they are; we should’ve rolled from the second dimension into the third—the one that’s all about cubes and depth.”

“that is true, socrates; but honestly, there’s mad nothin’ out there on these subjects yet.”

“why, yes, i said, and for two reasons: first, no government is backing them—which kills the energy to chase ‘em since they’re super hard; and second, students can’t really tackle ‘em without a legit director. but a director’s hard to find, and even if one shows up, our ego‑trippin’ students wouldn’t give him a second glance. that’d be different if the whole state was running the show for these studies and giving ‘em mad honor; then disciples would be lining up nonstop and discoveries would be drip‑feeding in. even now, even though the world totally disses them and they’re all outta proportion with no one claiming their use, these subjects push through with natural charm—and if the state had their back, they’d definitely bust into the light someday.”

“yes,” he said, “they got remarkable charm. but i don’t get the switch‑up in order. first, you kicked off with plane geometry?”

“yes,” i said.

“and then you dropped astronomy right after, and then stepped back?”

“yes, and i kinda rushed—sorry; the wack state of solid geometry, which should’ve naturally come next, forced me to skip over it and jump straight to astronomy, aka the motion of solids.”

“true,” he said.

“then assuming that the now‑omitted science would totally drop into existence if given state love, let’s continue with astronomy as the fourth branch.”

“that’s the right order,” he replied.

“and now, socrates, since you clapped down on my lame way of praising astronomy before, my hype will now be in your own epic vibe. because, i honestly think, everyone gotta see that astronomy pushes the soul to look up and lifts us from this world into another.”

“everyone but me,” i said; “for others it might be obvious, but for me it’s still a head‑scratcher.”

“and what then would you say?”

“i’d say that when folks try to elevate astronomy into philosophy, they end up making us look downward instead of upward.”

“what do you mean?” he asked.

“you, i replied, hold this ultra‑sublime concept of knowing the higher things. i dare say that if some dude leans back to study a fancy, fretted ceiling, you’d still reckon that his mind is doing the real perceiving—not his eyes. and you’re probably right, and i might be a noob; but in my view, only that knowledge about true being and what’s unseen makes the soul look up. like, if a guy’s just gawking at the heavens or, on the flip side, staring at the ground trying to scoop some sensory detail, i’d argue he ain’t actually learning—because that stuff isn’t science; his soul’s locked on looking down, whether he’s cruising by water or on foot, floating or just chilling on his back.”

“i acknowledge,” he said, “your roast is legit. still, i’d really like to figure out how astronomy can be learned in a way that seriously vibes with the kind of knowledge we’re talking about.”

yo, listen up fam, i gotta spit you this: the starry heaven we’re lowkey peepin’ is built on a visible drip ground, so even tho it’s the absolute aesthetic and most on-point of all seen stuff, it’s still way inferior to the legit moves of absolute fast vibes and absolute slow vibes—both interlinked and carrying that full-on true number and every prime figure flex. and btw, these moves are for your brain’s big flex, not what you catch with your peepers.

"true," he clapped back.

yo, the lit, spangled heavens are meant to be our blueprint for that higher level knowledge; their glow is like the aesthetic of pics or figures mad mastered by daedalus or some other legendary artist we might randomly peep. any geometry whiz who scopes them would be straight-up shook by the finesse of their craft—but they’d never even entertain the idea of snagging the true equal, the true duplicate, or the actual ratio of any other level of drip.

"nah fam, that idea’s straight-up clownin’," he replied.

and ain’t a real astro influencer gonna vibe the same when he watches the star moves? won’t he think that heaven and all its contents are curated by the ultimate creator in the most flawless way? but yo, he’d never even imagine the ratios of night to day, or day to month, or month to year, or even stars to stars, and all the other visible, material drip being eternal and never glitchin’—that’d be hella absurd; and it’s equally wack to stress so hard over pinning down their exact specs.

i’m deadass vibing with that, though i never peeped it that way before.

then, i dropped some knowledge: in astronomy, just like in geometry, we gotta flex with problems and leave the literal heavens alone if we wanna approach the subject the right way and make that natural brainpower actually count.

"that, my dude, is way above our current astro squad," he said.

"facts, and there’s a whole bunch of other stuff that needs that same insane upgrade if our laws are gonna be on point. but yo, can you hit me with any other dope studies?" i asked.

"nah," he replied, "not without some deep vibes."

"motion, bro, comes in mad flavors—there isn’t just one lane; there are two moves so obvious even to peeps like us, and then there’s extra sauce saved for the real OGs," i explained.

"but yo, where’s the two?" he pressed.

"i said, there’s a second vibe that’s basically the ear-version of what the eyes do," i explained. "like, just as your eyes are tuned to peep the stars, your ears are meant to catch those harmonious moves. they’re like twin sciences—as the pythagoreans say, and you, glauc-on, are totally with that, right?"

"yup," he replied.

"but here’s the tea: this study is mad grind, so we should bounce and learn from them; they’ll clue us in if there’s any other legit flex in these sciences. meanwhile, let’s not ghost our ultimate higher goal."

"what’s that even?" he asked.

"there’s a perfection that every bit of knowledge should hit, and our squad of learners should level up to it too—no half-steppin’, like what happened in astro. cuz in the harmony game, as you def know, the same drama goes down. the harmony teachers compare sounds and spreads you can only hear, but their hustle—like that of the astro crew—is kinda wasted."

"facts, by the gods!" he exclaimed. "it’s like watching a play when they start dissing their 'condensed notes'—as they call them—hunching their ears up like they’re snooping on a neighbor’s playlist. one squad claims they spot an in-between note and discovered the tiniest spot that should be the standard measure; while others are all like, 'nah, these two sounds are vibing the same,' with each crew putting their ears before their big brain."

"you mean, bro, those dudes who straight-up mess with the strings, tweaking them on the instrument’s pegs? i could keep runnin’ with that metaphor and drop deets on how the plectrum slaps the strings—calling out their lag and hyperdrive in sound—but that’d get old real quick. so imma just say i’m not talking about those clowns; i mean the pythagoreans, whom i was just about to school on harmony. like the astro peeps, they’re off-key—they crunch the numbers in the harmonies they hear but never nail down the real probs. in other words, they never tap into the natural harmony of numbers or break down why some digits vibe together while others don’t."

"that, my dude, is some next-level, beyond-mortal knowledge," he said.

"i’d call it useful, tho—if you’re chasing the vibe of beauty and goodness; but if you’re on a different wavelength, it’s just straight-up useless," i replied.

"big facts," he agreed.

now, when all these studies start linking up and vibing together, and when we peep their mutual connections, then—and only then—will chasing them really pay off for our goals; otherwise, it’s just extra work for zero gains.

"i feel you; but socrates, you’re talking about a mega quest," he said.

"what are you saying? is this just the trailer? don’t you know it’s the preface to the actual main banger we gotta learn? cuz you ain’t gonna call a math genius a dialectician, right?"

"def not," he said. "i barely know any mathematician who can actually drop logical truth."

"but do you seriously think that peeps who can’t throw a reason around will ever have the knowledge we need?" i asked.

"can’t even imagine that," he agreed.

"so, glauc-on," i said, "we’ve finally landed on what i call the hymn of dialectic. this jam is all about the intellect, even though your eyes might try to mimic it. remember, our eyes eventually got to peep real animals, the stars, and finally even the sun. just like with dialectic: when someone starts hunting for the absolute truth using only that pure brain light—no sensory crutches—and grinds until, through sheer intelligence, they hit the absolute good, they eventually reach the finish line of the intellectual realm, like how vision ends at the border of the visible."

"facts," he agreed.

"so this is the glow-up you call dialectic?"

"true," he replied, "no cap."

"but check it: the liberation of the chained homies, the flip from shadow-mode to full-on light and images, the rise from the underground dens to bask in the sun—even as they struggle to peep animals, plants, and the solar drip with their weak eyes, yet can still catch the divine reflections in water (straight-up heavenly), which are just the shadows of true existence (not the lame fire-shadow imitations compared to the sun’s real glow)—this mega power of lifting the soul’s highest vibe to contemplate the absolute best in existence (like leveling up the body’s natural light to catch the brightest drip in the material world) is all thanks to that grind and chase in the arts i just broke down."

"i’m 100% with you on that," he replied. "it may sound wild, but from another angle it’s even harder to deny. look, this isn’t just a side hustle topic—it’s something we gotta loop over again and again. so whether our final vibe ends up true or false, let’s roll with it and bounce right from the preface into the chief jam (yeah, a play on the greek term that means both 'law' and 'strain') and break that down too. lay it on me: what’s the essence and the splits of dialectic, and what trails lead there? ‘cause these trails are also our ticket to final chill."

"dear glauc-on," i said, "you might not catch my full drift right here, even though i’m gonna do my best. you’ll peep more than just an image—you’ll glimpse the absolute truth, at least in my book. whether what i dropped on you is fully reality i can’t even promise; but i’m hella confident you’ll see some legit realness."

"no cap," he replied.

"but gotta remember, only the raw power of dialectic can drop this level of truth—and that’s only for those who are already down with the previous knowledge squads."

"you can bank on that," he said.

"and seriously, no one’s gonna say there’s any other legit method—any regular process—to fully peep true existence or nail what each thing really is at its core. cuz, generally, the arts are all about human cravings and opinions, or they’re hyped for making stuff, building things, or keeping those builds alive; and the math sciences—which we mentioned, like geometry, have a slight boss factor in understanding true being—are just dreamin’ about existence. they never really catch wakeful reality as long as they leave those unexamined hypotheses hanging and can’t even break ‘em down. like, when a dude doesn’t even know his original base vibe, and when both his final take and all his in-between moves are built out of some unknown sauce, how can he think that lame chain of conventions will ever level up into true science?"

"impossible, bro," he said.

"so, dialectic—and only dialectic—goes straight to the original vibe and is the one science that yeets hypotheses to lock its ground down. it’s like the eye of the soul, which is literally sunk in a cray bog, but with its gentle assist it gets lifted right up high. and it squads up all those sciences we been chatting about as its homies in the conversion hustle. sure, folks call ‘em sciences, but they deserve a snazzier label—something that screams more clarity than just plain opinion but not full-on science. in our earlier sketch, we called that 'understanding.' but yo, why even sweat the names when we got heavy realities to peep?"

"why indeed," he said, "when any tag that nails the brain’s vibe clearly is all that matters?"

anyway, we’re cool with splitting things into four zones—two for intellect and two for opinion. we call the first zone science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth just shadow perception. opinion’s all about what’s coming into being, while intellect owns the state of being. so here’s the ratio:

as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as intellect vibes with opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to shadow perception.

but yo, let’s chill on drilling further into splitting up opinion and intellect—they’d take way longer than this chat.

"i get you," he said, "i’m totally with that."

and then i asked, "you also down with calling a dialectician the one who nails the true essence of every single thing? and if someone can’t flex that conception properly, can we say they’re failing on the intelligence front?"

"yes, how could i even front on that?" he replied.

"and you’d say the same goes for the vibe of 'good'? like, until someone can straight-up extract and rationally define what good is, and until they can run every clapback and shoot down objections—not just with opinions, but with straight-up absolute truth, never slipping at any step of the argument—you’d say they don’t even really know what good is; they only peep a weak shadow, something dished out by opinion and not by science. i mean, they’re out here sleepwalking through their life, and by the time they’re fully woke here, they hit the ultimate timeout in the underworld."

"on all that, i’m 100% with you," he said.

"and bet, you wouldn’t let the kiddos of your dream state—the ones you’re raising and schooling, assuming that ideal ever goes viral—slap future rulers who are just static, like basic posts with no reason in them, to run the highest-level deets?"

"def not," he replied.

"so you’d drop a law that they gotta get an education that levels them up to be the ultimate question-asking and answering legends, right?"

"yep, you and i, we’re co-creating that," he said.

so dialectic, as you’re vibing, is like the ultimate crown jewel of the sciences—it sits right on top, no other science can climb any higher. the nature of knowledge can’t get any more lit, right?

"i agree," he said.

"but who we hand these studies to, and how we dish ‘em out, are still big questions we gotta figure out."

"yep, totally," he agreed.

"remember how we picked the rulers before?" i reminded him.

"for sure," he said.

we still gotta choose the same real ones, giving mad props to the most solid and brave, and if possible, the freshest, most aesthetic homies; and with noble and generous vibes, they gotta have those natural boss gifts to make learning a breeze.

"and what gifts are those?" he asked.

"gifts like mad sharp focus and that clutch ability to pick up info super quick; cuz honestly, a brain usually taps out from hardcore study way before it taps out from gym drills. the grind is hella a brain thing, not a bod thing," i explained.

"big facts," he replied.

furthermore, the dude we’re scouting should have a killer memory and be an unwearied, solid bro who vibes with any hustle—otherwise, how’s he gonna survive all the hardcore physical drills and the insane brain grind we demand?

"definitely," he said. "he’s gotta come with those natural gifts."

here’s the lowkey mess right now: peeps studying philosophy ain’t got a true hustle, and that’s why philosophy’s gotten major disses. her true homies should be those who ride with her hand-in-hand, not these fake, off-brand wannabes.

"what u mean?" he asked.

"first off, her diehards shouldn’t be half-assed—i mean, they shouldn’t be half grind and half chill. like, say a dude loves gym, hunting, and all sorts of physical action but straight-up hates the grind of learning, listening, or deep diving into knowledge. or maybe his whole hustle is totally flipped, and he’s lacking in that intellectual hustle."

"for sure," he said.

"and about truth, isn’t a soul considered lame if it hates intentional lies and gets hella heated when someone tosses a fib, yet dangerously chill with accidental BS—like wallowing in ignorance with no shame when caught?"

"facts," he agreed.

"and again, when it comes to temperance, courage, magnificence, and all that other virtue, shouldn’t we peep the true bloodlines from the fakes? cuz if we can’t spot those real vibes, both the state and individuals will end up trippin’, and suddenly the state crowns someone as ruler or friend who’s missing key virtue juice—making them look lame or just a fake."

"that’s mad true," he said.

"so all this stuff is on us to really break down. and if only the peeps we drop into this massive edu system are solid in both bod and brain, then even justice herself won’t have any beef with us, and we’ll be straight-up saviors of the constitution and the state. but if our students are off in another lane, the tables flip and we end up drenching philosophy in even more ridicule than it’s already snaggin’."

"that’d be a total trainwreck," he said.

"def not," i replied, "but maybe by flipping from clownin’ around to serious vibes, i’m just as extra ridiculous."

"how so?" he asked.

"i forgot, i said, that we were just vibin’ and got way too hyped. when i peeped philosophy gettin’ mad dissed and trampled on by fools, i couldn’t help but feel a surge of indignation at the clout-stealers behind her downfall—and man, my anger went full savage mode."

"indeed! i was listening and wasn’t even trippin’ that hard," he said.

"but i, the one spitting this truth, totally felt it. and now lemme remind you that even though in our earlier picks we chose old heads, we can’t roll that way here. solon was straight-up trippin’ when he said old dudes can learn a ton—like, they can’t learn any more than they can sprint; youth is the prime time for that extra hustle."

"of course, fr," he replied.

"and so, math, geometry, and all those other ed vibes that pump you up for dialectic should be served to the brain from childhood; but never in a forced, no-chill edu vibe."

"why not tho?" he asked.

"cuz a free homie shouldn’t be turned into a slave for knowledge. forced physical training is cool for the bod, but forced brain drip? nah, that ain’t gonna lock in."

"mad true," he agreed.

"then, my good friend, i said, ditch the compulsion. let early education be pure amusement; that way you can peep someone’s natural flex better."

"that’s a hella rational vibe," he said.

"remember how the kiddos were supposed to catch a vibe watching battle rides on horseback? and if it’s all safe, they get up close so they can, like, taste a bit of the blood drip like young pups?"

"yep, i remember," he replied.

"same play applies, i said, to every hustle—lessons, workouts, even dangerous vibes—and whoever’s most chill in all of them gets bumped to the elite crew."

"at what age tho?" he asked.

"at the point when the essential gym time is done—like that 2-3 year training period which is basically useless for any other flex; cuz sleep and workouts don’t really mix with deep learning—and the showdown of who’s first in the gym is one of the dopest tests our youth face," i explained.

"definitely," he replied.

"after that, the chosen 20-year-olds get leveled up to higher honor, and all the random sciences they picked up in early chaos merge, letting them peep how everything’s connected and aligned with true being."

"yep, that’s the only kind of knowledge that sticks," he said.

"yes, and that ability to soak up this kind of knowledge is the ultimate flex of dialectical talent—a broad, all-encompassing mind is always the dialectical mind."

"i agree with you," he said.

"so these are the vibes you gotta weigh up; and those who seriously get it, who are the most consistent in their learning, and who slay in military and other key gigs, by the age of thirty should be plucked from the elite crew and leveled up. then, you gotta test them with dialectic to see which one can ditch basic sight and senses altogether, squad up with truth, and hit absolute being. and here, my dude, you gotta be mega cautious."

"why mega caution?" he asked.

"don’t you see how massive the chaos dialectic has stirred up?" i pressed.

"what chaos?" he asked.

"the students of this art are straight-up wildin’ with lawlessness," i said.

"for real," he agreed.

"so, do you think there’s anything so extra, so inexcusable about their vibe? or you gonna let it slide?"

"in what way, let it slide?" he asked.



yo, i want you, i said, on a parallel vibe, to peep this imaginary son raised in crazy baller wealth; he’s from a massive fam and his timeline’s flooded with bootlickers. when he levels up to grown man mode, he finds out that the folks he thought were his ride-or-die crew are actually sus AF fake news – and the legit ones? total mystery, like a secret drop with no clues. so, can u vibe out how he’ll act toward his clout-chasing simp squad and his pseudo fam—first when he’s still oblivious to the epic fraud, and then after the tea’s spilled? or shall i drop the deets for you?

if you please.

i’d say, while he’s still living in oblivion, he’s gonna flex mad respect for his dad, mom, and that so-called fam way more than for all those bootlickers; he won’t ghost or throw shade at them when they need him, and he’ll def not diss them over any big deal.

for sure, he will.

but once he peels back the truth, i’m betting his respect for his fake fam will nosedive, and he’ll go hard for the bootlickers instead; their clout on him will skyrocket, and he’ll start straight-up living by their playbook—chilling with them open and all, and unless his vibe is extraordinarily lit, he won’t stress over those pseudo-parents anymore.

fr fr, that seems mad likely. but how does this tea drop on the philosophy squad?

look, it’s like we were schooled on OG vibes like justice and honor from day one, raised under that parental authority, obeying and honoring those core maxims.

facts.

plus, there’s this other squad of wild maxims and pleasure habits that try to flex on your soul, but they don’t even phase someone who’s on that right-path vibe—we keep it 100 with the values our old-school fam taught us.

true that.

so, when a dude’s in that state, and his inner skeptic starts asking “what’s actually fair or honorable?” and he spouts the legislator’s old-school lines, then a crazy remix of arguments comes at him from every angle, wrecking his vibe until he ends up thinking nothing’s really honorable versus dishonorable, or just versus bad—even all the ideas he used to stan get flipped on him. u think he’ll still ride or die for those values like before?

impossible, fam.

and once he’s over it and no longer sees them as naturally rad, and he can’t even peep what’s true, can we really expect him to chase any life apart from the one that just flatters his own craving for vibes? 

he cannot.

and so, from playing the lawkeeper, he straight-up transforms into a lawbreaker?

unquestionably, bet.

so all this is hella natural for philosophy peeps like i described, and like i just dropped, it’s totally excusable.

yea, he said—and honestly, kinda triggering pity.

so, to keep u from getting all mushy over our 30-year-old citizens, we’ve gotta be extra cautious when sliding them into dialectic.

for sure.

there’s a risk they might catch that sweet delight way too early; cuz, as u’ve prolly seen, when newbies first get a taste, they start arguing just for clout, always clapping back and contradicting others like it’s a meme battle—like little puppy-dogs hyped on pulling and tearing at anything that comes near.

yea, no cap, that’s literally their fave move.

and once they rack up mad wins and epic fails, they flip their whole belief system on the spot, so not only do they get all shook, but philosophy itself ends up getting a sus rep everywhere.

too true, fr.

but when a dude levels up in age, he won’t be that extra wild anymore; he’ll start vibing like a proper truth-seeking dialectician instead of a clown eristic just dissing for giggles, and his overall cooler, more balanced character will actually boost the honor of his pursuit.

very true, bet.

and didn’t we lock in that philosophy disciples gotta be on point and ride or die, not just any random wannabe or intruder crashing the party?

facts.

so, suppose i drop that studying philosophy replaces gym class, and we grind on it full send for double the number of years you’d normally sweat it out—u reckon that’s enough?

“you think six or four years?” he asked.

i’m like, “nah, five years,” i replied; and when that timer’s up, they gotta be sent back into the den, forced to snag any military or other gig that a young buck qualifies for—so they grind out real-life xp and get tested on whether, when tempted in all sorts of wild ways, they hold it down or yeet out.

and how long is this whole phase gonna last?

fifteen years, i answered; and once these legends hit fifty, then let those still kicking and who’ve flexed in every move of life and every field of knowledge finally hit their peak: the moment drops when they gotta lift their soul goggles to the universal light that levels up all things, and peep the absolute good. that’s the blueprint for how they’re gonna order the state and drop rules on individual lives for the rest of their days—making philosophy their main hustle, but when it’s their turn, they also grind in politics and rule for the common squad, not like they’re on some epic heroic quest, just doing it out of straight-up duty. and when they’ve raised a posse of mini icons in every generation to keep the state on lock, they’ll yeet off to the islands of the blest to chill forever; and the city will drop public memorials, sacrifices, and mad props on them—if the pythian oracle gives a thumbs up, they get hailed as demigods, otherwise, they’re still forever blessed and divine.

bro, you’re a dope sculptor, socrates, and you’ve carved our governors into statues that are major aesthetic goals.

yep, i said, glaucon, and our queens too; cuz u gotta know, my vibe isn’t just for dudes, but for women as well, all in their true essence.

deadass, he said, since we made them vibe equal in all things, just like the guys.

alright, i said, and u’d agree, right? that everything said about the state and government isn’t just some wishful dream—it’s tough but not impossible, only possible in the way we pictured; that is, when true philosopher kings are born into a state, one or more of them, totally dissing the lame honors of this sus present world they see as trash, holding what’s right and the honor that flows from it as the ultimate flex, and treating justice as the top-tier essential, will rise up as their ministers and exalt these principles when they lay out the city’s order.

so, how they gonna roll?

they’ll kick off by sending out into the countryside every homie from the city over ten years old, scooping up all the kiddos (who haven’t yet caught the shady vibes of their parents) and schooling them on a fresh set of habits and our own solid laws—i mean, the rules we laid down. this way, the state and constitution we’re hyping will hit that happiness level super fast, and the nation rocking that setup will totally come out on top.

facts, that’s the ultimate plan. and i think, socrates, u totally nailed the deets on how such a constitution might ever drop.

alright, that's enough on the perfect state and its vibe mirror—it's hella obvious how we’re gonna paint its homie.

no cap, he replied; and i’m with u that nothing more needs to be spilled.

book viii.

so, glaucon, we’ve landed on the idea that in the perfect state, the wifely squad and kiddos are all shared out; and that all education, along with the hustle of war and peace, is communal—with the dopest philosophers and the bravest warriors ruling as kings?

that, glaucon replied, is already a given.

yep, i said; and we also agreed that when the govern squad is crowned, they roll out their soldiers and plug them into living digs like we described—totally communal, with zero private flex—and about their property, remember what we decided?

yeah, i recall: no one’s allowed those basic human property vibes; they’re gonna be warrior-athlete guardians, getting from the citizens just enough maintenance instead of big annual payouts, and they gotta handle themselves and the whole state.

facts, i said; and now that we’ve split our agenda, let’s circle back to where we left off, so we can get back on the OG track.

coming back is easy—you hinted then, as now, that u had wrapped up the state deets: u said that such a state was lit, and that the guy who vibes with it is dope, though, as it turns out, u had even cooler heat to drop about both the state and the man. and u even said that if this is the real vibe, then all other forms are fake; and among the fakes, u mentioned, if i remember right, that there are four main types, with flaws in both the systems and the dudes running them that are totally worth a deep dive. after scoping all the individuals, and finally agreeing on who’s the goated and who’s trash, we were gonna compare whether the goated one is also the happiest, and the trashiest the most miserable. i asked u about these four government forms, then polemarchus and adeimantus chimed in, and u got back on track to the point we’re at now.

your recall is on point, i said.

then, like a boss wrestler, he replied, “u gotta jump back in that zone; let me drop the same q’s and see if u still hit me with the same fire u were about to drop back then.”

“yes, if i can, i will,” i said.

i’m super keen to peep what the four constitutions u were dissing are.

that question, i said, is an easy drip: the four governments with distinct names are, first, those of crete and sparta—the OG vibes everyone claps for; next up is oligarchy, which isn’t the crowd favorite and is loaded with shady evils; third is democracy, which naturally pops off after oligarchy but on an entirely diff energy; and lastly, the ultimate trash-tier: tyranny, famous for being hella different and the worst disorder in a state. i dunno, u feel me? is there any other constitution that’s got its distinct drip? sure, there are lordships and principalities that get traded around, and some mid-way forms, but those are bland and pop up equally among hellenes and barbarians.

yea, he replied—we straight up hear about a bunch of wild government styles from them.

u know, i said, that governments flip just like people’s vibes vary—and that there gotta be as many state styles as there are human dispositions. we can’t assume states are just built out of cold “oak and rock” without that raw human juice influencing everything, tilting the scales and dragging extra traits along.

yea, he said, states are literally as the peeps are—they grow straight from human characters.

so, if the constitutions of states number five, then the different individual mind vibes also break into five?

certainly.

the one who vibes with aristocracy—and whom we rightly call just and good—has already been described.

we have.

then let’s roll into dishing on the lower-tier vibes: the contentious, ambitious types rolling with the spartan energy; plus the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical crews. let’s line up the most just against the most unjust so we can scope which life is actually lit—the life of pure justice versus that of straight-up injustice misery. then our Q is answered, and we know if we should chase injustice, like thrasymachus suggests, or stick with justice as our convo’s conclusion.

for sure, he replied, we gotta do it that way.

shall we stick to our OG plan for clarity—first breaking down the state, then diving into the individual—starting with the government of honor? i mean, i can’t think of another name for that vibe besides timocracy (or maybe timarchy). then we’ll flex by comparing that same energy in the individual; after that, we’ll map out oligarchy and the oligarchical dude; next, we’ll peep democracy and its corresponding vibe; and lastly, we’ll scope out the city of tyranny, dive into the tyrant’s soul, and drop a verdict that actually makes sense.

that method for vibing on and judging the matter is totally on point.

first off, i said, let’s dig into how timocracy (that honor-based government) pops off from aristocracy (the rule of the best). clearly, all political shake-ups start from splits in the actual governing power—a squad that’s united, no matter how small, just can’t be moved.

deadass, he said.

so, how exactly is our city gonna get stirred up, and in what way will the two crews—the auxiliaries and the rulers—clash with each other? should we, homer-style, hit up the muses and ask ‘how did discord first go down?’ should we picture them roasting us like we’re kids, dropping epic tragic vibes while pretending to be all serious?

how would they even drop that address?

here’s how they’d spit it: a city built like this is hella stable, but yo, since every beginning’s got its end, even a dope constitution like yours won’t last forever—it’ll eventually get clapped and break apart. and here’s the lowdown: just like plants growing in the dirt and animals flexing on the ground, the vibes of fertility versus barrenness hit hard when the circle’s complete—short-lived lives wrap up fast, and long-lived ones take way longer. but no matter how much wisdom or schooling your rulers snag, they can’t fully decode the crazy human juice of being fertile or not; the laws that run that show are always just outta reach, and they’ll end up popping off kiddos when they really shouldn’t. now, stuff that’s divinely birthed vibes on a perfect number—think of a cyclical number like 6 (which equals the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3, so when the cycle of 6 is done, the mini rotations of 1, 2, and 3 are wrapped up too)—but human birth rhythms are calculated in a number that evolves with squared and cubed moves, splitting into three intervals and four segments—numbers waxing and waning so all pieces sync up. (probably the numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6, where the first three form the sides of the pythagorean triangle; then you get 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, which together equal 6 cubed, or 216). the base number 3, plus adding a one-third to make 4, when mixed with 5 (totaling 20) and then cubed, gives two harmonies: the first, a square that’s a hundred times as big (400 = 4 × 100) (or a 100 × 100 square equal to 10,000, making the whole number 17,500—a square of 100 and an oblong of 100 by 75), and the other, a shape with one side matching the first but oblong, formed of a hundred numbers squared on rational diameters of a square (skipping fractions), with the side being 5 (like 7 × 7 = 49 × 100 = 4900), each off by one (compared to the perfect square including fractions, roughly 50) or less by (or “made of two numbers squared on irrational diameters,” etc. = 100—see the introduction for more tea) two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square with side 5 = 50 + 50 = 100); plus a hundred cubes of three (27 × 100 = 2700, and then add 4900 + 400 to hit 8000). now, this beast of a number is like a geometric cheat code that controls the good and bad in births. cuz when your guardians are clueless about the law of births and hook up bridezillas and grooms outta season, the kiddos come out all kinds of off—neither fresh nor lucky. and even if only the top-tier get picked by their elders, they still won’t be worthy of filling their dads’ shoes; and once they scoop up the guardian gig, it won’t be long before they flunk at keeping us, the muses, on point—starting by lowkey dissing music, which then spills over to gym class, leaving the youth of your state far less cultured. in the next generation, new rulers will pop up who’ve lost that guardian vibe of testing the metal of your mixed races—which, like hesiod’s breakdown, come in gold, silver, brass, and iron. and soon enough, iron gets mixed with silver, brass with gold, sparking dissimilarity, inequality, and a total irregular mess, which is always the lowkey fuel for hate and war. the muses are all like, “that’s the OG sauce from which all discord has bubbled up, no matter where you look,” and that’s their drop to us.

facts, and we can assume they’re spitting straight truth.

why, yes, i said—duh, of course they’re real; how can the muses ever cap?

so, what’s the next tea from the muses?

they say that when discord hit, the two crews got split: the iron and brass types went all out hustling for money, land, houses, gold, and silver; while the gold and silver crew, not chasing cash but already packing true inner riches, leaned into virtue and that old-school order. there was an epic showdown between them, and finally they agreed to divvy up the land and houses into individual chunks; plus, they flipped the script on their own homies—those friends and protectors they once kept free—turning them into subjects and servants, all while they themselves stayed busy waging war and keeping vigilant against any heat.

i feel like u totally caught the origin of the switch-up.

so, this new government that drops—will it be a hybrid between oligarchy and aristocracy?

deadass true.

that’s the switch—and once the change is locked in, what next? obviously, the new state, chillin’ in between oligarchy and the perfect state, will be like a hybrid: picking up moves from both while throwing in some offbeat quirks.

true, he said.

in how much the rulers get honored, in the way the warrior squad chills out from basic farming, handicrafts, or trading, in that whole scene of communal meals, and in the mad focus on gym workouts and military drills—the new state will have mad throwback vibes to the OG style.

facts.

but then, there’s that extra twist: they get shook by the fear of letting philosophers take the reins, ‘cause these peeps aren’t coming through all pure and simple anymore—they’re now a mix of vibes; and that shift moves them toward more hot-headed, less layered types, naturally built more for brawls than for peace; plus, they’ll be all about military stratagems and constant wars—making this state hella offbeat and unique.

yea.

so there it is.

yeah, i said; and dudes of this vibe are gonna be mad thirsty for that paper, just like the oligarch crowd; they’ll have that savage, secret flex for gold and silver, stashing their loot in sketchy spots, with their own drip magazines and secret treasuries for hiding the bag; and oh, they’ll cop castles that are basically just cribs for their eggs, where they blow stacks on their bae or any other squad they vibe with.

that’s legit true, he said.

and they're hella stingy 'cause they can't just flex open ways to bag their coin; they'll blow someone else's currency to feed their wild cravings, snatch their vibes, and yeet away like kids dodging daddy's rulebook. they've been schooled on hardcore force, ghosting that real muse of reason and philosophy, while flexing hard on gym grind over chill tunes.

undoubtedly, he said, the government you're outlining is basically a remix of good vibes and shady moves.

yup, there's a dope mix, i said; but there's literally one vibe that's extra prominent—the vibe of hella flexing and drama; and that's straight up thanks to that blazing passionate energy.

facts, he said.

so, which type of dude vibes with this style of gov—like, how did he level up, and what's his drip like?

i think, said adeimantus, that with all that tussle energy he rocks, he's lowkey like our homie glaucon.

maybe, i said, he's similar on that one flex; but on other deets, he's totally on a different meme.

in what ways, tho?

he should be all about self-confidence, less highbrow and bookish, yet still a cultural homie; he’s gonna be a top-tier listener without being a chatterbox. this type tends to be rough on his underlings—unlike the super educated who are too extra for that—and he’s polite to the freemen, lowkey obedient to the big bosses. he’s all about power and honor, claiming the ruler title not 'cause he's got mad eloquence, but 'cause he's a soldier out here flexing real battle feats; plus, he's down for gym sesh and chasing the thrill of the hunt.

exactly, that's the type that vibes with timocracy.

this dude will scoff at riches when he's young; but as he levels up, he'll get lowkey obsessed with stacking paper, 'cause a slice of that greedy vibe’s deep inside him, and he ain't fully locked on virtue, having ghosted his top muse.

who was that? asked adeimantus.

philosophy, i said, spiced up with music that slides into a man's soul and stands as the sole lifesaver for his virtue on the daily.

good, he said.

yup, i said, that's the timocratic youth – totally the mirror image of the timocratic state.

exactly.

his origin goes down like this: he's usually the young kid of a brave af father, living in a city that's totally sus and mismanaged. the old dude declines honors and offices, dodges court drama, and is ready to dip on his rights just to avoid any beef.

and how does the son level up?

the kid's vibe starts evolving when he hears his mom griping that her man has zero clout in the gov game, which leaves her with no rep among the lady squad. then she sees him not hyped for stacking coins—choosing to ride the waves in court or assembly with chill vibes instead—and notices his brain's always on his own flex while he straight up ghosts her. she gets major sus and tells her son that his dad is like only half a real man and way too laid-back, dropping all that extra tea about her suffering that women love to spill.

yeah, said adeimantus, they serve up mad tea, and their whining is total self-reflection.

and, yo, i said, the old servants, supposed to be tight with the fam, sometimes slide into one-on-one chats with the kid; and if they peep anyone who owes coin to his dad or is lowkey jacking him, and the dad ain't calling them out, they straight up tell the kid that when he levels up, he's gotta clap back on those types and be a real man—more so than his old man. he only needs to step out and he'll see the same drama everywhere: those doing their own hustle in the city get labeled as noobs, while the nosy ones get mad props. so, soaking all that in—along with his dad's own words and close-up lifestyle comparisons—he's pulled in as many directions; while his dad's watering that rational vibe in his soul, the rest are hyping up the wild, passionate, and hungry juices. since the kid wasn’t originally a bad egg but rolled with sketchy peeps, their combined influence eventually drags him to the middle, letting that beef and passion vibe rule his inner kingdom, turning him straight-up arrogant and extra.

yo, you just described his starting kit perfectly.

so now, i said, are we looking at the second form of gov and the next character archetype?

we do.

next, let's check out another dude who, as aeschylus says, "is set over against another state;" or, per our plan, let's start with the state.

all good.

i'm thinking oligarchy is next on deck.

so, what swag of gov do you label oligarchy?

it's a gov all about that property drip, where the rich run the show and the broke get totally ghosted.

i feel that, he replied.

shouldn't i first break down how timocracy morphs into oligarchy?

yep.

well, i said, you literally don't need a magnifying glass to see how one transitions into the other.

how so?

stacking up gold in private vaults spells doom for timocracy; they start cooking up shady hustle moves to drop cash, since like, why would they or their bae ever care about the law?

for sure.

and then, when one sees his homie get rich, he jumps in to level up, so the majority become total money junkies.

big facts.

so they keep stacking while virtue gets left on read; on the balance, as one goes up, the other takes a nosedive.

true af.

and the more the state hypes the rich, the more virtue and the righteous get totally dissed.

clearly.

and those clout-worthy get groomed, while what doesn't get the hype just gets ghosted.

that's straight-up obvious.

and so eventually, instead of vibing on conflict and glory, dudes swap it for the hustle of trade and cash; they hype up the rich, anointing them as rulers, while dissing the broke.

exactly.

next up, they draft a law setting a coin threshold for citizenship – with the bar varyin' by spot, based on how exclusive the oligarchy is – and anyone with less stash than the set amount gets totally excluded from ruling. these constitution tweaks are enforced by straight-up force, if not pure intimidation.

very true.

and so, in a nutshell, that's how the whole oligarchy vibe gets established.

yeah, he said; but what are the key deets of this gov form, and what are its major flaws we were talking about?

first up, i said, consider the coin qualification. imagine if pilots were picked based solely on their bank, and a broke dude got benched, even if he was a far better flyer?

mean, they'd totally crash, right?

yep, and isn't that a fact of any form of gov?

i can vibe with that.

except maybe a city? or does that roll too?

nah, he said, running a city is the ultimate grind – the toughest, highest stakes of 'em all.

so, that's the first major glitch of oligarchy, right?

clearly.

and here's another major flaw, just as sus:

what's the flaw?

the unavoidable split, man: this state ain't one, it's like two separate squads – one for the broke and one for the rich – both chillin' in the same hood and constantly scheming against each other.

no cap, that's at least as messed up.

another major bummer is that, for similar reasons, they're totally incapable of waging war. either they arm the mob and get more shook by their own peeps than the enemy, or if they keep the masses benched, then they're just an oligarchy with too few fighters to match their few rulers. plus, their mad love for cash makes them dodge taxes like it's an awkward question.

so cringe, right?

and as we already dropped, in this system the same peeps wear a million hats—farming, hustling, and soldiering all at once. does that even look fire?

no cap, that's a hot mess.

there's another massive evil, probably the worst of them all, that this state is doomed to right from the jump.

what's the evil, fam?

a guy might offload all his gear and someone else snags his stash; yet after selling, he remains stuck in the city – not as a merchant, craftsman, horseman, or soldier, but just a straight-up poor, helpless dude.

yup, that's the kind of evil that kicks off right here.

clearly, this evil doesn't get nipped in the bud, since oligarchies serve up both mega rich flex and complete pauper grind.

true.

but check it: back in his wealthy days, when he was droppin' mad cash, did this guy truly add legit value as a citizen for the state? or did he only appear to be part of the ruling squad, even though deep down he was just a junky spender?

exactly, he came off as a ruler, but in reality he was just a spendthrift.

aren't we just calling this dude the freeloader drone of the house, kinda like the buzzing drone in a honeycomb – where one is a curse to the city just as the drone is to the hive?

exactly, socrates.

and god's out here making flying drones, all stingless, while for the walking drones, some are stingless and others pack mad toxic stings; the stingless ones end up as paupers in old age, and the stingers turn into the whole criminal crew.

most true, he said.

so, whenever you peep paupers in any state, you can bet there are hidden-away scammers, pickpockets, temple robbers, and all kinds of lowlife troublemakers lurking around.

clearly.

so, i said, in oligarchical states, don't you always see paupers?

yes, he said; literally, anyone who isn't ruling is a pauper.

and can we be bold enough to say that these states also house a ton of criminals, rogues with stings, who the authorities are forced to rein in by brute force?

certainly, we can be so bold.

the presence of these clowns is totally due to a lack of proper education, bad training, and a shady state constitution, right?

true.

so, that's the structure and the evils of oligarchy; and trust, there are plenty more rotten issues lurking.

very likely.

so, oligarchy—the gov where the coin-rich are elected—can be dismissed. next, let's dive into the nature and origin of the person who vibes with this state.

by all means.

doesn't the timocratic man morph into the oligarch one like this?

how so?

eventually, a timocratic dude gets a son: at first, the kid copies his dad's moves, but then he sees his old man suddenly tanking against the state like he hit a reef, losing everything; maybe he was a general or a high-level boss who got dragged into a trial because of haters, and ended up either executed, exiled, or stripped of his citizen status while his assets got snatched.

nothing could be more on point.

so, having witnessed all that, the son is totally wrecked, and his fear teaches him to boot ambition and passion off his inner throne; humiliated by poverty, he jumps into hustling for cash, stacking up every penny through miserly saving and hard grind until he pulls together a fortune. ain't that prime for letting the mad craving for loot crown itself as the inner king, kitted out in a crown, chain, and scimitar?

most true, he replied.

and once he's got reason and spirit chilling obediently on each side of his inner boss, taught to stick to their lane, he forces one to only focus on flipping small coin into big stacks while not letting the other vibe with anything but cash and rich peeps, nor be hype about any goal other than amassing wealth and the means to grab it.

of all transitions, he said, there's no quicker or more guaranteed flip than turning that ambitious youth into a hardcore greedster.

and so, i said, the money-hungry one is basically the oligarchical youth, right?

yes, he said; basically, the og dude he evolved from is just like the state that birthed oligarchy.

let's peep if they're really on the same wavelength.

very good.

first, they both are all in on that coin-money grind.

certainly.

also, they got that scrappy, hustling vibe; the guy only satisfies his basic cravings and only drops coin on essentials, crushing all extra desires as unprofitable.

true.

he's a scruffy dude, always snagging a bit from everything to fatten his wallet; that's exactly the kind of guy that the normies hype up. isn't he the perfect image of the state he's representing?

he sure does; after all, money is a major flex for him, just like it is for the state.

you see, he's not the cultured type, i said.

i imagine not, he said; if he had any real education, he would've never crowned some clueless god as the boss of his crew or dished out top honors like that.

excellent, i said. but, for real, consider this: doesn't his lack of culture bring out those lowkey drone-level cravings, like those of paupers and rogues, which he only keeps down with his everyday grind?

true.

do you know where you'll have to peep if you wanna uncover his shady antics?

where must i look, fam?

you should scope him out when he's got a big chance to act sketchy – like when he's in charge of an orphan's guardianship.

aye.

it'll be clear af that in his regular hustle, which scores him a rep for being on the up and up, he keeps his sketchy desires in check not by schooling them with reason but by strict discipline and fear—'cause he's always shook about losing his stash.

to be sure.

yeah, for real, my dear friend, you'll notice those natural drone vibes are always lurking in him whenever he's droppin' cash that's not his own.

yes, and they'll be mad strong in him too.

so, the dude ends up at war with himself—like, he's two men in one; but generally, his better vibes come out on top over his weak ones.

true.

so because of that, he might seem more respectable than most, but the real vibe of a united, harmonious soul will be totally absent and never roll with him.

i'd expect that.

and surely, the miser is a cringe competitor for any glory prize or honorable hustle; he won't drop coin on the contest for fame, too shook of unleashing his pricey cravings to join the fight; oligarch-style, he only plays with a tiny slice of his dough, which usually means he misses out on the win while keeping his money safe.

very true.

can we even doubt that the miser-money-maker is the perfect rep for the oligarchical state?

there's zero doubt.

next, we got democracy; we haven't yet dived into its origin and vibe, and then we'll check out the ways of the democratic dude and call him out.

that, he said, is how we roll.

so, i said, how does the shift from oligarchy to democracy happen? isn't it that the state's main flex is to get as loaded as possible—an appetite that's never satisfied?

what then?

the rulers, knowing their power rides on their wealth, straight up refuse to legally curb the wild spending of the spendthrift youth because they profit off his ruin; they scoop up interest and buy up his estates, boosting their own wealth and rep.

to be sure.

there's zero doubt that mad love for cash and a chill moderation vibe can't roll together in one state's citizens—one is always gonna be left out.

that's pretty clear.

and in oligarch states, with all the careless excess, even the dudes from solid families end up reduced to beggars.

yes, often.

and yet, they're stuck in the city; there they are, armed and ready to sting—some owing mad coin, some stripped of citizenship; a whole third batch is caught in both traps; and they end up hating and scheming against those with property—and everyone else—buzzing for a full-on revolution.

that is true.

on the flip side, business peeps, stooping low and pretending not to see the wreckage they caused, slide their cash sting into some unsuspecting fool, and then scoop up their original sum, multiplying it into a legacy through a family—and so they churn out drones and paupers in the state.

yes, he said, there's plenty of them—that's for sure.

the evil ignites like a blazing fire; and they won’t put it out, neither by restricting a man's own property nor with any other fix:

what other solution?

the next best remedy, with the bonus of pushing citizens to check their own character: let there be a general law that everyone enters voluntary contracts at their own risk, and then the shady money-making and evils we mentioned will drop mad low in the state.

yes, they would be greatly slashed.

currently, the governors, fueled by these motives, treat their subjects poorly; and they and their squad, especially the young ruling class, are too used to a life of luxury and idleness—doing nothing and unable to fight back against pleasure or pain.

very true.

they're only out here to stack cash and couldn't care less about cultivating virtue, just like paupers.

yes, completely indifferent.

such is the state of affairs among them, fr. often the rulers and their squad cross paths—whether on a road trip, random meetup, pilgrimage, or even a march, vibing as fellow soldiers or fellow sailors; and yo, they might catch each other mid-drama when danger's lit—'cause where there's danger, the broke peeps ain't getting dissed by the rich flexers—and deadass, you might see that wiry, sunburnt poor dude getting strapped in battle right next to a rich homie who’s never even gotten roasted and is packing extra flesh—when he peeps this dude completely gasping and maxed out, how can he not peep that guys like him are rich only 'cause nobody's got the guts to snatch their swag? and when they kick it one-on-one, ain't folks gonna be throwing shade like, “our warriors ain't all that”?

yeah, he said, i'm totes aware that's literally how they chat.

and just like a sick body where even a tiny extra touch can mess things up, sometimes—no external tea even required—mad drama pops off from within. same vibe in any weak-ass state: even a slight trigger, with one squad throwing in their oligarch flex from the outside and the other sliding in their democrat crew, sends the state into a self-sabotaging brawl; sometimes it even goes off on a tangent with zero external inspo.

yes, for sure.

then democracy drops in on the scene when the broke squad straight up claps their haters—some get yeeted, others exiled—while the rest get an equal slice of freedom and power; and this is the type of government where the magistrates are basically picked by drawing straws, no cap.

yeah, he said, that's democracy's vibe—whether the revolution's gone full-on with the claps or the opposition bailed out straight-up out of fear.

so, yo, what's their daily drip and which kind of government they rockin'? 'cause the state shapes the dude.

obviously, he said.

first up, ain't they all just free af? ain't the city bursting with mad freedom and no-cap honesty—where a dude can spit and do whatever he wants?

yup, that's what they say, he replied.

and where there's freedom, a person can totally boss up their own life, right?

for sure.

so in that kind of state, we're gonna see the wildest mix of peeps, correct?

for sure.

so basically, this is likely the most lit state, like an embroidered drip-fit all spangled with every sort of flower. and just like women and kiddos are all about a variegated color palette, there are lots of dudes who see this state—with all the human vibes and quirks sprinkled on it—as the ultimate aesthetic, the fairest of them all.

yep.

yeah, my good sir, there's no better spot to scoop a government.

why tho?

'cause the liberty there is on fleek—they got a full assortment of constitutions, like different flavors on deck; and if you wanna build your own state, you gotta slide into a democracy like you're hitting up a bazaar, pick out the one that vibes with you, and then—bam!—found your own kingdom.

you can bet there's a whole squad of patterns to choose from.

and btw, i said, there's zero pressure for you to boss it up in this state, even if you're mad capable, or to be governed, unless it's your jam—like, you don't have to join the war squad when everyone else is fighting, or chill in peace when others are at ease—unless you're feelin' it. there's literally no rule saying you gotta hold office or be a decision-maker if you've got a fancy. isn't this lifestyle right now just hella awesome?

for now, yeah.

and ain't it mad cute how their vibes with the condemned sometimes come off as pretty charming? haven't you peeped how in a democracy, plenty of folks—even if they're sentenced to do the ultimate exit or exile—just chill where they are and cruise the world, with the dude strutting like a legit hero while nobody even bats an eye?

yeah, he replied, like a ton.

look, i said, democracy's all about that chill, forgiving vibe—so chill that she doesn't sweat the petty tea and straight-up ignores all our high-key ideals we set when we founded the city. remember when we said that, except for one of those rare gifted peeps, no good dude ever grows up without vibing with beauty and turning it into joy and a study? well, she tramples all that classy stuff under her kicks, never giving a thought to the pursuits that make a true statesman, and hyping up anyone who claims to be the people's ride-or-die.

yeah, she’s on that noble flex.

all these vibes and other similar quirks are totally democracy’s signature—a charming form of government that's wild with variety and chaotic as heck, handing out a kind of equality to both the boss level and the underdogs alike.

we stan her, fr.

now peep this, i said: what type of dude is the individual? or, looking at it like the state, how does he even come into being?

solid, he said.

isn't it that he’s basically the spawn of a cheap, oligarch dad who schooled him on his own shady habits?

exactly.

and, just like his old man, he lowkey keeps in check the spending vibes—those pleasures that are all about flashing cash instead of earning it—the ones we call unnecessary, ya dig?

obviously, bet.

for clarity’s sake, you wanna break down which pleasures are essential and which are just extra?

i’m down.

aren't necessary pleasures the ones you just can't ditch, with satisfaction that actually levels you up? they're called necessary 'cause nature built us to crave what’s beneficial and essential—no cap.

true that.

so it's totally legit to label 'em necessary, right?

we are, fr.

and those desires a dude can kick to the curb if he hustles from youth—cravings that bring zero vibe and sometimes straight-up wreck your flow—can we call all that extra stuff unnecessary?

yes, certainly, no cap.

suppose we pull an example of each, so we can really peep what they're about?

bet, that's lit.

isn't that hunger for basic grub and condiments—the ones needed for health and strength—a necessary flex?

that's exactly what i’d say.

the joy of munching is necessary twofold; it boosts our vibe and keeps the life train rolling.

yes, for sure.

but those condiments? they're only necessary if they're actually good for your health, right?

certainly.

and that extra flex for gourmet treats or other luxuries—stuff you could totally yeet if you trained yourself early on and that messes with your bod and kills your soul’s vibe for wisdom and virtue—is straight-up unnecessary.

very true, no cap.

can we say that those extra cravings just drain your coin, while the essential ones help you level up and produce real benefits?

certainly.

and for the love vibes and all the other pleasures, same deal, right?

true, no cap.

and that drone we mentioned? the dude who gets totally drowned in extra, unnecessary cravings—basically a slave to that extra hype—while the one who sticks to just the essentials stays all oligarch and tightwad.

very true, fr.

again, let's peep how a democratic dude emerges from that oligarch hustle—the process is kinda like a glow-up.

so what’s the process then?

when a young dude, raised in that basic and miserly style we just laid out, gets his first taste of drone’s honey and starts chilling with some savage, slick peeps who can hook him up with all sorts of refined pleasures, then—obviously—the oligarch vibes in him start flipping into full-on democratic mode.

inevitably, fr.

and just like in the city where like attracts like, with external alliances boosting one squad, the young dude gets switched up by a wave of outside cravings that hype up his inner vibes, kinda linking similar energies to boost one another.

certainty, bet.

and if any squad—like his dad or fam—adds fuel to his oligarch side, whether by hyping or throwing shade, then his soul splits into two crews that end up clashing hard.

yup, it has to be.

and sometimes the democratic vibe gives way to that oligarch flex—some of his cravings dip or even get booted out; then a vibe of mad respect slides into his soul and order is briefly restored.

yes, he said, that really happens sometimes.

and then, once the old cravings are yeeted, fresh ones pop up that are like mini-me versions, and since their OG doesn't know how to school them right, they go savage and multiply.

yes, he said, that's totally how it goes.

they pull him back to his old crew, getting all secret vibes with him, and boom—they multiply inside his persona.

very true, no cap.

eventually, they snatch up the citadel of his soul—a place that, sadly, is void of legit achievements, solid pursuits, and real talk that normally lives in the minds of peeps loved by the gods and who serve as their ultimate guardians.

no one better.

and fake flexes and clout-chasing catchphrases start stacking up to take over.

they're gonna do that, no doubt.

so the young dude ends up retreating to the lotus-eaters' zone, setting up camp right in front of everyone's eyes; and if his homies try sending support to his oligarch side, those same bogus vibes slam the gate of his kingly crib—blocking any official counsel or even private advice from the wise OGs. there's an all-out internal brawl, they clinch the victory, and then modesty—dubbed “silliness”—gets brutally exiled, while temperance—mocked as “unmanliness”—is trampled in the mud and tossed out; they hype it up that moderation and smart spending are just basic and lame, so with a rabble of shady appetites, they boot those principles beyond the border.

yep, for sure.

and once they've totally cleaned out the soul of the dude now under their control, initiating him into their wild mysteries, the next move is to flood his space with straight-up insolence, anarchy, waste, and raw impudence—flaring up in bright arrays with garlands on their heads and a massive squad chanting his praises and slinging sweet nicknames. they call insolence “breeding,” anarchy “liberty,” waste “magnificence,” and impudence “courage.” and so the young dude peaces out from his original, necessity-trained vibe and dives headfirst into the freedom and debauchery of useless, extra pleasures.

yes, he said, you can totally peep that transformation.

after that, he just keeps vibing—blowing his coin, energy, and time on extra pleasures just as much as on the essentials; but if he’s lucky and not too cray in his head, when years pass and the wild passion era fades—assuming he even invites back some exiled virtues into his life and doesn’t totally surrender to the next-gen vibes—then he manages to balance his pleasures and lives in a kind of equilibrium, handing over control of his life to whoever wins the first round; and when he's had his fill, he passes the reins to someone else—disrespecting none and hyping them all equally.

very true, he said.

and he won't take, nor let into his inner fortress, any legit advice; if anyone tries to school him that some pleasures are the satisfaction of noble, good vibes and others come from shady desires—and that he should cherish some while bossing the others around—every time it’s brought up, he just shakes his head and goes, “they're all the same; one is as dope as the next.”

yes, he said; that's just how he rolls.

yeah, i said, he lives day-to-day riding the vibe of the moment; sometimes he gets totally smashed, vibing on drink and flute jams; then he goes water-only to trim down; hops into a round of gymnastics; sometimes he just chills and ghosts all responsibilities, then flips back into full philosopher mode; often he’s deep in politics, suddenly jumping up to say and do whatever wild thought hits him; and if he starts flexing like a warrior, off he goes, or if it's business mode, he flips that switch too. his life is pure chaos—no rules, no order—and he calls that distracted hustle joy, bliss, and freedom; and so he just rolls on.

yes, he replied, he's all about that liberty and equality.

yes, i said; his life is mad motley and multifaceted—an epic snapshot of countless living styles. he's basically the living embodiment of that spangled, fair state we described. and tons of dudes and dudettes will see him as their role model, with a whole collection of constitutional flex and manners on deck.

just so.

so, set him against democracy and you got the prototypical democratic man.

let that be his vibe, he said.

lastly, we gotta talk about the most extra of all—for both the man and the state: tyranny and the tyrant; these are up next for consideration.

preach, he said.

so tell me, my friend, how does tyranny even pop off? it's clear that its roots are in democracy.

clearly.

and like, doesn't tyranny vibe off democracy just like democracy did off oligarchy—like, in a similar way?

how tho?

the tea is, the oligarchy was all about flexing mad wealth to keep power—am i right?

yes, no cap.

and that never-satisfied hustle for cash, while totally ghosting everything else, was straight-up the downfall of oligarchy, right?

true.

and democracy’s own vibe, that same endless thirst for more freedom, eventually brings her to the edge of collapse?

what vibe, though?

freedom, i replied; cuz in a democracy, freedom is the ultimate flex of the state—and that’s why only in a democracy does the free spirit truly wanna kick it.

yes; that’s the wave on everyone’s lips.

i was gonna point out that this unquenchable thirst and total neglect of everything else flips democracy on its head, setting up a real demand for tyranny.

how so, tho?

when a democracy, dying for freedom, ends up with sketchy cup-bearers running the party and guzzles too much of that strong freedom wine, then—unless the rulers are super chill and keep the draught coming—she straight up calls them out and punishes them, crowning them as cursed oligarchs.

yes, he replied, that's hella common.

yes, i said; and her loyal peeps get dissed by her own underlings—those clinging to their chains and those with zero clout—she wants subjects who flex like bosses and rulers who are just as chill as the everyday crew: these are the peeps she vibes with and praises both in private and on the streets. now, in a state like that, can liberty even have limits?

definitely not.

gradually, chaos sneaks into private cribs and eventually even spills over to the animals, infecting them with pure anarchy.

what do you mean, tho?

i mean the old dude starts chillin' at his kids' level and even gets shook by them, while the kid ends up on the same wavelength as his pops—with zero respect for either. that's his twisted version of freedom; even the metic is on equal ground with the citizen, and the stranger's just as dope as either.

yes, he said, that's literally how it goes.

and these ain't the only baddies, i said—there are a ton of smaller evils: in such a society, the boss fears and overly flatters his students, while the students straight-up diss their mentors and tutors; young and old basically merge into one vibe; the young are ready to throw down in words or deeds with the old, and the old, too busy being all chipper and jovial, end up mimicking the young's style instead of being morose or bossy.

quite true, he said.

the ultimate level of popular freedom shows up when a money-bought slave—male or female—is just as free as the buyer; and i gotta note the sick equality between the sexes when it comes to freedom.

why not, as aeschylus drops the word that just pops off our lips?

that's exactly what i'm doing, i replied; and i must add, no one clueless would believe just how mega the liberty is for the animals under human rule in a democracy versus any other state: truly, the she-dogs—as the old proverb goes—are as dope as their she-mistresses, and the horses and donkeys strut with all the rights and dignity of freemen; they'll straight-up yeet anyone blocking their path, and everything's practically about to burst with freedom.

when i take a country stroll, he said, i totally catch that vibe. it's like you and i share the same daydream.

and above all, i said, as the final sauce of all this, peep how extra sensitive the citizens become; they get hella triggered by even the smallest hint of authority, and eventually, as you know, they stop caring about laws—written or unwritten—and don't want anyone calling the shots over them.

yes, he said, i know that vibe all too well.

so, my friend, i said, that's the dope, epic kickoff from which tyranny actually sprouts.

glorious indeed, he said. but what's the next step, tho?

the downfall of oligarchy spells the downfall of democracy; it's like the same disease, blown up by too much freedom, that overtakes democracy—the truth is, when anything goes into overdrive, it eventually flips into its opposite. and that's true not just for the seasons or plants and animals, but especially for governments.

true, no doubt.

an overload of liberty—whether in states or in individuals—just ends up flipping into extreme slavery.

yes, that's the natural order.

so tyranny naturally emerges from democracy, and the most extra form of tyranny and slavery shows up when liberty is taken to the max?

just as you'd expect.

but that ain't what you really asked, right? you wanna know what disorder sprouts up in both oligarchy and democracy that ends up being their ultimate downfall.

just so, he replied.

well, i said, i'm talking about that squad of idle spendthrifts—the ones where the braver peeps end up leading while the more scaredy-cats follow—those very ones we compared to drones, some stingless and others packing a sting.

that's a super legit comparison.

these two cliques are like the plague on every city where they pop up, just like phlegm and bile in the body. and the top doc and lawgiver of the state should, like a savvy beekeeper, keep them at arm's length and, if possible, stop them from ever sneaking in; and if they've already crashed the party, he should slice 'em and their hives out as fast as possible.

yes, by all means, he said.

then, to keep it 100 and see our moves, let's imagine democracy chopped into three squads; cuz first up, freedom churns out way more drones in a democracy than in an oligarchy.

that's true, no cap.

and in a democracy, they're totally more extra.

how so, tho?

'cause in an oligarchy, those drones get disqualified and booted from power so they can't level up; whereas in a democracy, they're basically the ruling majority, and while the sharper peeps talk and act, the rest buzz around the bema, not allowing a single dissenting word on the flip side—so in democracies, almost everything is run by the drones.

very true, he said.

then there's another squad that's always getting split off from the main crew.

what's that, tho?

they’re the orderly squad, lowkey the richest ones in a trader hood.  
obviously, no cap.  
  
they’re the most get-squeezable peeps, oozing a swamp load of sweet honey for the drone crew.  
why, he said, there’s barely any juice to squeeze outta folks who got nothing.  
  
and that’s what we call the high-key wealthy crew—and the drones are out here milking them hard.  
that's lowkey the tea, he said.  
  
the people are like a third tier crew, the ones hustling with their own hands; they ain’t politicos and are mad broke sometimes. but when they roll together, they're the biggest, most extra power squad in a democracy.  
true, he said; but yo, the mass squad ain't about vibing unless someone drops a bit of that honey.  
  
and don't they share? i said. don't their top dogs swipe the rich’s estates and spill that drip among the crew, while always clutching the major chunk for themselves?  
why, yup, he said, that's how the squad shares it out.  
  
and those peeps who get jacked of their stash are forced to throw down a defense before the crowd, doing their best—what else can they do?  
  
and then, even if they ain't tryna remix the vibes, the haters claim they’re plotting to mess with the peeps and are basically oligarchy homies.  
facts.  
  
and eventually, when the squad gets peeped—not by their own vibe, but 'cause they're fed up by shady tea from bogus informers trying to front a fast one—they're forced into the oligarch life; not by choice, but the sting of the drones is real and it triggers a wild revolt.  
that's 100% the tea.  
  
then come the wild impeachments, court dramas, and trial feuds.  
facts.  
  
the peeps always rally up a hype beast champion whom they crown and level up into greatness.  
yep, that's how they do it.  
  
this, and no cap, is the root from which a tyrant is born; when he first claps out his presence, he’s all about that protector vibe.  
yeah, crystal clear.  
  
so how does our protector morph into a full-on tyrant? duh—it happens when he starts pulling that wild move from the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus saga.  
what saga, bro?  
  
the scoop is: if one’s ever dipped into the entrails of one homie chopped up with others' guts, bro, he's on track to become a wolf. you never heard that tea?  
oh, bet.  
  
and our people-protector’s on the same path; with a whole mob ready to back him up, he don’t hesitate to off his own kin. using his fave move of bogus charges, he drags them to court and yeets them—making their lives vanish—while his twisted tongue savors his peeps’ blood. some he claps, others he banish-yeets, all while dropping hints about canceling debts and redividing property. and after all that madness, fate’s like: either get rekt by your enemies or flip from human to wolf, i.e., become a straight-up tyrant.  
inevitable, no cap.  
  
i said, that's the same dude who starts a crew against the rich.  
same, bro.  
  
after a hot minute, he gets kicked out, but then he boomerangs back—enemy be damned—as a fully grown tyrant.  
clear af.  
  
and if they can't kick him out or land a public death sentence on him, they end up conspiring to off him.  
yup, he said, that's their typical move.  
  
then up pops the legendary call for a bodyguard—a classic move in every tyrant’s playbook—"let not the people's friend," as they say, "be lost to them."  
facts.  
  
the people are totally cool with it; all their fear is for him—they ain't worried for themselves.  
deadass.  
  
and when a wealthy dude, tagged as a squad enemy, scopes this, then, my dude, just as the oracle dropped to croesus,  
"by pebbly hermus’ shore, he bounces and never catches a break, with zero shame for being a total coward."  
and he was like, "true that," 'cause if he were, he'd be forever drowning in shame.  
  
but if he gets clapped, he dies—obviously.  
  
and our once-protector peep is now the main overthrower, not just "larding the plain" with his bulk, but straight flexin' in the state chariot with reins in hand—ditching the protector vibe for pure, absolute tyrant energy.  
no cap, he said.  
  
and now, let's peep the happiness vibes of the man and the state that spawned a legend like him.  
yeet, he said, let's vibe on that.  
  
in the early glow-up of his power, he’s all smiles—saluting every soul he meets; this tyrant is droppin’ promises in both public streams and DM convos, freeing debtors, dishing out land to the peeps and his inner circle, and flexin’ mega kindness on everyone!  
of course, no cap.  
  
but once he’s yeeted out his foreign foes via war or chill treaties—once there’s zero threat—he always stirs up some fresh war drama just to keep the squad dependent on his leadership.  
for real.  
  
and isn't his other move to slam down mad taxes, leaving the squad broke and hustling just to survive, so they ain't got the clout to rebel?  
obviously.  
  
and if he even suspects someone of catching freedom vibes or resisting his rule, he’s got the perfect excuse to off ’em by handing them over to the enemy; hence, our tyrant is forever cookin’ up a war.  
straight up, he must.  
  
next, he starts losing major street cred—the inevitable clout drop.  
then some of his ride-or-die crew, who helped crown him and still rock power, start throwin’ serious shade and droppin’ the real tea right into his grill.  
obviously, expected vibes.  
  
and if the tyrant’s tryna run the show, he’s got to off anyone—even a friend or an enemy—who’s still lit enough to stir some trouble.  
no cap, he cannot.  
  
therefore, he’s scanning the room for anyone bold, woke, wise, or loaded; dude, he’s automatically the enemy of all that fire energy and must find any chance to roast 'em until he cleans house.  
yeah, he said, and it's a hardcore, rare purge.  
i said, like, not that doctor-style cleanse where you boot the trash and keep the gems; nah, he flips it completely—kicking out the good and hoarding the toxic extras.  
if he wanna rule, i suppose he’s doomed to that glitch, no cap.  
  
what a blessed option, i said—to either be forced to chill only with a bunch of toxic lemmings and get hated for it, or, lowkey, not exist at all!  
yep, that's the only option.  
  
and as his cringey moves get more despised by the peeps, the more extra homies and loyal satellites he must snag, right?  
definitely.  
  
and who exactly are his devoted ride-or-die crew, and where's he gonna scoop 'em up?  
he said, they'll roll up on him on the real if he’s droppin’ cash.  
damn, i said, we're basically talkin' about a crazy swarm of drones from every nook and cranny.  
yes, he said, they are.  
  
but won't he wanna scoop 'em up right on the spot?  
what do you mean, exactly?  
  
he's gonna jack the citizens' slaves, set 'em free, and sign 'em up for his personal bodyguard squad.  
for sure, he said; and he can trust those best, no cap.  
  
what a lit creature, i said, this tyrant must be—offing the others and keeping these as his ultimate homies.  
yes, he said; they're strictly his type.  
  
i said, and these are the brand-new citizens he's conjured up—who stan him and roll with him, while the good ones are all about hating and ghosting him.  
obviously.  
  
for real, then, tragedy is some deep wisdom, and euripides was the ultimate tragedian.  
why's that?  
all 'cause he came through with that bomb quote,  
"tyrants are wise by living with the wise;"  
and he was clearly low-key saying that the wise ones picked as his homies legit make up his squad.  
yes, he said, and he even hypes tyranny as god-tier; plus, plenty more similar vibes are dropped by him and other poet-homies.  
  
and so, i said, those wise tragic poets will forgive us and any future squad if we don’t let 'em into our state—they're like the ultimate droppers of tyranny praise.  
yes, he said, the brainy ones will def forgive us.  
  
but they'll still roll into other cities, pulling in mob after mob, hiring voices that are loud and persuasive, and roping entire cities into both tyranny and democracy vibes.  
so true.  
  
moreover, they score mad cash and receive hella honors—the highest, as you'd expect, from tyrants and the next best from democracies; but the higher they climb our constitutional ladder, the more their rep fades, like they're gasping for air to go further.  
facts.  
  
but we're veering off, so let's bounce back and ask: how does the tyrant keep his lit, big, and constantly changing squad of soldiers?  
  
if, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he'll snatch and splurge them; and if the fortunes of the downfallen can help, he'll slash the taxes he’d otherwise slam on the peeps.  
and when those run out?  
why, obviously, he said, then he and his crew—dude, whether they're dudes or chicks—will keep rollin’ using his dad’s stash.  
so you mean the peeps who birthed him will end up supportin’ him and his homies?  
yes, he said; they literally can't escape it.  
  
but what if the squad flips and says that a grown son shouldn’t be bankrolled by his old man—but rather, the dad should be supported by the son? like, the father didn’t create him just to serve his own crew of scrubs; he raised him to guard him and help break free from that rich, aristocratic flex. so the old man kicks him and his posse out, just like any parent booting out a wild, unruly kid and his sketchy sidekicks.  
  
by heaven, he said, then the old man will see the real monster he’s been cultivating; and when he tries to kick him out, he’ll find himself weak while the son’s rockin’ straight-up boss mode.  
what, you don't seriously mean the tyrant's gonna throw hands against his own old man if he resists, right?  
yes, he will—after disarming him, of course.  
  
and then he’s basically a parricide—a straight-up savage to his own folks; and that’s where real tyranny lies, no question: as the saying goes, the peeps trying to dodge the smoke that is the slavery of freemen end up in the fire that is the tyranny of slaves. so, liberty, when it loses all order and logic, flips into the meanest, bitterest version of slavery.  
true, he said.  
  
alright then; can we say we've done enough dissection on the vibe of tyranny and the flip from democracy to tyranny?  
yes, quite enough, he said.  
  
book ix.  
  
last of all comes the tyrannical man; now, we gotta ask again, how is he molded from democrat vibes, and does he live in joy or pure misery?  
yes, he said, he's the one remaining.  
  
but i said, there's a past question still left hanging.  
what question though?  
  
i don't think we've properly scoped out the deets on how many and what types of cravings we got, and until that's locked down, our inquiry stays a hot mess.  
well, he said, it ain't too late to fix that miss.  
  
deadass, i said; peep this: i reckon some extra, unnecessary pleasures and cravings are totally unlawful. everyone’s got them, but for some peeps they're reined in by laws and sense so that the dope desires win—either they're totally banished or just chill and weak; while for others, they’re juiced up and in overload.  
which appetites you mean?  
  
i mean the ones that wake up when our rational vibe is asleep; then that wild inner beast, loaded with food or drink, shakes off sleep and bolts out to satisfy all its cravings—there’s literally no madness or crime (aside from incest, unnatural hookups, parricide, or snacking on forbidden eats) that someone, having yeeted all shame and sense away, wouldn’t be about to commit.  
most true, he said.  
  
but when a man's got a solid, chill pulse, and before crashing, he fires up his rational engine with noble, deep meditations—letting his cravings be just enough to lull them to sleep so they don't mess with his higher vibe, which he keeps in a pure, abstract mode to ponder the unknown (past, present, or future)—and once he's pacified the two wild impulses and then switches on reason before sleep, then, as you know, he's closest to the truth and dodges those wild, lawless visions.  
i totally agree.  
  
by the way, i might be digressing, but the key deet i wanna drop is that all of us—even the righteous—got a wild, unchained beast nature that sneaks out in sleep. reflect on that and let me know if you're vibing.  
yes, i agree.  
  
and now, remember that vibe we gave the democratic man. from day one, he was schooled by a tightwad parent who hyped saving the essentials but dissed all the extra, frivolous fun.  
true.  
  
and then he rolled with a finer, hedonistic crew, and fed up with his dad's cheapness, he spun all the way to the opposite extreme. eventually, being a stand-up guy compared to his shady influencers, he balanced between both extremes—living not a life of gross, slavish passion but one of moderately measured indulgence in various pleasures. and that's how the democrat was born out of the oligarch.  
yes, he said; that was our take on him, and it holds up still.  
  
and then, i said, fast forward some years, and picture this man having a son, raised with his old man’s principles.  
i can picture him.  
  
then imagine the same play happening to the son as it did with the father: he gets sucked into a wild, lawless life that his seducers hype up as "perfect liberty." meanwhile, his dad and his crew support his moderate cravings while the opposite squad backs the contrary ones. as soon as these shady, tyrant-building magicians sense their grip slipping, they cook up a master passion to implant in him—a sort of monstrous, winged drone vibe—that's the only way to describe him.  
yes, he said, that's exactly how the tyrannical man is born.  
  
and isn't that why, back in the day, love got nicknamed a tyrant?  
i wouldn't be shocked.  
  
further, i said, hasn't a wasted, drunk guy got that tyrant energy too?  
he does.  
  
and you know, a dude who's totally off his mental game will seriously believe he can boss not just men but even the gods.  
that's exactly it.  
  
and the tyrannical man, in the true sense, emerges when, under the push of nature or habit or both, he goes all out drunken, lustful, and passionate—o my friend, isn't that the tea?  
assuredly.  
  
such is the guy and such are his roots. next, how's he actually living?  
suppose, like the peeps jokingly say, you were to spill the tea.  
  
i imagine, i said, that the next chapter in his hustle is all feasts, epic parties, wild bacchanals, and courtesans—love basically being the boss in his heart, running all the drama in his soul.  
that's for sure.  
  
yes; and round the clock, wild desires stack up, formidable as heck, demanding hella attention.  
they definitely are, he said.  
  
and any revenue he scores gets dipped before you know it.  
true.  
  
then come the debts and the straight-up slashing of his property.  
obviously.  
  
when he's left with nada, won't his craving squad—crowding like raven chicks in a nest—be screamin' for sustenance; and spurred on by them, especially by love (the ultimate boss of cravings), he goes wild, scheming to defraud or despoil someone of their stash just to feed his hunger?  
yes, that's totally the vibe.  
  
he absolutely must get cash, any way possible, to dodge those brutal pains and pangs.  
he must.  
  
and as he's got a never-ending cascade of pleasures—new ones kicking out the old—being younger he'll claim he deserves more than his old folks, and if he’s already blown his share, he'll swipe a piece of theirs.  
no doubt, he will.  
  
and if his parents don't cave, he'll first try to cheat and fool them.  
very true.  
  
and if that flap fails, he'll pull the force move and plunder them.  
yes, probably.  
  
and if the old folks fight back for what's theirs, then what, bro? would the creature even have any remorse tyrannizing over his own parents?  
nah, he said, he wouldn't feel any warmth toward his own folks.  
  
but, oh heavens! adeimantus, because of some trendy, extra love for a random harlot (who’s totally non-essential), can you even believe he'd beat his own mom—his ancient, ride-or-die, essential connection—and put her under someone else’s thumb; or that, in a similar sitch, he'd do the same to his decrepit old dad—his first and most crucial mate—for some fresh, blooming youth who's bluntly non-essential?  
yes, indeed, he said; i believe he’d totally do that.  
  
truly then, i said, a tyrannical son is a weird blessing to his old folks.  
he is indeed, he replied.

he first snatches their drip (property), and when that flex fails and his soul’s hive is buzzing with wild feels, he yeets into a crib or swipes the fits of some late-night wanderer; next up, he goes full savage on a temple. meanwhile, the old school opinions he had as a kid – the ones that dished out vibe checks on good and evil – get yeeted out by the freshly liberated squad now riding shotgun with love and repping its empire. back in his democratic days, when he was still chillin’ under the laws and his pops, these thoughts were only let loose in his sleep sesh. but now that love’s got him on lockdown, he’s always, even IRL, living that rare dream he used to catch only in his zzz’s; he’ll commit the dankest murder, munch on off-the-menu snacks, or pull any other cringe-worthy move. love is his ride-or-die dictator, ruling him like a boss and, being a king in his own right, leads him like a full-on tyrant runs a state – making him drop any reckless stunt to keep his vibe and squad, be they toxic outsiders sliding in or the inner circle he let go wild ‘cause they were lowkey evil themselves. aren’t we catching mad vibes of his lifestyle?

yup, he said.

if there are only a few of these clout-chasers in the state while the majority of the peeps are chill, they dip and end up as bodyguards or mercenary homies for another tyrant who probably needs them for a war; and if there’s no war, they just kick it at home, pulling off a bunch of petty mischief around the city.

what kind of mischief?

like, these dudes are the ultimate grabbers—thieves, break-in gangsters, wallet snatchers, boot-pirates, temple robbers, community man-stealers; and if they can even talk, they’ll flip into snitches, drop bogus tea, and take bribes.

a mini catalog of evils, even if the squad doing ’em is lowkey.

yeah, i said; but “small” and “big” are just comparisons, and all this chaos they drop on a state is nothing compared to what the tyrant is about. when this toxic crew and their followers start multiplying and get woke to their power, backed by the people’s hype, they pick the one with the most tyrant vibes deep in his soul, and crown him their boss.

yeah, he said, and that dude’s gonna be the ultimate tyrant.

if the peeps just roll with it, cool; but if they throw up resistance—as he started out by clapping his own parents—then, if he’s got the juice, he’ll smack them down, keeping his beloved fatherland or motherland (as the cretans would say) locked under his young crew he’s anointed as rulers and bosses. that, my friend, is the finale for his wild passions and cravings.

truly.

when these dudes are just private individuals before they snag power, that’s their basic vibe: they only roll with their own hype squad or their ready-made minions; and if they need something, they’re just as quick to bow down and serve—flashing all kinds of fake affection for a hot minute, only to ghost them once they get what they want.

for real.

they’re always either in boss mode or on slave duty, never real friends with anyone; a tyrant never gets to taste genuine freedom or legit friendship.

no cap.

and can we not just call these dudes straight-up backstabbers?

fr fr, no cap.

plus, they’re mad unjust, if our idea of justice is on point?

yeah, he said, and we nailed it.

so let’s sum it up in one word, i said, about the sketchiest dude: he’s like the real-life version of our wildest nightmares.

big facts.

this is the guy who, by nature, is practically built like a tyrant—and the older he gets, the more of a full-blown tyrant he turns out to be.

true af, said glaucon, stepping in to spill.

and won’t the one who’s proven to be the most savage also be the most miserable? the dude who’s been on that tyrant grind the longest is basically stuck in nonstop misery; even if most normies don’t see it that way.

yep, he said, deadass inevitable.

and gotta be that a tyrant man vibes just like a tyrant state, and a democratic man reflects the same in his city; the rest follow suit, right?

hella true.

and just like cities sync up on virtue and happiness, people relate on the same level?

for sure.

so, comparing our original city that was ruled by a king with one under a tyrant, where do they stand on the virtue scale?

they’re polar opposites, he said—one is lit AF while the other is straight-up trash.

no cap, i said, there’s zero confusion on who’s who; now i gotta ask—do you vibe the same on their overall levels of happiness and misery? and yo, we shouldn’t freak out when that tyrant dude shows up, even if he’s just one man with a couple of sidekicks; let’s go full detective mode, scope out every corner of the city, and then drop our verdict.

sounds like a solid invite, he replied; and i peep, like everyone does, that tyranny is the absolute lowest form of government, while a king’s reign is the peak of chill.

and when sizing up the homies too, can i throw in a similar request: i need a judge whose mind can deep dive into human nature—nobody like a kid getting shook by the flashy theatrics of tyrannical swagger, but someone with laser-sharp insight. can we assume that the verdict will be dropped in front of us by someone who’s lived with him, seen him in his everyday grind, watched him stripped of his tragic drip in family vibes, and again during public crises—so he can spill the tea on how the tyrant’s happiness stacks up against other dudes?

that’s a legit call, he said.

so, can we assume we’re seasoned enough to be judges, having met such a dude before? then we’ll have someone to break it all down for us.

deadass.

and yo, don’t forget the parallel between the individual and the state; with that in mind, swing your eyes between the two and tell me how they’re vibin’.

what do you mean? he asked.

starting with the city, i responded, would you say that a city ruled by a tyrant is free or totally locked down?

no lie, he said, no city is more completely enslaved.

but still, you see, aren’t there a few free peeps and some bosses in there?

yeah, he said, i peep a few—but overall, the peeps, even the top-tier, are seriously watered down and enslaved.

so, if a man is like his state, i said, shouldn’t the same vibe apply? his soul is jam-packed with pettiness and crassness—the dopest parts are locked away; and there’s a tiny ruling clique that’s also the most savage and insane.

straight up inevitable.

and would you say that this dude’s soul is that of a freed homie or of a slave?

in my opinion, he’s rocking a slave soul.

and the city under a tyrant, is it rich or lowkey broke?

def poor.

and a tyrant soul is always gonna be broke and craving more?

facts.

and isn’t that state—and that dude—constantly hella shook?

for sure.

is there any city out there with more crying, sorrow, moaning, and pain?

for real, nope.

and is there any dude who’s got more of this misery vibe than a full-on tyrant, all fired up with wild passions and cravings?

impossible, no cap.

after scoping out all this nasty drama, you’re saying the tyrant state is the most miserable of all states?

and i was right, he said.

deadass, i said. and when you spot the same ugliness in a tyrant dude, what do you say about him?

i say he’s without a doubt the most miserable dude ever.

and then i was like, hold up, i think you might be tripping a bit.

what are you saying?

i mean, i don’t think he’s hit peak misery just yet.

so, who in the squad is even more miserable?

i’m about to spill on that one.

who’s that?

the one who’s oozing tyrant vibes by nature and, instead of living a lowkey life, gets cursed with the extra drama of being a public tyrant.

from everything dropped, i gather you know what’s up.

yeah, i replied, but in this high-stakes debate you gotta be 100% sure, not just throwing wild guesses; because when it comes to the whole good vs. evil sitch, this is the ultimate flex.

big facts, he said.

so let me drop an example that might throw some light on the tea.

what’s your example?

peep the rich bosses in cities rolling with mad numbers of slaves: they paint a sick picture of a tyrant’s condition, ‘cause both have slaves—the only diff is, the tyrant just racks up more.

yeah, that’s the diff.

you know these bosses live secure and aren’t sweating about their crew?

what’s there to fear?

nothing, straight up. but notice why?

yeah; it’s 'cause the whole city is vibing together, each one watching out for the other.

big facts, i said. but imagine one of these masters—say he’s running a squad of fifty slaves along with his fam and all his assets—getting yeeted by a god into the wild with zero freemen to back him up. won’t he be straight-up terrified, thinking he, his wife, and his kids might get taken out by his own slaves?

yeah, he said, he would be in utter panic.

then the time comes when he’s forced to sweet-talk a bunch of his slaves, dropping mad promises of freedom and other goodies way against his will—basically, he’s gotta schmooze his own crew.

yeah, he said, that’s his only save.

and now, imagine that same god surrounds him with neighbors who aren’t about letting one dude boss another; if they catch the offender, they’d snatch his life, no joke.

then his situation goes from bad to epic loss, if you think he’s constantly surrounded and watched by haters.

isn’t that exactly the kind of prison a tyrant gets stuck in—this dude who, by nature, is loaded with fears and cravings? his soul’s delicate yet greedy, and on top of that, out of everyone in the city, he never gets to bounce or peep the cool stuff free folks chase, instead living locked in his cave like someone hiding in the crib, jealous of any citizen who steps out and finds something lit.

big facts, he said.

and with all that nasty drama, won’t the dude with trash self-rule—the tyrant man you just called the most miserable—be even more cringey when, instead of living his own life, fate forces him to be a public boss? having to rule others when he can’t even rule himself is like being a busted or broken-down homie forced to spend his days not vibing in peace but constantly throwing down with everyone.

yeah, he said, that comparison is on point.

isn’t his whole vibe utterly tragic? and doesn’t the real tyrant’s life suck majorly more than the one you already branded as the worst?

obviously.

the real tyrant, no matter what people say, is actually the ultimate slave—forced to lay on the flattery and servility, and to butter up even the crummiest humans. he’s got cravings he can never satisfy, always wanting more than anyone else, and is literally poor if you peep the whole soul: his life is an endless horror show of fear, convulsions, and chaotic distractions—just like the state he mirrors. and yo, that resemblance is deadass.

facts, he said.

furthermore, like we dropped earlier, the more power he gets, the worse he becomes: more jealous, more disloyal, more unjust, more friendless, more impious than he was before; he’s the OG dealer and hoarder of all kinds of vices, which means he’s supremely miserable and drags everyone else down with his toxic energy.

no smart homie would disagree with that drip.

so come on, i said, like a ref calling the final score in a play, do you also rank who’s #1 in happiness, who’s #2, and so on? there are five vibes overall—they’re the royal, timocratic, oligarchical, democratic, and tyrannical.

the verdict’s easy, he replied; they’ll roll out like choruses hittin’ the stage, and i gotta rate them in the order they drop, based on virtue vs. vice, happiness vs. misery.

do we even need a hype man, or should i just announce that the son of ariston (the best) has decreed that the most royal and just is also the happiest—that is, the dude who’s the ultimate boss of himself; and that the most trash and unjust is the most miserable, being the biggest self-tyrant and hence the biggest state tyrant?

speak it out yourself, he said.

and should i add, “whether seen or unseen by gods and men”?

yeah, add it.

then, i said, that’s our first piece of tea; and there’s another hint that drops some major cred.

what’s that?

the second proof comes from the nature of the soul: since we split the individual soul, just like the state, into three squads, that division gives us another sick flex.

what kind of division?

i reckon these three parts each roll with their own pleasure vibes; plus, they each have their own set of cravings and ruling energies.

what you mean exactly? he asked.

there’s one squad that vibes with learning, another that goes off in anger; and the third, coming in a bazillion forms, doesn’t have a fancy name but is just tagged as the “appetitive” squad—‘cause it’s charged with that extra oomph for eating, drinking, and all those sensual cravings; it’s also the money-hungry crew since these desires usually get fed with cash.

facts, he said.

if we say that the loves and pleasures of this third squad are all about chasing gain, then we can boil it down to one concept; and we’d clearly call that part of the soul all about money and gain.

i feel that, yeah.

and again, isn’t that fire element totally set on ruling, conquering, and snagging fame?

true.

if we call it the contentious or the ambitious—would that tag work?

hella suitable.

but on the flip side, everyone sees that the knowledge squad is all about the truth and couldn’t care less about clout or cash.

way less.

“lover of wisdom,” “lover of knowledge” are titles that totally fit that part of the soul, right?

certainly.

so we can kick it off by saying there are three types of peeps—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, and lovers of gain?

exactly.

and there are three separate flavors of pleasure, each aimed at its own vibe?

very true.

now, if you scope out these three types of peeps and ask each which life is the most lit, they’ll all be hyping their own while dissing the others: the money-maker will flex about how honour or learning is just vanity if it doesn’t bring in the cash, compared to the solid perks of gold and silver.

true, he replied.

and the honour-lover—what’s his take? won’t he call the pleasure of riches basic, while saying the pleasure of learning, if it doesn’t come with major props, is all smoke and mirrors?

very true.

and should we assume, i said, that the philosopher doesn’t even compare other pleasures with the joy of cracking the truth—living that constant quest for knowledge that’s practically heaven? doesn’t he say that if those other pleasures weren’t totally necessary, he’d just pass on ’em?

no doubt, he replied.

so since every class is debating its own pleasure—it's not about which life is higher in honour or strictly better, but which one is the most chill and pain-free—how do we know who’s dropping the real tea?

i honestly can’t say, he said.

so, what should be the gold standard? isn’t experience, wisdom, and reason the ultimate flex?

no bet, there ain’t nothing better, he said.

then, i said, think on this: among the three peeps, who’s clocked the most experience with all these pleasures? does the gain-chaser, even after trying to learn the real deal, know the pleasure of truth more than the philosopher knows the pleasure of stacking gains?

the philosopher, he replied, definitely has the upper hand; he’s been tasting all the flavors since he was a kid, whereas the gain-hustler, no matter how much he’s grinding, has hardly ever sampled—or even craved—the sweet drip of learning and truth.

so, the wisdom-lover has a massive flex over the gain-lover, ‘cause he’s got double the experience?

yup, mad advantages.

and again, does the honour vibe weigh more for one or does the wisdom squad drop the honour game harder?

nah, he said, all three get their props in line with what they chase; the rich, the brave, and the wise all pull in their own fans and get that honour, but the pure ecstasy of knowing true being is a vibe only the philosopher gets.

so his experience means he can judge way better than everyone?

def way better.

and he’s the only dude who’s rocking both wisdom and mad experience?

certainly.

plus, that very tool for judgment isn’t in the hands of the greedy or ambitious—it’s all in the philosopher’s kit.

which tool, bruh?

reason, the ultimate ride-or-die, where every decision should chill.

yeah.

and reasoning is totally his superpower, right?

totally.

if cash and gain were the measure, then the gain-lover’s shoutout would be the most on point?

assuredly.

or if it was all about honour or victory or courage then the ambitious or fighter’s call would be the truth?

clearly.

but since it’s experience, wisdom, and reason calling the shots—

the only takeaway, he replied, is that the pleasures blessed by the wisdom squad and reason are the real deal.

and so we land on the conclusion that the pleasure from the brainiac side of the soul is the ultimate vibe of all three, and that the one among us who runs with that energy lives the dopest life.

no doubt, he said—the wise homie always drops truth bombs when he gives a solid nod to his own life.

and what does our judge say is next in line for life and pleasure?

clearly, it’s the life of the soldier and honour-lover; that vibe’s way closer to his true self than the money-maker’s.

and last comes the gain-hustler?

true that, he said.

so twice in a row the just dude’s clapped the unjust in this showdown; and now comes the third trial, dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is 100% real and pure – every other pleasure is just a shadow play; and for real, that drop is gonna be the ultimate mic drop, right?

yeah, the biggest drop; but can you spill the deets?

i'm gonna break down this subject and you gonna drop your responses, no cap.

proceed.

so like, isn't pleasure just the opposite of pain?  
true.

and there’s a chill midzone that's neither full-on pleasure nor straight-up pain?  
bet, there is.

so you're saying it's like a dope in-between state—a legit soul chill zone where both extremes take a backseat?  
yup.

you remember what peeps be saying when they're hella sick?  
what do they say?

they be like, "real talk, nothing is as lit as being healthy." but low-key, they never peep that being healthy was the ultimate vibe until they got mad sick.  
yep, i know, he said.

and when someone’s in intense pain, you’ve def heard them go, "yo, ditchin' that hurt is the ultimate glow-up," right?  
i have.

and there’s mad other times when just chillin’—that pause from pain—is hyped as the peak pleasure, not some extra dope sensation?  
yeah, he said; at that moment, they’re straight-up vibin' and content just to be at rest.

but then, when the pleasure ghosts, that kinda chill turns hella painful?  
doubtless, he said.

so then this in-between rest is like a combo of pleasure and pain at once?  
it would seem so.

but can something totally neutral flex as both sides at the same time?  
nah, i gotta say, not.

and both pleasure and pain are major moves of the soul, right?  
yep.

but what we just peeped—that neutral vibe—is straight-up rest, not motion, like a chill midpoint?  
yeah.

so how can we be trippin’ in thinkin’ that no pain equals pleasure, or that no pleasure equals pain?  
impossible.

so this whole scene is just an appearance—a flex of comparisons: rest looks like pleasure against pain, and pain looks extra harsh compared to pleasure; but when you test for real-deal pleasure, it’s all just bogus impositions, ya feel?  
that's the inference.

peep the other squad of pleasures that roll in with zero prior pain, and you won’t keep thinkin’ that pleasure is merely cancelin’ pain or that pain is just the flip side of pleasure.  
what be they, and where do i find 'em?

there’s a whole lit collection—like the pleasures of a dope scent; they hit you in a moment, no baggage of pain, and when they bounce, they leave zero hurt behind.  
most true, he said.

so let’s not get played into thinkin’ that pure pleasure is just the end of pain, or that pain is simply the absence of pleasure.  
no.

still, those extra wild and savage pleasures that hit the soul via the body are generally just major pain relievers, right?  
that's true.

and when you're hyped about future vibes—whether good or bad—they’re on the same level?  
yes.

shouldi drop an example of that vibe?  
hit me up.

yo, you gotta agree that nature’s got an upper, a middle, and a lower zone, right?  
i should.

and if someone hops from the lowest zone to the midzone, wouldn’t they think they’re leveling up; and if a dude chillin' in the midzone peeks at where he came from, he’d flex that he’s already upper-tier—even if he’s never peeped the true upper world?  
for sure, he said; how could he think otherwise?

but if he gets dragged back down, he’d straight-up feel like he's descending?  
no doubt.

all that just comes from bein’ clueless about the real upper, middle, and lower vibes?  
yeah.

so can you be shook that peeps who are lowkey ignorant about the truth—and mess up on other stuff too—also end up with whack ideas about pleasure, pain, and that in-between state; so that when they’re drawn into pain they feel it heavy and think it’s the real deal, and when they bounce into the neutral zone they swear they’ve hit peak pleasure; they, not knowing true pleasure, end up comparing pain with no pain like mismatching shades—comparing black to grey instead of white—can you vibe with that?  
no, indeed; i'd be even more shook if it were the other way around.

check it out: hunger, thirst, and the like are just the bodily state runnin' on empty, right?  
yes.

and ignorance and dumb moves? they're the soul's low battery, true.  
true.

and food and wisdom are the legit refills for each?  
certainly.

so the satisfaction you get from what’s packing more real existence is way more on point than from something that’s lacking that vibe?  
clearly, it’s from that which has more.

which squad, in your view, is loaded with more of that pure existence—the crew that includes food, drinks, condiments and all kinds of sustenance, or the squad that’s about real opinions, knowledge, mind vibes, and all kinds of virtue?  
put it like this: which one’s got that ultra-pure being—one that’s about the unchanging, immortal, and true, or the one that’s all variable and mortal?  
far purer, he replied, is the vibe of the unchanging squad.

and does the essence of that unchanging vibe flex as much knowledge as it does pure essence?  
yes, it's on the same level.

and what about truth?  
yes.

and conversely, if something’s lacking truth, it’s also low-key on essence?  
necessarily.

so basically, stuff that’s all about the body has way less truth and essence than that which vibes for the soul?  
heaps less.

and doesn’t even the body itself come up short on truth and essence compared to the soul?  
yes.

whatever’s loaded with more real existence, that’s more mad filled than something with less real juice, right?  
of course.

and if there's a lit pleasure in being filled with what’s natural, then the one more loaded with true being will genuinely enjoy that ultimate pleasure; whereas something that’s lacking real being will only catch some fake, flimsy pleasure.  
unquestionably.

so those who ain't down with wisdom and virtue—and are always caught up in gluttony and nonstop sensuality—keep bouncing around in that midzone; in this area, they wander randomly through life, never making it to the true upper world; they don’t even peep its vibe, never getting filled with true being, and never tasting that pure, enduring pleasure. like a herd of cattle, with eyes always glued downward and heads stooped low (yup, fixated on the dining table), they get fat, feast, and breed, and in their obsessive love for these delights, they end up kickin' and buttin' each other with horns and iron hooves; they even off each other from their insatiable lust. for they pack themselves with stuff that’s unsubstantial, and the bit they fill up is also unsubstantial and hella unruly.

verily, socrates, said glaucon, you just dropped oracle-level truth about how most peeps live.  
their pleasures are mixed with pain—how else would it go down? 'cause they're just weak shadows and sketches of the true, all tinted by contrasts that hype both the bright and the dark, implanting wild and insane desires in clueless minds; and they end up clashin' like stesichorus said that the greeks battled over helen's shadow at troy, all clueless about the real deal.  
something like that’s bound to go down, inevitably.

and don't you think the same wild mess happens with the fiery, passionate element of the soul? like, the dude who channels his passion into action—whether he's envious and extra, violent and always beefin', or mad hot-headed and discontented—if he's out there chasin' clout, victory, and tryin' to let his anger run wild without reason or sense, then the same drama hits that spirited part too?  
yes, he said, that's exactly it.

so then, can we confidently drop that the peeps who stan money and clout, when they chase their thrills with reason and knowledge on deck, and hustle to snag the real pleasures that wisdom shows them, will also score the truest, highest-level pleasures possible 'cause they're stickin' with truth; and they'll get the natural pleasures meant for them if what’s best for each is also the most natural to 'em?  
yes, for sure; the best is the most natural.

and when the whole soul is vibin' on that philosophical wavelength, with no internal drama—each part doin' its own dope thang and flexin' the ultimate pleasures it's capable of?  
exactly.

but when one of the other two principles takes over, it ends up failing to secure its own vibe and forces the rest to chase some ghostly, off-brand pleasure that's not even theirs?  
true.

and the further you drift from philosophy and reason, the weirder and more illusive the pleasure becomes?  
yes.

and clearly, what's furthest from reason is the one mad distanced from law and order?  
clearly.

and the lusty, tyrannical desires are, as we peeped, at the far end?  
yes.

and the royal, orderly vibes are the closest?  
yes.

so the tyrant's locked in the deepest void from real, natural pleasure, and the king's riding the nearest wave?  
certainly.

but if that's the tea, then the tyrant’s life is gonna be super cringey while the king’s life is mad pleasant?  
inevitably.

you down to break down the measure of this gap between them?  
will you break it down for me?

there appear to be three types of pleasure—one that's the real vibe and two that are bogus; now the tyrant’s level of transgression goes beyond the fake zone—he bails from the realm of law and reason, locking himself with these slave pleasures orbiting around him, and his inferiority can only be summed up as a number.  
how do you mean?

i’m thinking that the tyrant sits in third place relative to the oligarch; and the democrat lands in the middle?  
yes.

and if my logic's on point, then he'll be shackled to a pleasure image that's three times removed in truth from the oligarch’s vibe?  
he will.

and the oligarch is third away from the royal, since we count royal and aristocratic as one squad?  
yes, he’s third.

then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by a gap equal to three times three?  
manifestly.

so the shadow of tyrannical pleasure, measured by that number, forms like a flat plane?  
certainly.

and if you crank up the math and turn that plane into a solid, it's obvious how massive the gap is between the tyrant and the king.  
yes; the arithmetician will totally nail the sum.

or if someone starts at the other end and measures how far the king is from the tyrant in true pleasure, they'll find that, after crunching the numbers, the king is livin' 729 times more lit, and the tyrant is sufferin' 729 times harder by that same margin.  
what a wild calculation! and damn, how enormous is the gap that splits the just from the unjust in terms of pleasure and pain!  
yet it's a legit computation, i said, with a number that nearly vibes with human life—if you think about days, nights, months, and years. (729 is almost the number of days and nights in a year, no cap.)

yeah, he said, human life is totally wrapped up in that.

then if the good, just dude is that way superior in pleasure compared to the evil, unjust one, his overall upgrade in livin'—in beauty, virtue, and proper vibes—will be off the charts?  
immeasurably greater.

well, i said, and now that we’ve hit this level, let’s bounce back to what got us here: wasn't someone sayin’ that injustice actually scores a gain for those supposedly perfectly unjust peeps who are seen as just?  
yes, that was said.

now then, having scoped out the power and drip of justice versus injustice, let’s slide into a little chat with that dude.  
what should we say to him?

let’s whip up a dope mental image of the soul, so he gets his own vibe right in front of his eyes.  
what kinda vibe?

an idealized image of the soul, like those composite creatures from ancient myth—think chimera, scylla, or cerberus, plus a ton more where different natures fuse into one epic beast.  
word is, those unions went down.

so now, flex a model of a many-headed monster—a beast with a ring of heads of all kinds, tame and wild—that he can spawn and morph on a whim.  
you assume the artist’s got epic powers; but since language is way more flexible than wax, let there be such a model as you propose.

now imagine you craft a second form in the likeness of a lion, and a third as a man—the lion being smaller than the beast form, and the man even smaller than the lion.  
that's an easier flex, he said; and i did it just like you said.

and now merge 'em, letting the three grow into one epic fusion.  
that's been accomplished.

next, shape their outer layer into one single image—as if it were just a man—so that anyone who can only peep the surface ends up thinking the beast is one human creature.  
i've done that, he said.

and now, to the dude who claims it's profiting for a human to be unjust and that being just is a loss, let's clap back and say: if you're right, then it's like this creature's feasting on that many-headed monster and beefin' up the lion vibes, while leavin' the inner man starved and weak—making him liable to get wrecked by either squad; and he ain't tryna harmonize 'em, but rather letting them clash, bite, and devour each other.  
certainly, he said; that's exactly what the injustice aprover preaches.

to that, the justice supporter fires back that the dude should always speak and act to give the inner man total mastery over the entire self. he should keep watch over that many-headed monster like a top-tier husbandman, nurturing the chill, gentle qualities and blocking the wild ones from blowin' up; he should squad up with that lion-heart and unite all the parts with one another and with himself.  
yes, he said—that's precisely what the maintainer of justice says.

and so, from every angle—whether in terms of pleasure, clout, or straight-up gains—the one backing justice is on point and droppin' truth, while the one dissing it is off-base, bogus, and clueless?  
yes, from every angle.

come on, now, let's gently reason with the unjust dude, who ain't intentionally messin' up. "sweet sir," we say, "what's your take on things deemed noble versus ignoble? isn't the noble that which keeps the beast in check with the man—or rather, channels that god-like spark within the man; and the ignoble that which turns the man into a full-on beast?"  
he can hardly dodge sayin' yes—can he?  
not if he even gives a damn about my opinion.

but if he’s vibin’ with that so far, then ask him: "then how does a dude profit if he gets gold and silver on the deal that he must enslave his noblest self to the worst vibes? who in their right mind thinks that a man who sells his own son or daughter into slavery for cash—especially droppin' them into the hands of fierce, evil peeps—comes out a gainer, no matter how fat the sum? and can anyone not call him a miserable caitiff, cold-heartedly sellin' his divine spark to the most godless, detestable force? eriphyle snagged that necklace as the price for her hubby’s life, but this dude’s takin' bribes to wrench a far worse ruin."  
yes, said glaucon, far worse—i'll answer on his behalf.

hasn't the overindulgent been roasted since way back for letting that huge, multiform monster run unchecked?  
clearly.

and don't dudes get slammed for their pride and short fuse when their lion and serpent vibes go into overdrive?  
yes.

and luxury and softness get trashed because they chill out and weaken that same creature, turnin' a strong vibe into a total wuss?  
very true.

and isn't a dude called out for being all fake and petty when he subordinates his spirited animal to that unruly monster, and—mad obsessed with cash, which he can never have enough of—trains it in his youth to get trampled in the mire, flipping it from lion mode to straight-up monkey?  
true, he said.

and why are low-key, manual hustles looked down on? it's only 'cause they hint at a natural weakness in the higher principle; the individual can't control the wild inner creatures and ends up havin' to cozy up to 'em, making his whole grind about buttering 'em up.  
such appears to be the reason.

and therefore, if we're tryna place him under a rule by the best, we say he ought to be the servant of the best—in whom the divine vibes rule; not, as thrasymachus supposed, to hurt the servant, but 'cause everyone should be ruled by that divine wisdom chillin' inside them; or, if that's a no-go, then by some external authority so that we can all roll under the same government, as friends and equals.  
true, he said.

and it's hella clear that this is what the law's about—the city's ride-or-die ally; it's also seen in the authority we hold over kids, not lettin' them run wild until we've instilled in 'em a principle similar to the state’s constitution, and by nurturing that higher element, we set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own—and once that's solid, they can bounce on their own.  
yes, he said, the law’s purpose is manifest.

so, from what angle or ground can we say a dude profits from injustice, intemperance, or any base trash that only makes him a worse human—even if he snags cash or power through his shady ways?  
from absolutely no angle.

what’s he gonna gain if his shady moves fly under the radar and go unpunished? the dude who stays undetected only gets worse, while the one who gets caught and slammed gets his brutal side silenced and humanized; his gentler vibe is set free, and his whole soul gets leveled up and ennobled by snagging justice, temperance, and wisdom—way more than the body ever does from pickin' up beauty, strength, and health, proportional to how honourable the soul is compared to the body.  
certainly, he said.

for this nobler vibe, the wise dude devotes his entire energy. and first up, he’s gonna stan the studies that impress these fly qualities on his soul while dissing the rest.  
clearly, he said.

next, he’s gonna regulate his bod’s habits and training so he stays so far from yieldin’ to brutal, irrational pleasures that even health becomes a secondary flex; his main move isn’t just to be fine-looking, strong, or healthy—unless that levels him up in temperance—but he’ll always work to sync his body to keep his soul in perfect harmony.  
certainly he will, if his inner music is straight fire.

and when it comes to stackin’ cash, there’s a vibe of order and harmony he’s gonna observe; he won’t let the world's foolish claps blind him and pile up riches to his own infinite harm.  
certainly not, he said.

he’s gonna peep the inner city within him and make damn sure no chaos—whether from excess or scarcity—messes with it; and based on that, he’ll manage his property, gain, or spend strictly by his means.  
very true.

and for the same reason, he’ll gladly accept and vibe with honors that he thinks make him a better dude; but any honors, whether private or public, that might mess up his flow, he’ll straight-up ghost.

then, if that is his motive, he ain't gonna be no legit statesman.

by the dog of egypt, he def will! in his own crib he’s totally the boss, though back in his hometown he might not flex—unless he’s hit with a divine call, no cap.

i feel you; you mean he’ll be the ruler of that city we built from scratch—a city that exists only as a pure idea—'cause i seriously don’t think such a homie ever roamed the real world.

in heaven, i replied, there’s this dope template laid out, so anyone with the drive can peep it and get their own house game in order. but whether that blueprint pops off in real-life or stays forever a vibe? honestly, it don’t matter; he’s gonna live that city life, ghosting all other cliques.

bet, he said.

book x.

among all the fire qualities i peep in our state’s design, nothin’ slaps harder than our savage rule on poetry.

what you even tryna say?

i’m talkin’ ‘bout snubbin’ all that copycat, imitative poetry that just ain’t worth your time—now that the different squad members of the soul have been unboxed, it’s crystal clear.

uh, what exactly you on about?

lowkey, i’m spillin’ tea in private—don’t wanna have these tragedian clout-chasers and the rest of the imitation tribe run their mouths—but honestly, all that poetical mimicry straight-up wrecks the brain vibes of the crowd, and knowing its true nature is the only antidote to that weak sauce.

break it down for me—what’s the tea?

alright, lemme drop some knowledge: even though i’ve been shook and mad in love with homer since day one—dude’s such the OG captain and mentor of that charming tragic squad—that doesn’t give him more clout than the truth itself. so, i gotta speak my mind.

lit, he said.

so, hmu and listen up, or better yet, drop your response.

fire your question.

yo, can you break down for me what imitation even is? 'cause i’m straight-up clueless.

lol, you’d think i’d be on that level.

why not? sometimes the basic peeps spot stuff faster than the ultra-hypes, ya feel me?

facts, he said; but with you around, even if i had a half-ass idea, i wouldn’t have the guts to drop it. you wanna check it out yourself?

alright, so let’s kick off our investigation the classic way: whenever a bunch of individuals share a common name, we vibe that they also share a matching mental blueprint or form—catch my drift?

i got you.

peep this: there are tons of beds and tables in the world, right?

yeah.

but lowkey, there’s only two blueprint vibes—one for a bed and one for a table.

facts.

and the dude who whips up a bed or table does it following that idea vibe—that’s just our way of choppin’ it up—but no craftsman is out here creating the actual blueprint itself. how would that even work?

deadass impossible.

and then there’s another creative beast—I’m curious, what do you say about him?

who’s that?

the one who bosses up all the work of every other craftsman—the supreme creator.

yo, that’s one epic dude!

hold up, there’s more: this is the guy who not only makes every type of vessel, but also plants, animals, himself, and, like, literally everything—the earth, the heavens, and all the bits in between; he even snaps up the gods in his lineup.

for real, he’s a straight-up wizard, no cap.

omg, you sound shook—so you tryna say there’s no real creator, or that on one level there might be a creator of all these things but on another, nah? like, could you even whip them all up yourself?

how so?

it’s mad simple; there are tons of ways to pull it off real quick—none faster than just spinning a mirror on loop. soon enough, you’d have the sun, the heavens, the earth, yourself, all the animals and plants, and everything we just dropped in conversation, all in that mirror reflection.

yeah, he said; but they’d just be clout-worthy appearances, not the real deal.

lit, i said—you’re really hitting the main vibe now. and check it: the painter is basically the same—a creator of mere appearances, right?

obviously.

but then i guess you’re gonna say what he makes isn’t the real truth. and yet, isn’t there a way in which the painter can whip up a bed too?

yup, he said, but it’s just a low-res, fake bed.

and what about the actual bed maker? weren’t you saying that he only makes a specific, particular bed—not the essential, true blueprint of the bed itself?

yep, i did.

so if he ain’t crafting what’s genuinely real, then he can’t create true existence—just a weak, lifelike copy; and if anyone tries to say that the craftsman’s work is the real deal, they’re straight-up spreading fake news.

anyway, he replied, philosophers would call that straight-up bogus.

no cap, that’s why his work is just a fuzzy echo of truth.

facts.

so, let’s peep who this imitator actually is, based on our examples?

sure thing.

alright, here’s the tea: we got three beds. one is totally naturally popping off, made by god—‘cause, come on, who else would be the maker?

nah.

there’s another that’s straight-up carpenter-made, right?

def.

and the painter’s work is a third kind?

yep.

so beds come in three flavors, and there are three boss-level creators running the show: god, the bed maker, and the painter.

yeah, three for real.

god, whether it was a vibe or a must-do, only dropped one natural bed—no duplicates, no re-runs—'cause if he dropped two, a third one would magically slide in as the true blueprint that both copies reference, and that would be the ideal bed, not the knock-offs.

so why’s that?

‘cause even if he cranked out two, a third would always pop up as the OG idea that the first two try to mimic—and that OG is the real ideal bed.

facts, he said.

god was totally woke to this, and he wanted to be the ultimate boss—the real maker of a genuine bed, not just some one-off craftsman—so he dropped a bed that, by nature, is one and only.

that’s what we believe.

so, are we gonna call him the natural author, the original creator of the bed?

yeah, he replied; since through his natural creative process, he’s the mastermind behind this and every other thing.

and what about the carpenter—isn’t he also out here making beds?

yup.

but would you call the painter a legit creator and maker?

nah, not at all.

so if he ain’t the maker, what’s his role with the bed?

i think, he said, that we can straight up dub him the imitator—the copycat of what the others produce.

cool, i said; so you’re saying the dude who’s third in line from nature is just a mimic?

certainly, he said.

and the tragic poet is also an imitator—so, like all imitators, he’s three steps removed from the king and the truth?

that seems to be the tea.

alright, so we’re on the same page about imitators. but what about the painter? i wanna know if he’s copying what exists naturally or just mimicking artist-made creations.

nah, he only copies the artist’s hustle.

as they actually are or just as they vibe? you gotta lock that down.

what do you mean?

i mean, you can peep a bed from all angles—side-eye, top-down, however you slice it—and it’ll look different, but deep down, nothing’s changed. same goes for literally everything.

yep, he said, it’s just an optical trick.

so now, here’s another one: is painting meant to mimic things as they truly are or just as they appear—a vibe of appearance versus reality?

appearance, no doubt.

so basically, the imitator, i said, is hella far from the real truth—only grazing a tiny bit of the whole deal, which ends up as just an image. like, a painter might drop a pic of a cobbler, a carpenter, or any other pro without even knowing their craft, and if he’s good, he might straight-up fool kids or noobs from afar into thinking they’re seeing a real carpenter.

facts.

and whenever some dude claims he found a guy who’s basically a know-it-all in every art, with super-accurate deets on everything—i mean, we can only assume this dude’s a total simp who got duped by some wizard or actor he met, thinking they were omniscient, 'cause he couldn’t break down the real deal between knowledge, ignorance, and imitation.

big facts.

so when we hear folks say that tragedians—and homer leading the pack—know every art and all things human, from virtue to vice and even the divine, claiming that a good poet can only drop heat if he truly knows his subject, and that without that knowledge he’ll never be a true poet, we gotta wonder if they’re falling for the same scam. maybe they got catfished by imitators, forgetting that these works are just knock-offs, three layers removed from the truth, made without any real deets because they’re all about appearances, not reality. or maybe they’re right, and poets genuinely get the stuff they rave about?

the question, he said, definitely deserves a deep think.

so, do you figure that if someone could whip up both the original and its image, would he ever settle for just being an image-maker? would he let imitation be his whole life’s vibe, as if he had no higher calling?

i’d say nope.

the true artist—the one who really gets what he’s copying—would be all about the real, authentic vibe instead of mere imitations; he’d wanna leave behind a stack of epic, aesthetic legacies, and instead of being the one dishing out praise, he’d prefer to be the subject of that praise.

yeah, he said, that would score him mad respect and serious clout.

then, i said, we gotta hit up homer with a question—not about medicine or any arts his poems casually mention. we’re not gonna ask him or any poet if he patched up patients like asclepius or started a whole med-school vibe like the asclepiads, or if he just dished out secondhand tea on medicine; but we deserve to know about military tactics, politics, education—the top-tier, noble topics in his verses. so we say, “friend homer, if you’re only one layer away from the truth in what you say about virtue—not a full-on image mimester—and if you can actually peep what hustles level up or down men in both private and public life, then drop this: which state was ever better governed because of your help? lacedaemon’s chill order? that’s all lycurgus’s rep, and mad other cities got their groove from other peeps; so who says you were a boss legislator who did any real good? italy and sicily throw mad props for charondas, and solon gets his own cheers; so what city can brag about you?”—is there any city that can drop your name in that way?

i think not, glaucon said; not even the homerids themselves claim he was a legislator.

but fr, was there any war he actually helped win with his counsel while he was still in the game?

nah, none.

or is there any invention credited to him—something that applies to the arts or everyday life—like those drops from thales the milesian, anacharsis the scythian, or other genius dudes?

absolutely zilch.

so, if homer never did any public service, was he at least a personal guide or mentor? did he have a crew of ride-or-die peeps who vibed with his homeric way of life—like how pythagoras was mad loved for his wisdom and his followers still get mad props for that order?

nothing like that is ever on record about him. for real, socrates, creophylus—homer’s homie, that mere mortal whose name always cracks us up—might even get roasted harder for being clueless, since they say homer was majorly ghosted by him and his crew back in the day.

yeah, i replied, that’s the tradition. but, glaucon, imagine if homer had actually been the real mvp who schooled and leveled up mankind—if he had legit knowledge instead of being just a mimic—wouldn’t he have been flooded with followers and mad love? look, protagoras of abdera, prodicus of ceos, and a whole squad of others only need to whisper to their crew: “you ain’t gonna run your crib or state until you name us as your education ministers”—and that slick hustle got people so hyped, they practically carried these dudes on their shoulders. and is it even possible that homer’s or hesiod’s own day squad would let these legends roam free as rhapsodists if they actually could make mankind virtuous? wouldn’t they clutch them like gold, making them stick around? or if the boss dipped, wouldn’t the disciples trail him everywhere until they maxed out on education?

yes, socrates, that's totally the vibe.

then, aren’t we forced to deduce that all these poetic peeps, starting with homer, are nothing but imitators? they straight-up copy snapshots of virtue and all that jazz, but never hit the real truth. a poet is like that painter we mentioned—dropping a pic of a shoemaker even though he’s clueless about the craft—and his work scores enough with the noob crowd who judge only by looks and colors.

deadass.

similarly, the poet with his words just slaps on the color schemes of all the arts, barely understanding their true nature—only mimicking the vibe—while the equally clueless audience only judges based on his flow, thinking that if he raps about cobbling, military tactics, or anything else in smooth metre, harmony, and rhythm, he’s spitting pure fire. that’s the natural flex of melody and rhythm. and i’m sure you’ve peeped how bland poet tales are when you strip away that musical color and just recite them in plain prose.

yep, he said.

they’re like faces that were never truly stunning—just extra for a hot minute—and now the youthful bloom has totally faded.

exactly.

here’s another point: the imitator, the one droppin’ images, knows nada about the real deal; he only gets surface-level appearances. right?

yes.

so let’s get it straight—no half-baked tea here.

spill it.

about the painter, we say he’ll drop an image of reins and even a bit, right?

yeah.

and the leather and brass crew actually crafts the real ones?

certainly.

but does the painter even know the proper form of the bit and reins? nah—hardly do even the brass-and-leather makers; only the rider who actually uses them knows their true shape.

for real.

so, can’t we say that applies to all stuff?

what you mean?

that there are three arts dealing with everything: one that uses, one that makes, and one that just copies it?

yup.

and the excellence, beauty, or truth of every structure—whether living or not—and of every human move is tied to the purpose nature or the creator originally intended.

true that.

so the end-user must be the real mvp with the most insight, showing the maker what’s lit or whack when the work’s in action; like, a flute player will drop to the flute maker which flute actually slaps, guiding him on how to tweak it, and the maker listens up.

for sure.

the user knows his vibe and speaks authority on the goodness or trash of flutes, while the maker—trusting that feedback—just follows his lead.

true that.

the instrument stays the same, but the maker only gets the proper deets on its quality from the knowledgeable user, while the user holds the real insight.

facts.

but will the copycat ever get any of that? will he know from experience whether his drawing is on point or fresh? or is he only gonna have a lame opinion by tagging along with someone who’s got the real juice?

nah, neither.

so he ain’t gonna score any real opinion or knowledge about his imitations’ quality.

i suppose so.

like, will the imitator ever be a genius about his own work?

nah, he’s actually the opposite.

and still, he’ll keep spamming copies without ever knowing what makes something truly great or trash, and will only vibe with what looks dope to the clueless masses.

exactly.

so far, we’re all on the same wavelength: the imitator has zero real knowledge about what he’s copying. imitation’s just a kind of playful sport, and tragic poets—whether in iambic or heroic flow—are, like, the ultimate copycats.

no cap, very true.

and now, i conjure you: haven’t we shown that imitation is, like, three moves removed from the real truth?

definitely.

and what part of a human’s vibe is even the target for imitation?

explain, bruh.

i mean, like, an object that looks huge up close will seem tiny from far away, right?

true that.

and the same object looks straight when you see it out of water, but all crooked when submerged; and something concave can flip to look convex—thanks to our eyes getting tricked by colors. so, mad confusion shows up inside us, and that’s the weak spot the art of trickery—light, shadow, and other clever hacks—exploits, hitting us like straight-up magic.

facts.

and then the homies of measuring, counting, and weighing swoop in to save our understanding—and there’s a whole beauty in that—so the whole vibe of “more” or “less,” “heavier” or “lighter” stops running the show and bows down to cold, hard calculation.

for real true.

and this gotta be the work of that calculating, rational side of our soul, right?

for sure.

and when that part checks and confirms that some things are equal, or that some are greater or lesser than others, an apparent contradiction pops off?

true.

but didn’t we say a legit contradiction is impossible—the same brain can’t have two totally opposite takes on the same thing at once?

deadass.

so that part of the soul giving off a vibe that clashes with the measure isn’t the same as the part that vibes with the proper measure, right?

true.

and the smartest part of our soul is the one that trusts in measurement and calculation, yeah?

totally.

and whatever vibes against that is just one of the inferior, trash principles of our soul?

no doubt, fam.

that’s exactly the conclusion i was aiming for when i said that painting, drawing, and imitation in general—when doing their own gig—are hella far removed from the truth, hanging out with parts of our soul that are just as off-reason, and they ain’t got any real, healthy purpose.

exactly.

imitative art is like a low-tier bae marrying another low-tier, and they only spawn inferior, trash offspring.

so true.

yo, so is this only a sight flex, or does it also hit your earwaves, reppin’ what we call poetry, no cap?

bet, same deal applies to poetry.

i’m not just tryna drip some random vibes from that painting sim analogy; let's dive deep and peep whether that insta-level poet copycat skill is lit or straight trash, fam.

fr, go ahead.

so here's the tea: imitation copies the moves of peeps, whether they’re doing it on purpose or totally by accident, and they think somethin’ good or bad went down—so they get all hyped or totally salty about it—and that’s pretty much the whole story. anything extra, or nah?

nah, that’s it, end of story.

but yo, in all these wild scenarios, is the dude even vibing with his own self? like, just as his eyeballs get all shook up with mixed feels over the same stuff, doesn’t his life end up like a chaotic group chat full of clashing opinions? ngl, we already all agreed on that; our soul is basically a nonstop stream of, like, a thousand drama drops happening at once, fr.

and he was like, “facts, we got it right.”

i was like, “yeah, so far so good—but we totally missed a crucial deetz that needs that extra glow-up.”

omg, what did we forget?

didn’t we drop that a real one, even when he loses his son or his most prized treasure, handles the hit with way more chill vibes than someone else?

facts.

but yo, does that mean he’s completely numb, or is it like, he still gets sad but keeps it low-key?

he clapped back, “nah, he’ll def catch feels, but he levels them down, no cap.”

so, tell me fam: is he more likely to battle his sadness when everyone’s watching, or when he’s just vibing solo?

tbh, it’s a whole different energy if he’s on display versus chillin’ incognito.

like, when he’s alone, he’s gonna drop so many off-the-cuff moves that he’d be super embarrassed if anyone caught him in the act, fr.

for sure.

there’s like, this inner rulebook in him telling him to hold it down, plus his own raw pain pushing him to dive into his sorrow.

facts.

but real talk, when a dude’s pulled in two opposite vibes over the same tea, that legit means he’s got two clashing inner crews, no cap.

100%.

one crew’s all about sticking to the rulebook, right?

explain, bruh.

basically, the rulebook says chill under the struggle, fam; don’t let impatience win, ‘cause who’s to say if stuff is lit or totally trash? impatience nets you nada—and honestly, no human drama is that major, plus being over-sad just blocks you from snagging what’s most needed at the moment.

he was like, “so, what’s the real must-have right now?”

we gotta chat about what went down, and once the dice are thrown, we gotta reorg our hustle based on what pure reason deems best; not like kids who, after a fall, cling to their boo-boo and waste time throwing a fit, but rather always train their soul to bounce back, uplift what’s fallen, and yeet away that sorrow with some epic healing moves.

he was like, “facts, that’s the ultimate hack for fending off life’s shade.”

i replied, “so does your high-key inner boss ride with this reason vibe?”

obviously, bet.

and then there’s that other emo crew in us that’s all about rehashing our troubles and wallowing, always craving that extra dose of lament—totally irrational, weak sauce, and straight-up cowardenergy.

deadass, no cap.

and check it: that rebellious side serves up endless meme material for copycats, whereas that wise, chill vibe is hella tough to nail—especially on stage when a random crowd in a theatre doesn’t even relate to such calm energy.

facts, obviously.

so the copycat poet, tryna go viral, isn’t built to please the soul’s rational boss; they’re all about that hot-and-cold, extra feels vibe that’s way easier to mimic, no cap.

for sure.

and now, legit, we can toss this guy right next to a lame painter—‘cause he’s like the painter in two key ways: first, his work is a low-budget version of the truth, and second, he’s only vibing with the shallow corner of the soul. thus, it’s totally on point to boot him out of a well-run state—‘cause he’s all about hyping up wild feelings while wrecking real reason. just like a city where the shady peeps run the show and the good ones get sidelined, in a man’s soul this copycat poet sets up a toxic vibe, indulging an irrational side that can’t tell epic from meh—dude’s basically a factory for shallow images, far removed from any real truth.

deadass, exactly.

but yo, we ain’t even dropped our heaviest burn yet: the fact that poetry can straight-up mess with even the top-tier peeps (and, fr, hardly anyone is spared), is mad savage.

yeah, no cap, if that’s the real spill, it’s hella scary.

check this: the dopest among us, when we vibe with a Homer drop or a tragic tearjerker where some pitiful hero is all over his feels—crying, smacking his chest, the whole dramatic deal—we get mad emotional, and we’re like, “yo, big props to that poet for hitin’ our heartstrings!”

yeah, obviously, i get it.

but yo, when we catch our own drama, suddenly we flex the opposite vibe—we wanna be all quiet and hold it down like true OGs; that weepy side that got us hyped in the recitation is now treated as, like, extra wimpy or even a girl thing, no cap.

facts, he agreed.

so can we really be down with someone who’s flaunting what we’d all be lowkey ashamed to do ourselves?

nah, he was like, “that just ain’t it, bro.”

i fired back, “nah fam, from one angle it does seem kinda reasonable.”

what angle though?

i was like, “peep this: when misfortune hits, we naturally crave a good cry to ease the pain—but since we keep our own sadness on lockdown, poets come along and set it free. so our better nature—still not fully schooled by reason—lets that empathetic side break loose when the sorrow ain’t ours. and the audience, thinking there’s zero shame in boosting someone who spills their epic feels, sees it as a win. why be snobby and miss out on both the feels and the dope poem? hardly anyone thinks about how other peeps’ bad vibes might rub off on you and mess up your own mood.”

preach, that's so true!

and, real talk, the same goes for cringy jokes. there are memes you’d be too embarrassed to drop yourself, but when they hit on stage or even in private, you’re like, “lol, that’s hilarious,” without feeling grossed out by how out of line they are. just like with pity—our inner vibe used to be held down by reason ‘cause we didn’t wanna look like clowns, but then you end up channeling that wild humor at home, lowkey turning into your own comic poet.

facts, he agreed.

and honestly, the same goes for all our wild feels—lust, anger, desire, pain, pleasure—every move we make is drenched in these vibes. poetry is out here fueling and watering all that passion, instead of flipping the switch to shut it down. it basically lets the feels run the show, even though, if we wanna level up in happiness and virtue, they really should be reigned in.

i can’t argue with that.

so, glaucon, i said, whenever you run into those homer stan types preaching that homer is the ultimate teacher of hellas and his vibes are crucial for schooling us and running human affairs, let’s give props to those peeps—they’re solid as far as their wisdom goes; and yeah, we’re down with homer being the top poet and OG tragedy dropper. but we gotta be rock-solid on the idea that only god-hymns and shouts out to legends are the only kinda poetry that should be vibing in our state. ‘cause if we let that sweet, honey-coated muse crash in—whether in epic or lyrical form—then it’s not law and human reason running the show, but raw pleasure and pain will end up calling all the shots.

he was like, “preach, that's truth right there.”

and now that we’re back on the poetry track, let this our defense serve as proof that our earlier call to boot out that wild art from our state was totally on point—reason forced our hand, no cap. but so she doesn’t think we’re being all harsh and uncool, let’s drop that there’s been an ancient beef between philosophy and poetry; there are mad signs of it—like that “yelping hound howling at his lord,” or that dude “all might but full of petty buzz,” plus “the squad of sages dodging zeus,” and even “those sneaky thinkers who are just broke, period.” and honestly, there are countless throwbacks proving their old-school beef. still, let’s tell our sweet muse and the sidekick arts of imitation that if she can flex her creds and show she belongs in a well-run state, we’ll welcome her with open arms—we totally vibe with her charms; but we can’t just lie for the sake of it. i gotta say, glaucon, you’re lowkey as charmed by her as i am, especially when she drops up in homer, right?

yeah, i’m hella charmed, no doubt.

so, should we call for her comeback from exile, but only if she drops a lit self-defense in some fresh lyrical beat or something?

for sure.

plus, we can even let her non-poet wingmen—those poetry lovers who aren’t official poets—drop some prose on her behalf, proving not only that she’s all kinds of pleasant but also that she’s a real upgrade for states and human life, and we’ll vibe with that. ‘cause if poetry can be both a flex and a legit tool, we’re all in, right?

he was like, “facts, we’re definitely winning on that front.”

if her self-defense bombs, then listen, my dude: just like those who are totally smitten yet hold themselves back when their crush goes against their own best interests, we gotta, after some bittersweet struggle, let her go. we’re all fueled by that deep love for poetry that noble state vibes taught us, so we wanna see her drop her absolute best; but until she can nail her defense, our counter-argument will be our charm—something we’ll keep on replaying while her verses hit our ears—so we don’t slip into a childish infatuation that wrecks us all. bottom line: we know that the kind of poetry we dissed isn’t really about truth, and anyone who falls too hard for it, putting his inner city at risk, should ride our words as law, no cap.

he was like, “preach, i’m totally with you on that.”

i continued, “my dear glaucon, the stakes here are massive—way higher than they seem—whether a dude turns out good or bad. like, what’s the point if, under the hype of honor, cash, power, or even that poetry drip, he ghosts justice and virtue?”

he replied, “facts, i’m sold on that argument—i bet anyone would be, honestly.”

but yo, we haven’t even dropped the fact that virtue’s waiting for some next-level, epic rewards.

like, are there even bigger flexes? if so, they gotta be off the charts, beyond our wildest dreams.

i said, “dude, what’s ever been huge for a hot minute? three score years and ten is literally peanuts when stacked up against forever, no cap.”

he shot back, “more like nothing.”

and like, if you’re immortal, would you ever sweat that tiny blip instead of the entire eternity?

for sure, it’s the whole deal. but why you askin’, bro?

i reminded him, “aren’t you woke that a man’s soul is totally immortal and unbreakable, no cap?”

he peeped me in shock and was like, “no fr, for real—are you seriously gonna stand by that?”

i was like, “hella yes, i gotta—and so should you. proving it is a total breeze, trust.”

he was like, “i see some major hurdles here, but i’m tryna hear you drop that argument you make sound all chill about.”

alright, listen up.

i’m all ears.

so, there’s that thing you call good and another you call evil, right?

he was like, “yep, that’s the tea.”

you down with the idea that the stuff that corrupts and wrecks is evil, while the energy that saves and uplifts is good?

yeah, for sure.

and you’re cool with the notion that every single thing has both a good and a bad side? like, ophthalmia is the bad side for the eyes and a gnarly disease for the whole body; mildew messes up corn, rot wrecks timber, and rust fries copper and iron—basically, almost everything carries its own built-in decay and bad vibes, right?

facts.

and anything that catches these toxic vibes is doomed to go full evil and eventually fizzles out, yeah?

true, indeed.

basically, the inner vice inherent in each thing is what leads to its own downfall; and if that doesn’t crush it, nothing else will—‘cause good ain’t gonna destroy it, and neither will some neutral blah that isn’t even good or evil.

definitely not.

so if we find something that, despite its built-in corruption, just won’t break down or vanish, then we gotta say that nature’s basically immune to destruction, right?

we can assume that, for sure.

well, i said, “but what about the soul—doesn’t any evil mess it up?”

he replied, “yup, all those bad vibes we just dropped—unrighteousness, overindulgence, basic cowardice, ignorance—are in the mix.”

but do any of those actually dissolve or destroy the soul?—and don’t get us twisted into thinking that a shady, clueless dude, when busted, just crumbles under his own injustice, which is a deep soul-level evil. think about the body: its intrinsic evil is like a disease that totally rots and annihilates it; everything we mentioned eventually self-destructs through its own built-in corruption. ain’t that the real tea?

yep, you got it.

now, apply that same logic to the soul. does the injustice or any other bad vibe inherent in the soul slowly consume it—cling onto it so hard that, eventually, it brings about its own death and splits it from the body?

definitely not, no way.

but then, i said, it’s just cray to think that something can be wiped out by an external bad vibe if it couldn’t also self-destruct from its own inner corruption, right?

he shot back, “yeah, that makes sense.”

i said, “glaucon, peep this: even if your food’s all stale or rotten, if that bad vibe stays locked in the food, it’s not gonna straight-up destroy your body. but if that grossness spreads corruption into you, then your body’s basically wrecked by its own disease. however, to claim that your body (one entity) can be destroyed by food’s bad quality (a completely separate entity) that doesn’t even naturally infect you? nah, we’re absolutely not buying that.”

true that.

and along those lines, unless some physical baddie can trigger a soul-level evil, we can’t say that the soul—being its own whole vibe—gets dissolved by any mere external nastiness from another source, right?

he was like, “facts, i feel that.”

so either we crush this conclusion, or, until it’s busted, we must never claim that fever, any other disease, a knife to the throat, or even slicing your whole body to bits, can destroy the soul—unless it turns out that the soul itself becomes extra unholy or unrighteous because of it. basically, no one should say that something external can kill the soul if it isn’t already wrecking it from the inside.

and he added, “and for real, no one can prove that a man’s soul turns extra shady after death.”

but if some person, refusing to admit that the soul is immortal, goes off and says that the dying actually become even more evil and unrighteous, then—if they’re right—we’d have to roll with the idea that injustice, like a nasty virus, is lethal to the crooked, and those who carry that mess end up getting iced by their own inherent destructive power. though, this would go down in a way totally different from how the wicked currently get clapped by others as payback for their moves.

nah, he shot back, “if injustice kills the crooked, it ain’t that brutal for them—they basically get freed from evil. i actually suspect it’s the opposite: that injustice, if it’s got the power, will end up murdering others and keep the murderer alive—yeah, even wide awake; his crib is nothing like a house of death.”

i agreed, “true; if the soul’s built-in bad vibes can’t kill it, then whatever’s meant to destroy one body can’t wipe out a soul or anything else that isn’t meant to be destroyed, no cap.”

he was like, “yeah, that’s mad unlikely.”

so, since the soul can’t be destroyed by any evil—whether from within or without—it’s gotta exist forever, right? and if it lasts forever, it’s totally immortal.

certainly, for real.

that’s the verdict, i said; and if that’s on point, then the number of souls stays constant—none vanish, so they won’t shrink in count. nor will they suddenly multiply, ‘cause any increase in these immortal vibes would have to come from something mortal, meaning that everything would eventually be set in immortality.

facts, very true.

but yo, we can’t really believe that—reason won’t let us—any more than we can believe the soul, in its pure form, is a mishmash of random, clashing elements.

he asked, “what are you on about, bro?”

i explained, “the soul, since it’s certified immortal, has gotta be the ultimate masterpiece—it can’t be a cheezed-up collage of random parts, right?”

he quipped, “nah, for real.”

her immortality is already proven by what we just laid down, and there’s a truckload of proofs on deck; but to peep the soul as it REALLY is—not like the messy version we see now, wrecked by its hookup with the body and all those miseries—you gotta view it through the lens of pure reason, in its pristine, original drip. then, its true beauty, along with all the deets about justice, injustice, and everything else, will pop off clear as day. so far, we’ve been real about how the soul shows up today, but remember: we’re only seeing it like a sea god that’s been battered—like glaucus, whose original glow is nearly hidden ‘cause his parts got smashed, crusted over with seaweed, shells, and stones, turning him into a total monster compared to his true form. our soul’s looking the same—janky and marred by a bazillion ills. but not there, glaucon, not there is where we gotta fix our gaze.

so, where do we even look for it then?

at her big brain love of wisdom. let’s peep who she’s vibing with and what squad and convos she’s chasing ‘cause of her next-level connection with the immortal, eternal, and divine—no cap. also, imagine how she’d totally glow up if she went full boss mode and followed that superior principle, yeeting herself outta the ocean she’s chillin’ in rn and ghosting all the basic stones, shells, and rocky trash that surround her ‘cause she’s been munching on that basic earth food and getting overgrown by the so-called good things of this life. then, fam, you’d see her for real and know if she’s rocking one flex or a whole emoji set of shapes, and what her true nature is. i think we’ve dropped enough tea about her feels and the forms she takes in this current vibe.

true, he replied.

and thus, i said, we’ve totally aced the rules of this debate; we didn’t even flex those rewards and glories of justice you mentioned from homer and hesiod—but justice, in her own vibe, proved to be the ultimate cheat code for a baller soul. let any dude flex his just moves, whether he’s rocking the ring of gyges or not, and even if he goes extra by putting on hades’ helmet. 

for real.

and now, glaucon, no cap, there’s zero harm in me breaking down just how massive the rewards are that justice (and the whole squad of virtues) hooks up the soul with—from gods and mortals, both irl and in the afterlife.

certainly not, he said.

so, yo, will you pay back what you borrowed in our debate?

what did i borrow?

i mean, the idea that a just dude should sometimes look sus while the shady ones look lit—‘cause you were vibing that even if the real tea can’t hide from the all-seeing gods and humans, we still gotta throw in that assumption for the argument’s sake, so that pure justice can be weighed against pure injustice. remember that?

i’d be mad salty if i forgot.

so, since the verdict’s in, i’m officially calling—on justice’s behalf—that the mad props and clout due to her, as recognized by gods and mortals alike, should be handed back to her by us. since she’s proven to give off real vibes and isn’t here to catfish those who truly possess her, let all the credit that was snatched be returned, so she can flex that signature win of appearance that’s totally hers, and which she naturally gives to her own crew.

bet, he said, that demand is straight up just.

first things first, i said—and that’s like the first loot you gotta return—the vibe of both the just and the shady is 100% known to the gods.

granted.

and if both crews are on the gods’ follow list, then obviously one squad is the gods’ ride-or-die while the other’s straight-up beef, just like we lowkey agreed from the jump?

true.

and the gods’ bestie is assumed to score all the prime perks, minus only the necessary bad vibes that come as a follow-up to past misdeeds, right?

certainly.

so this must be our idea of a just dude: even when he’s broke, sick, or facing any rough patch, the universe will eventually squad up to bless him in life and even in death—‘cause the gods only stan anyone hustling to hit that divine, godlike vibe by chasing virtue. bet?

yeah, he replied; if a dude’s flexing god-level vibes, the big guy won’t ghost him.

and for the shady ones, shouldn’t it be the opposite vibe?

certainly.

so these are the epic victory vibes—the palms of victory—that the gods drop on the just, right?

that’s my conviction, no cap.

and what about what they snag from mortals? check it: the sly, shady ones are like runners who smash the sprint from start to finish but then dip, ending up looking like total memes—slinking away with droopy ears and zero crown flex—whereas the real mvp runs all the way, secures the win, and gets crowned like a boss.

no cap, true.

and now, let me rehash the blessings for the just that you were mistakenly tossing to those “fortunate” unjust peeps. i’ll say the same as you did for the others: as they mature, they can totally boss up in their own city if they’re feeling it; they marry whoever they want and hand out unions like free merch; everything you said about the others, i now say about these homies.

on the flip side, the shady crew—even if they dodge heat in their youth—eventually get exposed as total clowns and end up looking mad cringe by the endgame. when they grow old and miserable, both random strangers and insiders roast them; they get rekt and then receive savage disses that are anything but polite, as you pointed out; they’ll be tortured and even have their peepers burned out, just like you dropped.

and yo, you can assume i recapped the rest of your horror scroll, right? can i just trust these deets are legit true?

certainly, he said; what you say is totally on point.

these, then, are the prizes, rewards, and goodies that gods and humans serve up to the just in this lifetime, besides the other lit perks that justice herself delivers.

yeah, he said—and they’re all that and a bag of chips, lasting forever.

but still, i said, these rewards are basically peanuts next to the epic recompenses waiting for both the just and the unjust after death. and yo, you need to listen, ‘cause then both squads get full payment on our debate’s tab.

speak up, he said; there’s so little i’d rather jam to.

well, i said, let me drop a tale—not one of those odysseus sagas for alcinous, but a hero story about er, the son of armenius, a legit pamphylian OG. he got clapped in battle, and ten days later, when the bodies were already rotting, his body was found fresh and totally immune to decay, then yeeted home for a proper burial. and on day twelve, while he was chillin’ on the funeral pyre, boom—he respawned and spilled all the tea about what he peeped in the other realm.

he said that when his soul dipped out of his body, it hit a journey with a major squad, and they rolled up to this mysterious spot with two savage openings in the earth—side by side—and right across, there were two other vibes opening up in the heavens above.

in that in-between zone, judges were posted, dishing out verdicts to the just and slapping on their sentences right then and there, ordering them to ascend on the heavenly right-hand lane; while the unjust got summoned to slide down the lower left-hand path—and these peeps were sporting symbols of their deeds, strapped to their backs like some cringe accessory.

er rolled up, and the judge squad told him he was the messenger— the ultimate reporter—to drop the tea of the afterlife to humankind, and they commanded him to soak in every bit of deets meant to be peeped in that space.

then he peeped that on one side, souls were bouncing out of both the heaven and earth openings once their sentences were dropped; and on the other two, he spotted other souls—some coming up from the earth all dusty and worn from the grind, while others descended from the heavens, sparkling and super clean.

regularly, these souls rolled in from long, epic journeys and hit up a chill meadow like it was a lit festival—setting up camp and vibing. those who were old pals embraced and swapped stories, with the earth crew straight-up nosy about the heavenly vibes and the heaven squad curious about what’s going down below.

they traded the tea on their journeys—those from below weeping and spilling feels over all the dark stuff they endured on a thousand-year underworld trek, while those from above flexed stories of divine delights and visuals so unreal, they were straight-up next-level.

but, glaucon, this tale is epic AF, so tl;dr: for every savage wrong dished out, a soul got hit with a tenfold smackdown—like every 100 years (a human lifetime style) gets multiplied by ten in a thousand years.

like, if you cause a massacre, flip on your squad, enslave cities or armies, or commit any other savage moves, every offense gets a tenfold punishment, and the rewards for beneficence, justice, and holiness are stacked in the same ratio—no cap.

i won’t even rehash the tea about toddlers dying almost on spawn. regarding piety versus impiety to gods and parents, and for murderers, there were even more brutal paybacks he laid out—next-level horror, fr.

he dropped that he was there when one spirit hit up another, asking, "yo, where’s ardiaeus the great?" (and btw, ardiaeus lived a thousand years before er—this dude was a tyrant in some pamphylian city, offed his old man and elder bro, and dropped a load of other hella cringy crimes).

the other spirit clapped back, "he ain’t coming here and never will. and yo, this was one of the most savage scenes we witnessed. we were posted at the cavern’s mouth, about to ascend after wrapping up our experiences, when suddenly ardiaeus and a crew—mostly tyrants plus some notorious criminal NFTs—popped up. they were all set to bounce to the upper world, but the cavern entrance, instead of letting them slide, dropped a mega roar every time one of these incurable sinners or someone who hadn’t been schooled enough in justice tried to level up. then, these wild, fiery dudes standing by caught the roar, grabbed them head to toe, dropped them, flayed them with whips, and dragged them along the road like wool being carded on thorns—while announcing to everyone their epic crimes and that they were being hauled straight down to hell."

and of all the terrors they suffered, he noted that nothing hit as hard as the sheer panic each one felt in that moment, just scared of catching that dreaded voice; but once everything went silent, one by one, they ascended with crazy joy.

these, er said, were the brutal penalties and retributions—and trust, the blessings were equally massive.

after the spirit squad kicked it in the meadow for seven whole days, on day eight they were forced to bounce on their journey; and on day four after that, er said they rolled up to a spot where, from above, they peeped a straight-up column of light running through all of heaven and earth, in a color vibe that screamed rainbow—but way brighter and purer.

a day later, they reached a place where, smack dab in the middle of that glow, they spotted the ends of chains dangling down from heaven; ‘cause this light is basically heaven’s belt that holds the entire universe together like the undergirders of an epic trireme.

from these endpoints extends the spindle of necessity—the central axle where all cosmic revolutions turn. its shaft and hook are forged in steel, and the whorl is a mix of steel and other fly materials.

the whorl itself is shaped like the ones we peep on earth; the lowdown being there’s one big, hollow, scooped-out whorl, and nested inside are another, then another, and four more—making eight in total, kind of like nested vessels that slide perfectly into one another. the top edges of these whorls pop, and their bottom edges all merge into one continuous circle. right through the center of the eighth whorl, the spindle is jammed home.

here’s the lowkey math: the outermost whorl’s got the fattest rim, and the seven inner rings are scaled down as follows—the sixth is almost as big as the first, with the fourth snug next to it; then the eighth shows up; the seventh comes in as a fifth, the fifth as a sixth, the third slots in as seventh, and finally the second wraps it up as the eighth. cosmic geometry on fleek.

the largest—aka the fixed stars—is blinged out and spangled, and the seventh, which is the sun, is the brightest flex. the eighth, or the moon, gets its color from bouncing off the sun’s glow; the second and fifth—saturn and mercury—vibe together with a yellow drip that’s even more lit than the previous, while the third, venus, shines with the whitest glow; the fourth, mars, rocks a reddish tone; and the sixth, jupiter, is a close second in brightness with that white glow.

the entire spindle spins together, but while the whole rig rotates in one direction, the seven inner circles are lowkey moonwalking in the opposite lane. among these, the eighth is the speediest; next up, the seventh, sixth, and fifth groove in sync; then the fourth clutches third place in this reversed hustle; the third shows up as fourth, and the second slides in as fifth. total cosmic tik-tok vibes.

the spindle pivots on necessity’s knees, and on each circle’s top, a siren spins along, dropping that one sick note on loop like a one-track anthem.

all eight circles vibe together into one dope harmony; and equally spaced around, there’s a trio sitting on their thrones—the fates, daughters of necessity, rocking white robes and killer chaplets: lachesis, clotho, and atropos. they harmonize with the sirens’ loop, with lachesis belting out the past, clotho representing the present, and atropos forecasting the future; sometimes clotho gives a right-hand nudge to the outer circle’s spin while atropos guides the inner ones with her left, and lachesis swaps between them. total cosmic dj set, fr.

when er and the spirit crew arrived, their duty was to hit up lachesis immediately; but first, a prophet rolled in, lined everyone up, grabbed lots and life samples from lachesis’s knees, then hopped on a high pulpit and clapped: “hear the word of lachesis, daughter of necessity. mortal souls, check it: a brand-new cycle of life and death is dropping. your genius won’t be handed to you on a silver platter—you get to choose your own vibe. whoever draws the first lot scores first pick, and the life they choose becomes their destiny. virtue is totally free, and as you honor or diss it, you’ll get more or less of it; the choice is on you—and god is totally justified.”

once the interpreter dropped that wisdom, he scrambled the lots all around without any favoritism, and every soul snagged the lot that landed nearest—everyone except er (nothin’ for you, bro)—and as each peep grabbed their lot, they noticed the number they’d landed on.

then the interpreter laid out on the ground a whole spread of life samples. omg, there were way more lives than souls in the room, covering every vibe imaginable. there were lives for every creature and every type of human condition. you had tyrants whose reign lasted their whole life and others who flopped mid-course, ending in poverty, exile, and zero clout; there were lives of famous dudes—some known for their swag, beauty, strength, game wins, or lit family lineage, and others who were famous for being exactly the opposite. and women? same deal. no one fixed character, ‘cause each soul picks up a remix when starting a new life. every possible quality was there, all mixed up with wealth and poverty, health and disease, plus those basic average states.

and look, my dear glaucon, this is the supreme peril of our human state; so we gotta be hella careful. let each one of us ditch all that extra noise and focus on learning one thing only—if we can find someone who helps us level up our ability to tell good from evil—so that we can always, no cap, choose the better life whenever a shot comes our way.

he’s gotta analyze how all these factors impact virtue; figure out how beauty flexes when it’s meshed with poverty or wealth in a soul, and weigh the good and bad spills from being born noble versus humble, or from living a private life versus being in the public eye, from strength versus weakness, smarts versus dullness, and all the natural and earned gifts of the soul when they vibe together; then, by scoping out the nature of the soul with all these qualities, he can decide what’s lit and what’s trash—naming the life that darkens his soul “evil” and the one that brightens it “good,” while benching all the rest.

coz we’ve peeped and know that this is the dopest choice for both life and the afterparty after death.

so a dude must roll into the next world with an unbreakable, adamantine faith in truth and decency, so he isn’t dazzled by greedy vibes or any other shady lures of evil; otherwise, when stumbling into tyrannies and similar BS, he might end up dishing out irreversible wrongs on others (and get hit even harder himself). instead, he should learn to ride the middle lane and dodge all extreme cray vibes—not just in this life, but in every life that’s to come. that, my friend, is the true way to happiness.

and according to the deets from the messenger from the other world, this was what the prophet dropped at the time: ‘even for the last comer, if he picks wisely and grinds hard, a hella lit and chill life is on deck. so, the one who grabs first better not act like a scrub, and the last one, don’t hit that despair mode.’

and after the prophet finished his hot take, the first in line slid up and, in a sec, snatched the absolute wildest tyranny; his mind was totally clouded by dumb vibes and over-the-top sensuality, so he never really scoped out the sitch before his pick—and he straight-up missed that fate had him, among other epic fails, destined to chow down on his own kiddos.

but once he got some chill time to reflect and peep his lot, he started smacking his chest and throwing mad regret over his choice, completely ghosting on the prophet’s forecast; instead of owning up to his epic flop, he went off on chance, the gods, and literally everyone else instead of himself.

now this dude was one of those who hailed from heaven, having once vibed in a super well-ordered state in his past life, but his virtue was nothing more than autopilot routine, and he had zero philosophy.

and the same went for other peeps who got similarly wrecked—most of them were sky born and never got schooled by the real-life grind, while the earth squad, who had suffered and peeped others’ pain, took their sweet time before choosing.

and thanks to their rookie status plus the fact that the lot was totally random, many souls ended up swapping a fire destiny for a straight-up dumpster fire, or vice versa.

because if a dude had been all about sound philosophy from the moment he dropped into this world, and if his lot numbers were on fleek, then—as the messenger posted—he’d be chill and happy in the now, and his journey to the next life (and back) wouldn’t be all rough and underground but smooth and heavenly instead.

the most sus part, he said, was the spectacle—sad, laughable, and straight-up bizarre; since most soul picks were based on receipts from their past lives.

there he peeped the soul that used to be orpheus, choosing the life of a swan purely outta beef with the race of women—hating being born a woman since they were his ultimate haters; he also scoped thamyras’s soul, which flipped into the nightingale life; meanwhile, birds like the swan and other musical legends were lowkey tryna level up and be human.

the soul that landed the twentieth lot opted for lion life, and that was ajax, son of telamon, who straight-up refused to vibe as a man, still repping the sting from that shady arms verdict injustice.

next up was agamemnon, who grabbed eagle life—’cause, just like ajax, he was hella done with human nature thanks to all his deep suffering.

midway through, atalanta’s lot came up; peeping the sick flex of an athlete’s fame, she couldn’t resist the temptation and locked in that life. right after her, epeus, son of panopeus, flipped into the vibe of a savvy woman in the arts; and way down at the tail end, the jester thersites went full monkey mode.

odysseus’s soul also rolled in, still waiting to pick, and his lot ended up being the very last in the lineup. having caught all the feels from past toils, he got totally disenchanted with grand ambitions and spent ages scouring for that chill, no-drama private life vibe; he struggled to find it since it was ghosted by everyone else, but once he peeped it, he was like, “bet, i’d be down for that same choice even if mine came first,” and he was super stoked to lock it in.

and not just did humans morph into animals, but also—gotta spill the tea—tame and wild critters were swapping forms with each other and flipping into their matching human vibes; the good turning into the gentle and the evil going full savage, in literally every remix combo.

all the souls had locked in their life choices, and bouncing in that same order, they rolled over to Lachesis, who dispatched the genius each had picked to be the guardian of their new vibe and the plug for their destiny: this genius led the squad first to Clotho, who spun them up in her dope spindle rotation, locking in each fate; then, once they were strapped in, carried them over to Atropos, who spun the threads and made ‘em irreversible—no do-overs—so that without a pause they slid under the throne of Necessity; and when they’d all passed through, they trekked in a fire-hot march to the plain of forgetfulness, a barren zone with zero trees or lush vibes; later, as night fell, they set up camp by the river of unmindfulness, whose water no cup can ever hold; each one was forced to sip a fixed amount—and those not blessed with wisdom ended up chugging extra—and with every swig, they straight-up yeeted all their memories.

after they crashed, right in the dead middle of the night a wild thunderstorm and epic earthquake dropped hard, and in a flash they were yeeted upward in a million ways, like dope shooting stars. but fam, one dude got totally blocked from sipping the water. and how or why he got zipped back to his body, he couldn’t even spill; all he knew was that when he woke up in the morning, he found himself chillin’ on the pyre.

and so, Glaucon, the saga’s been saved from total deletion and will rescue us if we vibe with the prophet’s word; we’ll cruise safely over the river of forgetfulness with our souls staying untainted. that’s why my pro-tip is to always ride the heavenly wave and chase justice and virtue on the daily, ’cause the soul’s immortal and built to flex through every kind of epic good and wild evil. this way, we’ll keep it squad-goals with each other and with the gods—whether we’re kickin’ it here now or, like all-star gamers circling to grab loot, when we finally bag our reward. it’s gonna be all good in this life and on that epic thousand-year pilgrimage we’ve been chatting about.
