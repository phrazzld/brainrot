book ix.

last of all comes the tyrannical man; now, we gotta ask again, how is he molded from democrat vibes, and does he live in joy or pure misery?
yes, he said, he's the one remaining.

but i said, there's a past question still left hanging.
what question though?

i don't think we've properly scoped out the deets on how many and what types of cravings we got, and until that's locked down, our inquiry stays a hot mess.
well, he said, it ain't too late to fix that miss.

deadass, i said; peep this: i reckon some extra, unnecessary pleasures and cravings are totally unlawful. everyone’s got them, but for some peeps they're reined in by laws and sense so that the dope desires win—either they're totally banished or just chill and weak; while for others, they’re juiced up and in overload.
which appetites you mean?

i mean the ones that wake up when our rational vibe is asleep; then that wild inner beast, loaded with food or drink, shakes off sleep and bolts out to satisfy all its cravings—there’s literally no madness or crime (aside from incest, unnatural hookups, parricide, or snacking on forbidden eats) that someone, having yeeted all shame and sense away, wouldn’t be about to commit.
most true, he said.

but when a man's got a solid, chill pulse, and before crashing, he fires up his rational engine with noble, deep meditations—letting his cravings be just enough to lull them to sleep so they don't mess with his higher vibe, which he keeps in a pure, abstract mode to ponder the unknown (past, present, or future)—and once he's pacified the two wild impulses and then switches on reason before sleep, then, as you know, he's closest to the truth and dodges those wild, lawless visions.
i totally agree.

by the way, i might be digressing, but the key deet i wanna drop is that all of us—even the righteous—got a wild, unchained beast nature that sneaks out in sleep. reflect on that and let me know if you're vibing.
yes, i agree.

and now, remember that vibe we gave the democratic man. from day one, he was schooled by a tightwad parent who hyped saving the essentials but dissed all the extra, frivolous fun.
true.

and then he rolled with a finer, hedonistic crew, and fed up with his dad's cheapness, he spun all the way to the opposite extreme. eventually, being a stand-up guy compared to his shady influencers, he balanced between both extremes—living not a life of gross, slavish passion but one of moderately measured indulgence in various pleasures. and that's how the democrat was born out of the oligarch.
yes, he said; that was our take on him, and it holds up still.

and then, i said, fast forward some years, and picture this man having a son, raised with his old man’s principles.
i can picture him.

then imagine the same play happening to the son as it did with the father: he gets sucked into a wild, lawless life that his seducers hype up as "perfect liberty." meanwhile, his dad and his crew support his moderate cravings while the opposite squad backs the contrary ones. as soon as these shady, tyrant-building magicians sense their grip slipping, they cook up a master passion to implant in him—a sort of monstrous, winged drone vibe—that's the only way to describe him.
yes, he said, that's exactly how the tyrannical man is born.

and isn't that why, back in the day, love got nicknamed a tyrant?
i wouldn't be shocked.

further, i said, hasn't a wasted, drunk guy got that tyrant energy too?
he does.

and you know, a dude who's totally off his mental game will seriously believe he can boss not just men but even the gods.
that's exactly it.

and the tyrannical man, in the true sense, emerges when, under the push of nature or habit or both, he goes all out drunken, lustful, and passionate—o my friend, isn't that the tea?
assuredly.

such is the guy and such are his roots. next, how's he actually living?
suppose, like the peeps jokingly say, you were to spill the tea.

i imagine, i said, that the next chapter in his hustle is all feasts, epic parties, wild bacchanals, and courtesans—love basically being the boss in his heart, running all the drama in his soul.
that's for sure.

yes; and round the clock, wild desires stack up, formidable as heck, demanding hella attention.
they definitely are, he said.

and any revenue he scores gets dipped before you know it.
true.

then come the debts and the straight-up slashing of his property.
obviously.

when he's left with nada, won't his craving squad—crowding like raven chicks in a nest—be screamin' for sustenance; and spurred on by them, especially by love (the ultimate boss of cravings), he goes wild, scheming to defraud or despoil someone of their stash just to feed his hunger?
yes, that's totally the vibe.

he absolutely must get cash, any way possible, to dodge those brutal pains and pangs.
he must.

and as he's got a never-ending cascade of pleasures—new ones kicking out the old—being younger he'll claim he deserves more than his old folks, and if he’s already blown his share, he'll swipe a piece of theirs.
no doubt, he will.

and if his parents don't cave, he'll first try to cheat and fool them.
very true.

and if that flap fails, he'll pull the force move and plunder them.
yes, probably.

and if the old folks fight back for what's theirs, then what, bro? would the creature even have any remorse tyrannizing over his own parents?
nah, he said, he wouldn't feel any warmth toward his own folks.

but, oh heavens! adeimantus, because of some trendy, extra love for a random harlot (who’s totally non-essential), can you even believe he'd beat his own mom—his ancient, ride-or-die, essential connection—and put her under someone else’s thumb; or that, in a similar sitch, he'd do the same to his decrepit old dad—his first and most crucial mate—for some fresh, blooming youth who's bluntly non-essential?
yes, indeed, he said; i believe he’d totally do that.

truly then, i said, a tyrannical son is a weird blessing to his old folks.
he is indeed, he replied.

he first snatches their drip (property), and when that flex fails and his soul’s hive is buzzing with wild feels, he yeets into a crib or swipes the fits of some late-night wanderer; next up, he goes full savage on a temple. meanwhile, the old school opinions he had as a kid – the ones that dished out vibe checks on good and evil – get yeeted out by the freshly liberated squad now riding shotgun with love and repping its empire. back in his democratic days, when he was still chillin’ under the laws and his pops, these thoughts were only let loose in his sleep sesh. but now that love’s got him on lockdown, he’s always, even IRL, living that rare dream he used to catch only in his zzz’s; he’ll commit the dankest murder, munch on off-the-menu snacks, or pull any other cringe-worthy move. love is his ride-or-die dictator, ruling him like a boss and, being a king in his own right, leads him like a full-on tyrant runs a state – making him drop any reckless stunt to keep his vibe and squad, be they toxic outsiders sliding in or the inner circle he let go wild ‘cause they were lowkey evil themselves. aren’t we catching mad vibes of his lifestyle?

yup, he said.

if there are only a few of these clout-chasers in the state while the majority of the peeps are chill, they dip and end up as bodyguards or mercenary homies for another tyrant who probably needs them for a war; and if there’s no war, they just kick it at home, pulling off a bunch of petty mischief around the city.

what kind of mischief?

like, these dudes are the ultimate grabbers—thieves, break-in gangsters, wallet snatchers, boot-pirates, temple robbers, community man-stealers; and if they can even talk, they’ll flip into snitches, drop bogus tea, and take bribes.

a mini catalog of evils, even if the squad doing ’em is lowkey.

yeah, i said; but “small” and “big” are just comparisons, and all this chaos they drop on a state is nothing compared to what the tyrant is about. when this toxic crew and their followers start multiplying and get woke to their power, backed by the people’s hype, they pick the one with the most tyrant vibes deep in his soul, and crown him their boss.

yeah, he said, and that dude’s gonna be the ultimate tyrant.

if the peeps just roll with it, cool; but if they throw up resistance—as he started out by clapping his own parents—then, if he’s got the juice, he’ll smack them down, keeping his beloved fatherland or motherland (as the cretans would say) locked under his young crew he’s anointed as rulers and bosses. that, my friend, is the finale for his wild passions and cravings.

truly.

when these dudes are just private individuals before they snag power, that’s their basic vibe: they only roll with their own hype squad or their ready-made minions; and if they need something, they’re just as quick to bow down and serve—flashing all kinds of fake affection for a hot minute, only to ghost them once they get what they want.

for real.

they’re always either in boss mode or on slave duty, never real friends with anyone; a tyrant never gets to taste genuine freedom or legit friendship.

no cap.

and can we not just call these dudes straight-up backstabbers?

fr fr, no cap.

plus, they’re mad unjust, if our idea of justice is on point?

yeah, he said, and we nailed it.

so let’s sum it up in one word, i said, about the sketchiest dude: he’s like the real-life version of our wildest nightmares.

big facts.

this is the guy who, by nature, is practically built like a tyrant—and the older he gets, the more of a full-blown tyrant he turns out to be.

true af, said glaucon, stepping in to spill.

and won’t the one who’s proven to be the most savage also be the most miserable? the dude who’s been on that tyrant grind the longest is basically stuck in nonstop misery; even if most normies don’t see it that way.

yep, he said, deadass inevitable.

and gotta be that a tyrant man vibes just like a tyrant state, and a democratic man reflects the same in his city; the rest follow suit, right?

hella true.

and just like cities sync up on virtue and happiness, people relate on the same level?

for sure.

so, comparing our original city that was ruled by a king with one under a tyrant, where do they stand on the virtue scale?

they’re polar opposites, he said—one is lit AF while the other is straight-up trash.

no cap, i said, there’s zero confusion on who’s who; now i gotta ask—do you vibe the same on their overall levels of happiness and misery? and yo, we shouldn’t freak out when that tyrant dude shows up, even if he’s just one man with a couple of sidekicks; let’s go full detective mode, scope out every corner of the city, and then drop our verdict.

sounds like a solid invite, he replied; and i peep, like everyone does, that tyranny is the absolute lowest form of government, while a king’s reign is the peak of chill.

and when sizing up the homies too, can i throw in a similar request: i need a judge whose mind can deep dive into human nature—nobody like a kid getting shook by the flashy theatrics of tyrannical swagger, but someone with laser-sharp insight. can we assume that the verdict will be dropped in front of us by someone who’s lived with him, seen him in his everyday grind, watched him stripped of his tragic drip in family vibes, and again during public crises—so he can spill the tea on how the tyrant’s happiness stacks up against other dudes?

that’s a legit call, he said.

so, can we assume we’re seasoned enough to be judges, having met such a dude before? then we’ll have someone to break it all down for us.

deadass.

and yo, don’t forget the parallel between the individual and the state; with that in mind, swing your eyes between the two and tell me how they’re vibin’.

what do you mean? he asked.

starting with the city, i responded, would you say that a city ruled by a tyrant is free or totally locked down?

no lie, he said, no city is more completely enslaved.

but still, you see, aren’t there a few free peeps and some bosses in there?

yeah, he said, i peep a few—but overall, the peeps, even the top-tier, are seriously watered down and enslaved.

so, if a man is like his state, i said, shouldn’t the same vibe apply? his soul is jam-packed with pettiness and crassness—the dopest parts are locked away; and there’s a tiny ruling clique that’s also the most savage and insane.

straight up inevitable.

and would you say that this dude’s soul is that of a freed homie or of a slave?

in my opinion, he’s rocking a slave soul.

and the city under a tyrant, is it rich or lowkey broke?

def poor.

and a tyrant soul is always gonna be broke and craving more?

facts.

and isn’t that state—and that dude—constantly hella shook?

for sure.

is there any city out there with more crying, sorrow, moaning, and pain?

for real, nope.

and is there any dude who’s got more of this misery vibe than a full-on tyrant, all fired up with wild passions and cravings?

impossible, no cap.

after scoping out all this nasty drama, you’re saying the tyrant state is the most miserable of all states?

and i was right, he said.

deadass, i said. and when you spot the same ugliness in a tyrant dude, what do you say about him?

i say he’s without a doubt the most miserable dude ever.

and then i was like, hold up, i think you might be tripping a bit.

what are you saying?

i mean, i don’t think he’s hit peak misery just yet.

so, who in the squad is even more miserable?

i’m about to spill on that one.

who’s that?

the one who’s oozing tyrant vibes by nature and, instead of living a lowkey life, gets cursed with the extra drama of being a public tyrant.

from everything dropped, i gather you know what’s up.

yeah, i replied, but in this high-stakes debate you gotta be 100% sure, not just throwing wild guesses; because when it comes to the whole good vs. evil sitch, this is the ultimate flex.

big facts, he said.

so let me drop an example that might throw some light on the tea.

what’s your example?

peep the rich bosses in cities rolling with mad numbers of slaves: they paint a sick picture of a tyrant’s condition, ‘cause both have slaves—the only diff is, the tyrant just racks up more.

yeah, that’s the diff.

you know these bosses live secure and aren’t sweating about their crew?

what’s there to fear?

nothing, straight up. but notice why?

yeah; it’s 'cause the whole city is vibing together, each one watching out for the other.

big facts, i said. but imagine one of these masters—say he’s running a squad of fifty slaves along with his fam and all his assets—getting yeeted by a god into the wild with zero freemen to back him up. won’t he be straight-up terrified, thinking he, his wife, and his kids might get taken out by his own slaves?

yeah, he said, he would be in utter panic.

then the time comes when he’s forced to sweet-talk a bunch of his slaves, dropping mad promises of freedom and other goodies way against his will—basically, he’s gotta schmooze his own crew.

yeah, he said, that’s his only save.

and now, imagine that same god surrounds him with neighbors who aren’t about letting one dude boss another; if they catch the offender, they’d snatch his life, no joke.

then his situation goes from bad to epic loss, if you think he’s constantly surrounded and watched by haters.

isn’t that exactly the kind of prison a tyrant gets stuck in—this dude who, by nature, is loaded with fears and cravings? his soul’s delicate yet greedy, and on top of that, out of everyone in the city, he never gets to bounce or peep the cool stuff free folks chase, instead living locked in his cave like someone hiding in the crib, jealous of any citizen who steps out and finds something lit.

big facts, he said.

and with all that nasty drama, won’t the dude with trash self-rule—the tyrant man you just called the most miserable—be even more cringey when, instead of living his own life, fate forces him to be a public boss? having to rule others when he can’t even rule himself is like being a busted or broken-down homie forced to spend his days not vibing in peace but constantly throwing down with everyone.

yeah, he said, that comparison is on point.

isn’t his whole vibe utterly tragic? and doesn’t the real tyrant’s life suck majorly more than the one you already branded as the worst?

obviously.

the real tyrant, no matter what people say, is actually the ultimate slave—forced to lay on the flattery and servility, and to butter up even the crummiest humans. he’s got cravings he can never satisfy, always wanting more than anyone else, and is literally poor if you peep the whole soul: his life is an endless horror show of fear, convulsions, and chaotic distractions—just like the state he mirrors. and yo, that resemblance is deadass.

facts, he said.

furthermore, like we dropped earlier, the more power he gets, the worse he becomes: more jealous, more disloyal, more unjust, more friendless, more impious than he was before; he’s the OG dealer and hoarder of all kinds of vices, which means he’s supremely miserable and drags everyone else down with his toxic energy.

no smart homie would disagree with that drip.

so come on, i said, like a ref calling the final score in a play, do you also rank who’s #1 in happiness, who’s #2, and so on? there are five vibes overall—they’re the royal, timocratic, oligarchical, democratic, and tyrannical.

the verdict’s easy, he replied; they’ll roll out like choruses hittin’ the stage, and i gotta rate them in the order they drop, based on virtue vs. vice, happiness vs. misery.

do we even need a hype man, or should i just announce that the son of ariston (the best) has decreed that the most royal and just is also the happiest—that is, the dude who’s the ultimate boss of himself; and that the most trash and unjust is the most miserable, being the biggest self-tyrant and hence the biggest state tyrant?

speak it out yourself, he said.

and should i add, “whether seen or unseen by gods and men”?

yeah, add it.

then, i said, that’s our first piece of tea; and there’s another hint that drops some major cred.

what’s that?

the second proof comes from the nature of the soul: since we split the individual soul, just like the state, into three squads, that division gives us another sick flex.

what kind of division?

i reckon these three parts each roll with their own pleasure vibes; plus, they each have their own set of cravings and ruling energies.

what you mean exactly? he asked.

there’s one squad that vibes with learning, another that goes off in anger; and the third, coming in a bazillion forms, doesn’t have a fancy name but is just tagged as the “appetitive” squad—‘cause it’s charged with that extra oomph for eating, drinking, and all those sensual cravings; it’s also the money-hungry crew since these desires usually get fed with cash.

facts, he said.

if we say that the loves and pleasures of this third squad are all about chasing gain, then we can boil it down to one concept; and we’d clearly call that part of the soul all about money and gain.

i feel that, yeah.

and again, isn’t that fire element totally set on ruling, conquering, and snagging fame?

true.

if we call it the contentious or the ambitious—would that tag work?

hella suitable.

but on the flip side, everyone sees that the knowledge squad is all about the truth and couldn’t care less about clout or cash.

way less.

“lover of wisdom,” “lover of knowledge” are titles that totally fit that part of the soul, right?

certainly.

so we can kick it off by saying there are three types of peeps—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, and lovers of gain?

exactly.

and there are three separate flavors of pleasure, each aimed at its own vibe?

very true.

now, if you scope out these three types of peeps and ask each which life is the most lit, they’ll all be hyping their own while dissing the others: the money-maker will flex about how honour or learning is just vanity if it doesn’t bring in the cash, compared to the solid perks of gold and silver.

true, he replied.

and the honour-lover—what’s his take? won’t he call the pleasure of riches basic, while saying the pleasure of learning, if it doesn’t come with major props, is all smoke and mirrors?

very true.

and should we assume, i said, that the philosopher doesn’t even compare other pleasures with the joy of cracking the truth—living that constant quest for knowledge that’s practically heaven? doesn’t he say that if those other pleasures weren’t totally necessary, he’d just pass on ’em?

no doubt, he replied.

so since every class is debating its own pleasure—it's not about which life is higher in honour or strictly better, but which one is the most chill and pain-free—how do we know who’s dropping the real tea?

i honestly can’t say, he said.

so, what should be the gold standard? isn’t experience, wisdom, and reason the ultimate flex?

no bet, there ain’t nothing better, he said.

then, i said, think on this: among the three peeps, who’s clocked the most experience with all these pleasures? does the gain-chaser, even after trying to learn the real deal, know the pleasure of truth more than the philosopher knows the pleasure of stacking gains?

the philosopher, he replied, definitely has the upper hand; he’s been tasting all the flavors since he was a kid, whereas the gain-hustler, no matter how much he’s grinding, has hardly ever sampled—or even craved—the sweet drip of learning and truth.

so, the wisdom-lover has a massive flex over the gain-lover, ‘cause he’s got double the experience?

yup, mad advantages.

and again, does the honour vibe weigh more for one or does the wisdom squad drop the honour game harder?

nah, he said, all three get their props in line with what they chase; the rich, the brave, and the wise all pull in their own fans and get that honour, but the pure ecstasy of knowing true being is a vibe only the philosopher gets.

so his experience means he can judge way better than everyone?

def way better.

and he’s the only dude who’s rocking both wisdom and mad experience?

certainly.

plus, that very tool for judgment isn’t in the hands of the greedy or ambitious—it’s all in the philosopher’s kit.

which tool, bruh?

reason, the ultimate ride-or-die, where every decision should chill.

yeah.

and reasoning is totally his superpower, right?

totally.

if cash and gain were the measure, then the gain-lover’s shoutout would be the most on point?

assuredly.

or if it was all about honour or victory or courage then the ambitious or fighter’s call would be the truth?

clearly.

but since it’s experience, wisdom, and reason calling the shots—

the only takeaway, he replied, is that the pleasures blessed by the wisdom squad and reason are the real deal.

and so we land on the conclusion that the pleasure from the brainiac side of the soul is the ultimate vibe of all three, and that the one among us who runs with that energy lives the dopest life.

no doubt, he said—the wise homie always drops truth bombs when he gives a solid nod to his own life.

and what does our judge say is next in line for life and pleasure?

clearly, it’s the life of the soldier and honour-lover; that vibe’s way closer to his true self than the money-maker’s.

and last comes the gain-hustler?

true that, he said.

so twice in a row the just dude’s clapped the unjust in this showdown; and now comes the third trial, dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is 100% real and pure – every other pleasure is just a shadow play; and for real, that drop is gonna be the ultimate mic drop, right?

yeah, the biggest drop; but can you spill the deets?

i'm gonna break down this subject and you gonna drop your responses, no cap.

proceed.

so like, isn't pleasure just the opposite of pain?
true.

and there’s a chill midzone that's neither full-on pleasure nor straight-up pain?
bet, there is.

so you're saying it's like a dope in-between state—a legit soul chill zone where both extremes take a backseat?
yup.

you remember what peeps be saying when they're hella sick?
what do they say?

they be like, "real talk, nothing is as lit as being healthy." but low-key, they never peep that being healthy was the ultimate vibe until they got mad sick.
yep, i know, he said.

and when someone’s in intense pain, you’ve def heard them go, "yo, ditchin' that hurt is the ultimate glow-up," right?
i have.

and there’s mad other times when just chillin’—that pause from pain—is hyped as the peak pleasure, not some extra dope sensation?
yeah, he said; at that moment, they’re straight-up vibin' and content just to be at rest.

but then, when the pleasure ghosts, that kinda chill turns hella painful?
doubtless, he said.

so then this in-between rest is like a combo of pleasure and pain at once?
it would seem so.

but can something totally neutral flex as both sides at the same time?
nah, i gotta say, not.

and both pleasure and pain are major moves of the soul, right?
yep.

but what we just peeped—that neutral vibe—is straight-up rest, not motion, like a chill midpoint?
yeah.

so how can we be trippin’ in thinkin’ that no pain equals pleasure, or that no pleasure equals pain?
impossible.

so this whole scene is just an appearance—a flex of comparisons: rest looks like pleasure against pain, and pain looks extra harsh compared to pleasure; but when you test for real-deal pleasure, it’s all just bogus impositions, ya feel?
that's the inference.

peep the other squad of pleasures that roll in with zero prior pain, and you won’t keep thinkin’ that pleasure is merely cancelin’ pain or that pain is just the flip side of pleasure.
what be they, and where do i find 'em?

there’s a whole lit collection—like the pleasures of a dope scent; they hit you in a moment, no baggage of pain, and when they bounce, they leave zero hurt behind.
most true, he said.

so let’s not get played into thinkin’ that pure pleasure is just the end of pain, or that pain is simply the absence of pleasure.
no.

still, those extra wild and savage pleasures that hit the soul via the body are generally just major pain relievers, right?
that's true.

and when you're hyped about future vibes—whether good or bad—they’re on the same level?
yes.

shouldi drop an example of that vibe?
hit me up.

yo, you gotta agree that nature’s got an upper, a middle, and a lower zone, right?
i should.

and if someone hops from the lowest zone to the midzone, wouldn’t they think they’re leveling up; and if a dude chillin' in the midzone peeks at where he came from, he’d flex that he’s already upper-tier—even if he’s never peeped the true upper world?
for sure, he said; how could he think otherwise?

but if he gets dragged back down, he’d straight-up feel like he's descending?
no doubt.

all that just comes from bein’ clueless about the real upper, middle, and lower vibes?
yeah.

so can you be shook that peeps who are lowkey ignorant about the truth—and mess up on other stuff too—also end up with whack ideas about pleasure, pain, and that in-between state; so that when they’re drawn into pain they feel it heavy and think it’s the real deal, and when they bounce into the neutral zone they swear they’ve hit peak pleasure; they, not knowing true pleasure, end up comparing pain with no pain like mismatching shades—comparing black to grey instead of white—can you vibe with that?
no, indeed; i'd be even more shook if it were the other way around.

check it out: hunger, thirst, and the like are just the bodily state runnin' on empty, right?
yes.

and ignorance and dumb moves? they're the soul's low battery, true.
true.

and food and wisdom are the legit refills for each?
certainly.

so the satisfaction you get from what’s packing more real existence is way more on point than from something that’s lacking that vibe?
clearly, it’s from that which has more.

which squad, in your view, is loaded with more of that pure existence—the crew that includes food, drinks, condiments and all kinds of sustenance, or the squad that’s about real opinions, knowledge, mind vibes, and all kinds of virtue?
put it like this: which one’s got that ultra-pure being—one that’s about the unchanging, immortal, and true, or the one that’s all variable and mortal?
far purer, he replied, is the vibe of the unchanging squad.

and does the essence of that unchanging vibe flex as much knowledge as it does pure essence?
yes, it's on the same level.

and what about truth?
yes.

and conversely, if something’s lacking truth, it’s also low-key on essence?
necessarily.

so basically, stuff that’s all about the body has way less truth and essence than that which vibes for the soul?
heaps less.

and doesn’t even the body itself come up short on truth and essence compared to the soul?
yes.

whatever’s loaded with more real existence, that’s more mad filled than something with less real juice, right?
of course.

and if there's a lit pleasure in being filled with what’s natural, then the one more loaded with true being will genuinely enjoy that ultimate pleasure; whereas something that’s lacking real being will only catch some fake, flimsy pleasure.
unquestionably.

so those who ain't down with wisdom and virtue—and are always caught up in gluttony and nonstop sensuality—keep bouncing around in that midzone; in this area, they wander randomly through life, never making it to the true upper world; they don’t even peep its vibe, never getting filled with true being, and never tasting that pure, enduring pleasure. like a herd of cattle, with eyes always glued downward and heads stooped low (yup, fixated on the dining table), they get fat, feast, and breed, and in their obsessive love for these delights, they end up kickin' and buttin' each other with horns and iron hooves; they even off each other from their insatiable lust. for they pack themselves with stuff that’s unsubstantial, and the bit they fill up is also unsubstantial and hella unruly.

verily, socrates, said glaucon, you just dropped oracle-level truth about how most peeps live.
their pleasures are mixed with pain—how else would it go down? 'cause they're just weak shadows and sketches of the true, all tinted by contrasts that hype both the bright and the dark, implanting wild and insane desires in clueless minds; and they end up clashin' like stesichorus said that the greeks battled over helen's shadow at troy, all clueless about the real deal.
something like that’s bound to go down, inevitably.

and don't you think the same wild mess happens with the fiery, passionate element of the soul? like, the dude who channels his passion into action—whether he's envious and extra, violent and always beefin', or mad hot-headed and discontented—if he's out there chasin' clout, victory, and tryin' to let his anger run wild without reason or sense, then the same drama hits that spirited part too?
yes, he said, that's exactly it.

so then, can we confidently drop that the peeps who stan money and clout, when they chase their thrills with reason and knowledge on deck, and hustle to snag the real pleasures that wisdom shows them, will also score the truest, highest-level pleasures possible 'cause they're stickin' with truth; and they'll get the natural pleasures meant for them if what’s best for each is also the most natural to 'em?
yes, for sure; the best is the most natural.

and when the whole soul is vibin' on that philosophical wavelength, with no internal drama—each part doin' its own dope thang and flexin' the ultimate pleasures it's capable of?
exactly.

but when one of the other two principles takes over, it ends up failing to secure its own vibe and forces the rest to chase some ghostly, off-brand pleasure that's not even theirs?
true.

and the further you drift from philosophy and reason, the weirder and more illusive the pleasure becomes?
yes.

and clearly, what's furthest from reason is the one mad distanced from law and order?
clearly.

and the lusty, tyrannical desires are, as we peeped, at the far end?
yes.

and the royal, orderly vibes are the closest?
yes.

so the tyrant's locked in the deepest void from real, natural pleasure, and the king's riding the nearest wave?
certainly.

but if that's the tea, then the tyrant’s life is gonna be super cringey while the king’s life is mad pleasant?
inevitably.

you down to break down the measure of this gap between them?
will you break it down for me?

there appear to be three types of pleasure—one that's the real vibe and two that are bogus; now the tyrant’s level of transgression goes beyond the fake zone—he bails from the realm of law and reason, locking himself with these slave pleasures orbiting around him, and his inferiority can only be summed up as a number.
how do you mean?

i’m thinking that the tyrant sits in third place relative to the oligarch; and the democrat lands in the middle?
yes.

and if my logic's on point, then he'll be shackled to a pleasure image that's three times removed in truth from the oligarch’s vibe?
he will.

and the oligarch is third away from the royal, since we count royal and aristocratic as one squad?
yes, he’s third.

then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by a gap equal to three times three?
manifestly.

so the shadow of tyrannical pleasure, measured by that number, forms like a flat plane?
certainly.

and if you crank up the math and turn that plane into a solid, it's obvious how massive the gap is between the tyrant and the king.
yes; the arithmetician will totally nail the sum.

or if someone starts at the other end and measures how far the king is from the tyrant in true pleasure, they'll find that, after crunching the numbers, the king is livin' 729 times more lit, and the tyrant is sufferin' 729 times harder by that same margin.
what a wild calculation! and damn, how enormous is the gap that splits the just from the unjust in terms of pleasure and pain!
yet it's a legit computation, i said, with a number that nearly vibes with human life—if you think about days, nights, months, and years. (729 is almost the number of days and nights in a year, no cap.)

yeah, he said, human life is totally wrapped up in that.

then if the good, just dude is that way superior in pleasure compared to the evil, unjust one, his overall upgrade in livin'—in beauty, virtue, and proper vibes—will be off the charts?
immeasurably greater.

well, i said, and now that we’ve hit this level, let’s bounce back to what got us here: wasn't someone sayin’ that injustice actually scores a gain for those supposedly perfectly unjust peeps who are seen as just?
yes, that was said.

now then, having scoped out the power and drip of justice versus injustice, let’s slide into a little chat with that dude.
what should we say to him?

let’s whip up a dope mental image of the soul, so he gets his own vibe right in front of his eyes.
what kinda vibe?

an idealized image of the soul, like those composite creatures from ancient myth—think chimera, scylla, or cerberus, plus a ton more where different natures fuse into one epic beast.
word is, those unions went down.

so now, flex a model of a many-headed monster—a beast with a ring of heads of all kinds, tame and wild—that he can spawn and morph on a whim.
you assume the artist’s got epic powers; but since language is way more flexible than wax, let there be such a model as you propose.

now imagine you craft a second form in the likeness of a lion, and a third as a man—the lion being smaller than the beast form, and the man even smaller than the lion.
that's an easier flex, he said; and i did it just like you said.

and now merge 'em, letting the three grow into one epic fusion.
that's been accomplished.

next, shape their outer layer into one single image—as if it were just a man—so that anyone who can only peep the surface ends up thinking the beast is one human creature.
i've done that, he said.

and now, to the dude who claims it's profiting for a human to be unjust and that being just is a loss, let's clap back and say: if you're right, then it's like this creature's feasting on that many-headed monster and beefin' up the lion vibes, while leavin' the inner man starved and weak—making him liable to get wrecked by either squad; and he ain't tryna harmonize 'em, but rather letting them clash, bite, and devour each other.
certainly, he said; that's exactly what the injustice aprover preaches.

to that, the justice supporter fires back that the dude should always speak and act to give the inner man total mastery over the entire self. he should keep watch over that many-headed monster like a top-tier husbandman, nurturing the chill, gentle qualities and blocking the wild ones from blowin' up; he should squad up with that lion-heart and unite all the parts with one another and with himself.
yes, he said—that's precisely what the maintainer of justice says.

and so, from every angle—whether in terms of pleasure, clout, or straight-up gains—the one backing justice is on point and droppin' truth, while the one dissing it is off-base, bogus, and clueless?
yes, from every angle.

come on, now, let's gently reason with the unjust dude, who ain't intentionally messin' up. "sweet sir," we say, "what's your take on things deemed noble versus ignoble? isn't the noble that which keeps the beast in check with the man—or rather, channels that god-like spark within the man; and the ignoble that which turns the man into a full-on beast?"
he can hardly dodge sayin' yes—can he?
not if he even gives a damn about my opinion.

but if he’s vibin’ with that so far, then ask him: "then how does a dude profit if he gets gold and silver on the deal that he must enslave his noblest self to the worst vibes? who in their right mind thinks that a man who sells his own son or daughter into slavery for cash—especially droppin' them into the hands of fierce, evil peeps—comes out a gainer, no matter how fat the sum? and can anyone not call him a miserable caitiff, cold-heartedly sellin' his divine spark to the most godless, detestable force? eriphyle snagged that necklace as the price for her hubby’s life, but this dude’s takin' bribes to wrench a far worse ruin."
yes, said glaucon, far worse—i'll answer on his behalf.

hasn't the overindulgent been roasted since way back for letting that huge, multiform monster run unchecked?
clearly.

and don't dudes get slammed for their pride and short fuse when their lion and serpent vibes go into overdrive?
yes.

and luxury and softness get trashed because they chill out and weaken that same creature, turnin' a strong vibe into a total wuss?
very true.

and isn't a dude called out for being all fake and petty when he subordinates his spirited animal to that unruly monster, and—mad obsessed with cash, which he can never have enough of—trains it in his youth to get trampled in the mire, flipping it from lion mode to straight-up monkey?
true, he said.

and why are low-key, manual hustles looked down on? it's only 'cause they hint at a natural weakness in the higher principle; the individual can't control the wild inner creatures and ends up havin' to cozy up to 'em, making his whole grind about buttering 'em up.
such appears to be the reason.

and therefore, if we're tryna place him under a rule by the best, we say he ought to be the servant of the best—in whom the divine vibes rule; not, as thrasymachus supposed, to hurt the servant, but 'cause everyone should be ruled by that divine wisdom chillin' inside them; or, if that's a no-go, then by some external authority so that we can all roll under the same government, as friends and equals.
true, he said.

and it's hella clear that this is what the law's about—the city's ride-or-die ally; it's also seen in the authority we hold over kids, not lettin' them run wild until we've instilled in 'em a principle similar to the state’s constitution, and by nurturing that higher element, we set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own—and once that's solid, they can bounce on their own.
yes, he said, the law’s purpose is manifest.

so, from what angle or ground can we say a dude profits from injustice, intemperance, or any base trash that only makes him a worse human—even if he snags cash or power through his shady ways?
from absolutely no angle.

what’s he gonna gain if his shady moves fly under the radar and go unpunished? the dude who stays undetected only gets worse, while the one who gets caught and slammed gets his brutal side silenced and humanized; his gentler vibe is set free, and his whole soul gets leveled up and ennobled by snagging justice, temperance, and wisdom—way more than the body ever does from pickin' up beauty, strength, and health, proportional to how honourable the soul is compared to the body.
certainly, he said.

for this nobler vibe, the wise dude devotes his entire energy. and first up, he’s gonna stan the studies that impress these fly qualities on his soul while dissing the rest.
clearly, he said.

next, he’s gonna regulate his bod’s habits and training so he stays so far from yieldin’ to brutal, irrational pleasures that even health becomes a secondary flex; his main move isn’t just to be fine-looking, strong, or healthy—unless that levels him up in temperance—but he’ll always work to sync his body to keep his soul in perfect harmony.
certainly he will, if his inner music is straight fire.

and when it comes to stackin’ cash, there’s a vibe of order and harmony he’s gonna observe; he won’t let the world's foolish claps blind him and pile up riches to his own infinite harm.
certainly not, he said.

he’s gonna peep the inner city within him and make damn sure no chaos—whether from excess or scarcity—messes with it; and based on that, he’ll manage his property, gain, or spend strictly by his means.
very true.

and for the same reason, he’ll gladly accept and vibe with honors that he thinks make him a better dude; but any honors, whether private or public, that might mess up his flow, he’ll straight-up ghost.

then, if that is his motive, he ain't gonna be no legit statesman.

by the dog of egypt, he def will! in his own crib he’s totally the boss, though back in his hometown he might not flex—unless he’s hit with a divine call, no cap.

i feel you; you mean he’ll be the ruler of that city we built from scratch—a city that exists only as a pure idea—'cause i seriously don’t think such a homie ever roamed the real world.

in heaven, i replied, there’s this dope template laid out, so anyone with the drive can peep it and get their own house game in order. but whether that blueprint pops off in real-life or stays forever a vibe? honestly, it don’t matter; he’s gonna live that city life, ghosting all other cliques.

bet, he said.
