book x.

among all the fire qualities i peep in our state’s design, nothin’ slaps harder than our savage rule on poetry.

what you even tryna say?

i’m talkin’ ‘bout snubbin’ all that copycat, imitative poetry that just ain’t worth your time—now that the different squad members of the soul have been unboxed, it’s crystal clear.

uh, what exactly you on about?

lowkey, i’m spillin’ tea in private—don’t wanna have these tragedian clout-chasers and the rest of the imitation tribe run their mouths—but honestly, all that poetical mimicry straight-up wrecks the brain vibes of the crowd, and knowing its true nature is the only antidote to that weak sauce.

break it down for me—what’s the tea?

alright, lemme drop some knowledge: even though i’ve been shook and mad in love with homer since day one—dude’s such the OG captain and mentor of that charming tragic squad—that doesn’t give him more clout than the truth itself. so, i gotta speak my mind.

lit, he said.

so, hmu and listen up, or better yet, drop your response.

fire your question.

yo, can you break down for me what imitation even is? 'cause i’m straight-up clueless.

lol, you’d think i’d be on that level.

why not? sometimes the basic peeps spot stuff faster than the ultra-hypes, ya feel me?

facts, he said; but with you around, even if i had a half-ass idea, i wouldn’t have the guts to drop it. you wanna check it out yourself?

alright, so let’s kick off our investigation the classic way: whenever a bunch of individuals share a common name, we vibe that they also share a matching mental blueprint or form—catch my drift?

i got you.

peep this: there are tons of beds and tables in the world, right?

yeah.

but lowkey, there’s only two blueprint vibes—one for a bed and one for a table.

facts.

and the dude who whips up a bed or table does it following that idea vibe—that’s just our way of choppin’ it up—but no craftsman is out here creating the actual blueprint itself. how would that even work?

deadass impossible.

and then there’s another creative beast—I’m curious, what do you say about him?

who’s that?

the one who bosses up all the work of every other craftsman—the supreme creator.

yo, that’s one epic dude!

hold up, there’s more: this is the guy who not only makes every type of vessel, but also plants, animals, himself, and, like, literally everything—the earth, the heavens, and all the bits in between; he even snaps up the gods in his lineup.

for real, he’s a straight-up wizard, no cap.

omg, you sound shook—so you tryna say there’s no real creator, or that on one level there might be a creator of all these things but on another, nah? like, could you even whip them all up yourself?

how so?

it’s mad simple; there are tons of ways to pull it off real quick—none faster than just spinning a mirror on loop. soon enough, you’d have the sun, the heavens, the earth, yourself, all the animals and plants, and everything we just dropped in conversation, all in that mirror reflection.

yeah, he said; but they’d just be clout-worthy appearances, not the real deal.

lit, i said—you’re really hitting the main vibe now. and check it: the painter is basically the same—a creator of mere appearances, right?

obviously.

but then i guess you’re gonna say what he makes isn’t the real truth. and yet, isn’t there a way in which the painter can whip up a bed too?

yup, he said, but it’s just a low-res, fake bed.

and what about the actual bed maker? weren’t you saying that he only makes a specific, particular bed—not the essential, true blueprint of the bed itself?

yep, i did.

so if he ain’t crafting what’s genuinely real, then he can’t create true existence—just a weak, lifelike copy; and if anyone tries to say that the craftsman’s work is the real deal, they’re straight-up spreading fake news.

anyway, he replied, philosophers would call that straight-up bogus.

no cap, that’s why his work is just a fuzzy echo of truth.

facts.

so, let’s peep who this imitator actually is, based on our examples?

sure thing.

alright, here’s the tea: we got three beds. one is totally naturally popping off, made by god—‘cause, come on, who else would be the maker?

nah.

there’s another that’s straight-up carpenter-made, right?

def.

and the painter’s work is a third kind?

yep.

so beds come in three flavors, and there are three boss-level creators running the show: god, the bed maker, and the painter.

yeah, three for real.

god, whether it was a vibe or a must-do, only dropped one natural bed—no duplicates, no re-runs—'cause if he dropped two, a third one would magically slide in as the true blueprint that both copies reference, and that would be the ideal bed, not the knock-offs.

so why’s that?

‘cause even if he cranked out two, a third would always pop up as the OG idea that the first two try to mimic—and that OG is the real ideal bed.

facts, he said.

god was totally woke to this, and he wanted to be the ultimate boss—the real maker of a genuine bed, not just some one-off craftsman—so he dropped a bed that, by nature, is one and only.

that’s what we believe.

so, are we gonna call him the natural author, the original creator of the bed?

yeah, he replied; since through his natural creative process, he’s the mastermind behind this and every other thing.

and what about the carpenter—isn’t he also out here making beds?

yup.

but would you call the painter a legit creator and maker?

nah, not at all.

so if he ain’t the maker, what’s his role with the bed?

i think, he said, that we can straight up dub him the imitator—the copycat of what the others produce.

cool, i said; so you’re saying the dude who’s third in line from nature is just a mimic?

certainly, he said.

and the tragic poet is also an imitator—so, like all imitators, he’s three steps removed from the king and the truth?

that seems to be the tea.

alright, so we’re on the same page about imitators. but what about the painter? i wanna know if he’s copying what exists naturally or just mimicking artist-made creations.

nah, he only copies the artist’s hustle.

as they actually are or just as they vibe? you gotta lock that down.

what do you mean?

i mean, you can peep a bed from all angles—side-eye, top-down, however you slice it—and it’ll look different, but deep down, nothing’s changed. same goes for literally everything.

yep, he said, it’s just an optical trick.

so now, here’s another one: is painting meant to mimic things as they truly are or just as they appear—a vibe of appearance versus reality?

appearance, no doubt.

so basically, the imitator, i said, is hella far from the real truth—only grazing a tiny bit of the whole deal, which ends up as just an image. like, a painter might drop a pic of a cobbler, a carpenter, or any other pro without even knowing their craft, and if he’s good, he might straight-up fool kids or noobs from afar into thinking they’re seeing a real carpenter.

facts.

and whenever some dude claims he found a guy who’s basically a know-it-all in every art, with super-accurate deets on everything—i mean, we can only assume this dude’s a total simp who got duped by some wizard or actor he met, thinking they were omniscient, 'cause he couldn’t break down the real deal between knowledge, ignorance, and imitation.

big facts.

so when we hear folks say that tragedians—and homer leading the pack—know every art and all things human, from virtue to vice and even the divine, claiming that a good poet can only drop heat if he truly knows his subject, and that without that knowledge he’ll never be a true poet, we gotta wonder if they’re falling for the same scam. maybe they got catfished by imitators, forgetting that these works are just knock-offs, three layers removed from the truth, made without any real deets because they’re all about appearances, not reality. or maybe they’re right, and poets genuinely get the stuff they rave about?

the question, he said, definitely deserves a deep think.

so, do you figure that if someone could whip up both the original and its image, would he ever settle for just being an image-maker? would he let imitation be his whole life’s vibe, as if he had no higher calling?

i’d say nope.

the true artist—the one who really gets what he’s copying—would be all about the real, authentic vibe instead of mere imitations; he’d wanna leave behind a stack of epic, aesthetic legacies, and instead of being the one dishing out praise, he’d prefer to be the subject of that praise.

yeah, he said, that would score him mad respect and serious clout.

then, i said, we gotta hit up homer with a question—not about medicine or any arts his poems casually mention. we’re not gonna ask him or any poet if he patched up patients like asclepius or started a whole med-school vibe like the asclepiads, or if he just dished out secondhand tea on medicine; but we deserve to know about military tactics, politics, education—the top-tier, noble topics in his verses. so we say, “friend homer, if you’re only one layer away from the truth in what you say about virtue—not a full-on image mimester—and if you can actually peep what hustles level up or down men in both private and public life, then drop this: which state was ever better governed because of your help? lacedaemon’s chill order? that’s all lycurgus’s rep, and mad other cities got their groove from other peeps; so who says you were a boss legislator who did any real good? italy and sicily throw mad props for charondas, and solon gets his own cheers; so what city can brag about you?”—is there any city that can drop your name in that way?

i think not, glaucon said; not even the homerids themselves claim he was a legislator.

but fr, was there any war he actually helped win with his counsel while he was still in the game?

nah, none.

or is there any invention credited to him—something that applies to the arts or everyday life—like those drops from thales the milesian, anacharsis the scythian, or other genius dudes?

absolutely zilch.

so, if homer never did any public service, was he at least a personal guide or mentor? did he have a crew of ride-or-die peeps who vibed with his homeric way of life—like how pythagoras was mad loved for his wisdom and his followers still get mad props for that order?

nothing like that is ever on record about him. for real, socrates, creophylus—homer’s homie, that mere mortal whose name always cracks us up—might even get roasted harder for being clueless, since they say homer was majorly ghosted by him and his crew back in the day.

yeah, i replied, that’s the tradition. but, glaucon, imagine if homer had actually been the real mvp who schooled and leveled up mankind—if he had legit knowledge instead of being just a mimic—wouldn’t he have been flooded with followers and mad love? look, protagoras of abdera, prodicus of ceos, and a whole squad of others only need to whisper to their crew: “you ain’t gonna run your crib or state until you name us as your education ministers”—and that slick hustle got people so hyped, they practically carried these dudes on their shoulders. and is it even possible that homer’s or hesiod’s own day squad would let these legends roam free as rhapsodists if they actually could make mankind virtuous? wouldn’t they clutch them like gold, making them stick around? or if the boss dipped, wouldn’t the disciples trail him everywhere until they maxed out on education?

yes, socrates, that's totally the vibe.

then, aren’t we forced to deduce that all these poetic peeps, starting with homer, are nothing but imitators? they straight-up copy snapshots of virtue and all that jazz, but never hit the real truth. a poet is like that painter we mentioned—dropping a pic of a shoemaker even though he’s clueless about the craft—and his work scores enough with the noob crowd who judge only by looks and colors.

deadass.

similarly, the poet with his words just slaps on the color schemes of all the arts, barely understanding their true nature—only mimicking the vibe—while the equally clueless audience only judges based on his flow, thinking that if he raps about cobbling, military tactics, or anything else in smooth metre, harmony, and rhythm, he’s spitting pure fire. that’s the natural flex of melody and rhythm. and i’m sure you’ve peeped how bland poet tales are when you strip away that musical color and just recite them in plain prose.

yep, he said.

they’re like faces that were never truly stunning—just extra for a hot minute—and now the youthful bloom has totally faded.

exactly.

here’s another point: the imitator, the one droppin’ images, knows nada about the real deal; he only gets surface-level appearances. right?

yes.

so let’s get it straight—no half-baked tea here.

spill it.

about the painter, we say he’ll drop an image of reins and even a bit, right?

yeah.

and the leather and brass crew actually crafts the real ones?

certainly.

but does the painter even know the proper form of the bit and reins? nah—hardly do even the brass-and-leather makers; only the rider who actually uses them knows their true shape.

for real.

so, can’t we say that applies to all stuff?

what you mean?

that there are three arts dealing with everything: one that uses, one that makes, and one that just copies it?

yup.

and the excellence, beauty, or truth of every structure—whether living or not—and of every human move is tied to the purpose nature or the creator originally intended.

true that.

so the end-user must be the real mvp with the most insight, showing the maker what’s lit or whack when the work’s in action; like, a flute player will drop to the flute maker which flute actually slaps, guiding him on how to tweak it, and the maker listens up.

for sure.

the user knows his vibe and speaks authority on the goodness or trash of flutes, while the maker—trusting that feedback—just follows his lead.

true that.

the instrument stays the same, but the maker only gets the proper deets on its quality from the knowledgeable user, while the user holds the real insight.

facts.

but will the copycat ever get any of that? will he know from experience whether his drawing is on point or fresh? or is he only gonna have a lame opinion by tagging along with someone who’s got the real juice?

nah, neither.

so he ain’t gonna score any real opinion or knowledge about his imitations’ quality.

i suppose so.

like, will the imitator ever be a genius about his own work?

nah, he’s actually the opposite.

and still, he’ll keep spamming copies without ever knowing what makes something truly great or trash, and will only vibe with what looks dope to the clueless masses.

exactly.

so far, we’re all on the same wavelength: the imitator has zero real knowledge about what he’s copying. imitation’s just a kind of playful sport, and tragic poets—whether in iambic or heroic flow—are, like, the ultimate copycats.

no cap, very true.

and now, i conjure you: haven’t we shown that imitation is, like, three moves removed from the real truth?

definitely.

and what part of a human’s vibe is even the target for imitation?

explain, bruh.

i mean, like, an object that looks huge up close will seem tiny from far away, right?

true that.

and the same object looks straight when you see it out of water, but all crooked when submerged; and something concave can flip to look convex—thanks to our eyes getting tricked by colors. so, mad confusion shows up inside us, and that’s the weak spot the art of trickery—light, shadow, and other clever hacks—exploits, hitting us like straight-up magic.

facts.

and then the homies of measuring, counting, and weighing swoop in to save our understanding—and there’s a whole beauty in that—so the whole vibe of “more” or “less,” “heavier” or “lighter” stops running the show and bows down to cold, hard calculation.

for real true.

and this gotta be the work of that calculating, rational side of our soul, right?

for sure.

and when that part checks and confirms that some things are equal, or that some are greater or lesser than others, an apparent contradiction pops off?

true.

but didn’t we say a legit contradiction is impossible—the same brain can’t have two totally opposite takes on the same thing at once?

deadass.

so that part of the soul giving off a vibe that clashes with the measure isn’t the same as the part that vibes with the proper measure, right?

true.

and the smartest part of our soul is the one that trusts in measurement and calculation, yeah?

totally.

and whatever vibes against that is just one of the inferior, trash principles of our soul?

no doubt, fam.

that’s exactly the conclusion i was aiming for when i said that painting, drawing, and imitation in general—when doing their own gig—are hella far removed from the truth, hanging out with parts of our soul that are just as off-reason, and they ain’t got any real, healthy purpose.

exactly.

imitative art is like a low-tier bae marrying another low-tier, and they only spawn inferior, trash offspring.

so true.

yo, so is this only a sight flex, or does it also hit your earwaves, reppin’ what we call poetry, no cap?

bet, same deal applies to poetry.

i’m not just tryna drip some random vibes from that painting sim analogy; let's dive deep and peep whether that insta-level poet copycat skill is lit or straight trash, fam.

fr, go ahead.

so here's the tea: imitation copies the moves of peeps, whether they’re doing it on purpose or totally by accident, and they think somethin’ good or bad went down—so they get all hyped or totally salty about it—and that’s pretty much the whole story. anything extra, or nah?

nah, that’s it, end of story.

but yo, in all these wild scenarios, is the dude even vibing with his own self? like, just as his eyeballs get all shook up with mixed feels over the same stuff, doesn’t his life end up like a chaotic group chat full of clashing opinions? ngl, we already all agreed on that; our soul is basically a nonstop stream of, like, a thousand drama drops happening at once, fr.

and he was like, “facts, we got it right.”

i was like, “yeah, so far so good—but we totally missed a crucial deetz that needs that extra glow-up.”

omg, what did we forget?

didn’t we drop that a real one, even when he loses his son or his most prized treasure, handles the hit with way more chill vibes than someone else?

facts.

but yo, does that mean he’s completely numb, or is it like, he still gets sad but keeps it low-key?

he clapped back, “nah, he’ll def catch feels, but he levels them down, no cap.”

so, tell me fam: is he more likely to battle his sadness when everyone’s watching, or when he’s just vibing solo?

tbh, it’s a whole different energy if he’s on display versus chillin’ incognito.

like, when he’s alone, he’s gonna drop so many off-the-cuff moves that he’d be super embarrassed if anyone caught him in the act, fr.

for sure.

there’s like, this inner rulebook in him telling him to hold it down, plus his own raw pain pushing him to dive into his sorrow.

facts.

but real talk, when a dude’s pulled in two opposite vibes over the same tea, that legit means he’s got two clashing inner crews, no cap.

100%.

one crew’s all about sticking to the rulebook, right?

explain, bruh.

basically, the rulebook says chill under the struggle, fam; don’t let impatience win, ‘cause who’s to say if stuff is lit or totally trash? impatience nets you nada—and honestly, no human drama is that major, plus being over-sad just blocks you from snagging what’s most needed at the moment.

he was like, “so, what’s the real must-have right now?”

we gotta chat about what went down, and once the dice are thrown, we gotta reorg our hustle based on what pure reason deems best; not like kids who, after a fall, cling to their boo-boo and waste time throwing a fit, but rather always train their soul to bounce back, uplift what’s fallen, and yeet away that sorrow with some epic healing moves.

he was like, “facts, that’s the ultimate hack for fending off life’s shade.”

i replied, “so does your high-key inner boss ride with this reason vibe?”

obviously, bet.

and then there’s that other emo crew in us that’s all about rehashing our troubles and wallowing, always craving that extra dose of lament—totally irrational, weak sauce, and straight-up cowardenergy.

deadass, no cap.

and check it: that rebellious side serves up endless meme material for copycats, whereas that wise, chill vibe is hella tough to nail—especially on stage when a random crowd in a theatre doesn’t even relate to such calm energy.

facts, obviously.

so the copycat poet, tryna go viral, isn’t built to please the soul’s rational boss; they’re all about that hot-and-cold, extra feels vibe that’s way easier to mimic, no cap.

for sure.

and now, legit, we can toss this guy right next to a lame painter—‘cause he’s like the painter in two key ways: first, his work is a low-budget version of the truth, and second, he’s only vibing with the shallow corner of the soul. thus, it’s totally on point to boot him out of a well-run state—‘cause he’s all about hyping up wild feelings while wrecking real reason. just like a city where the shady peeps run the show and the good ones get sidelined, in a man’s soul this copycat poet sets up a toxic vibe, indulging an irrational side that can’t tell epic from meh—dude’s basically a factory for shallow images, far removed from any real truth.

deadass, exactly.

but yo, we ain’t even dropped our heaviest burn yet: the fact that poetry can straight-up mess with even the top-tier peeps (and, fr, hardly anyone is spared), is mad savage.

yeah, no cap, if that’s the real spill, it’s hella scary.

check this: the dopest among us, when we vibe with a Homer drop or a tragic tearjerker where some pitiful hero is all over his feels—crying, smacking his chest, the whole dramatic deal—we get mad emotional, and we’re like, “yo, big props to that poet for hitin’ our heartstrings!”

yeah, obviously, i get it.

but yo, when we catch our own drama, suddenly we flex the opposite vibe—we wanna be all quiet and hold it down like true OGs; that weepy side that got us hyped in the recitation is now treated as, like, extra wimpy or even a girl thing, no cap.

facts, he agreed.

so can we really be down with someone who’s flaunting what we’d all be lowkey ashamed to do ourselves?

nah, he was like, “that just ain’t it, bro.”

i fired back, “nah fam, from one angle it does seem kinda reasonable.”

what angle though?

i was like, “peep this: when misfortune hits, we naturally crave a good cry to ease the pain—but since we keep our own sadness on lockdown, poets come along and set it free. so our better nature—still not fully schooled by reason—lets that empathetic side break loose when the sorrow ain’t ours. and the audience, thinking there’s zero shame in boosting someone who spills their epic feels, sees it as a win. why be snobby and miss out on both the feels and the dope poem? hardly anyone thinks about how other peeps’ bad vibes might rub off on you and mess up your own mood.”

preach, that's so true!

and, real talk, the same goes for cringy jokes. there are memes you’d be too embarrassed to drop yourself, but when they hit on stage or even in private, you’re like, “lol, that’s hilarious,” without feeling grossed out by how out of line they are. just like with pity—our inner vibe used to be held down by reason ‘cause we didn’t wanna look like clowns, but then you end up channeling that wild humor at home, lowkey turning into your own comic poet.

facts, he agreed.

and honestly, the same goes for all our wild feels—lust, anger, desire, pain, pleasure—every move we make is drenched in these vibes. poetry is out here fueling and watering all that passion, instead of flipping the switch to shut it down. it basically lets the feels run the show, even though, if we wanna level up in happiness and virtue, they really should be reigned in.

i can’t argue with that.

so, glaucon, i said, whenever you run into those homer stan types preaching that homer is the ultimate teacher of hellas and his vibes are crucial for schooling us and running human affairs, let’s give props to those peeps—they’re solid as far as their wisdom goes; and yeah, we’re down with homer being the top poet and OG tragedy dropper. but we gotta be rock-solid on the idea that only god-hymns and shouts out to legends are the only kinda poetry that should be vibing in our state. ‘cause if we let that sweet, honey-coated muse crash in—whether in epic or lyrical form—then it’s not law and human reason running the show, but raw pleasure and pain will end up calling all the shots.

he was like, “preach, that's truth right there.”

and now that we’re back on the poetry track, let this our defense serve as proof that our earlier call to boot out that wild art from our state was totally on point—reason forced our hand, no cap. but so she doesn’t think we’re being all harsh and uncool, let’s drop that there’s been an ancient beef between philosophy and poetry; there are mad signs of it—like that “yelping hound howling at his lord,” or that dude “all might but full of petty buzz,” plus “the squad of sages dodging zeus,” and even “those sneaky thinkers who are just broke, period.” and honestly, there are countless throwbacks proving their old-school beef. still, let’s tell our sweet muse and the sidekick arts of imitation that if she can flex her creds and show she belongs in a well-run state, we’ll welcome her with open arms—we totally vibe with her charms; but we can’t just lie for the sake of it. i gotta say, glaucon, you’re lowkey as charmed by her as i am, especially when she drops up in homer, right?

yeah, i’m hella charmed, no doubt.

so, should we call for her comeback from exile, but only if she drops a lit self-defense in some fresh lyrical beat or something?

for sure.

plus, we can even let her non-poet wingmen—those poetry lovers who aren’t official poets—drop some prose on her behalf, proving not only that she’s all kinds of pleasant but also that she’s a real upgrade for states and human life, and we’ll vibe with that. ‘cause if poetry can be both a flex and a legit tool, we’re all in, right?

he was like, “facts, we’re definitely winning on that front.”

if her self-defense bombs, then listen, my dude: just like those who are totally smitten yet hold themselves back when their crush goes against their own best interests, we gotta, after some bittersweet struggle, let her go. we’re all fueled by that deep love for poetry that noble state vibes taught us, so we wanna see her drop her absolute best; but until she can nail her defense, our counter-argument will be our charm—something we’ll keep on replaying while her verses hit our ears—so we don’t slip into a childish infatuation that wrecks us all. bottom line: we know that the kind of poetry we dissed isn’t really about truth, and anyone who falls too hard for it, putting his inner city at risk, should ride our words as law, no cap.

he was like, “preach, i’m totally with you on that.”

i continued, “my dear glaucon, the stakes here are massive—way higher than they seem—whether a dude turns out good or bad. like, what’s the point if, under the hype of honor, cash, power, or even that poetry drip, he ghosts justice and virtue?”

he replied, “facts, i’m sold on that argument—i bet anyone would be, honestly.”

but yo, we haven’t even dropped the fact that virtue’s waiting for some next-level, epic rewards.

like, are there even bigger flexes? if so, they gotta be off the charts, beyond our wildest dreams.

i said, “dude, what’s ever been huge for a hot minute? three score years and ten is literally peanuts when stacked up against forever, no cap.”

he shot back, “more like nothing.”

and like, if you’re immortal, would you ever sweat that tiny blip instead of the entire eternity?

for sure, it’s the whole deal. but why you askin’, bro?

i reminded him, “aren’t you woke that a man’s soul is totally immortal and unbreakable, no cap?”

he peeped me in shock and was like, “no fr, for real—are you seriously gonna stand by that?”

i was like, “hella yes, i gotta—and so should you. proving it is a total breeze, trust.”

he was like, “i see some major hurdles here, but i’m tryna hear you drop that argument you make sound all chill about.”

alright, listen up.

i’m all ears.

so, there’s that thing you call good and another you call evil, right?

he was like, “yep, that’s the tea.”

you down with the idea that the stuff that corrupts and wrecks is evil, while the energy that saves and uplifts is good?

yeah, for sure.

and you’re cool with the notion that every single thing has both a good and a bad side? like, ophthalmia is the bad side for the eyes and a gnarly disease for the whole body; mildew messes up corn, rot wrecks timber, and rust fries copper and iron—basically, almost everything carries its own built-in decay and bad vibes, right?

facts.

and anything that catches these toxic vibes is doomed to go full evil and eventually fizzles out, yeah?

true, indeed.

basically, the inner vice inherent in each thing is what leads to its own downfall; and if that doesn’t crush it, nothing else will—‘cause good ain’t gonna destroy it, and neither will some neutral blah that isn’t even good or evil.

definitely not.

so if we find something that, despite its built-in corruption, just won’t break down or vanish, then we gotta say that nature’s basically immune to destruction, right?

we can assume that, for sure.

well, i said, “but what about the soul—doesn’t any evil mess it up?”

he replied, “yup, all those bad vibes we just dropped—unrighteousness, overindulgence, basic cowardice, ignorance—are in the mix.”

but do any of those actually dissolve or destroy the soul?—and don’t get us twisted into thinking that a shady, clueless dude, when busted, just crumbles under his own injustice, which is a deep soul-level evil. think about the body: its intrinsic evil is like a disease that totally rots and annihilates it; everything we mentioned eventually self-destructs through its own built-in corruption. ain’t that the real tea?

yep, you got it.

now, apply that same logic to the soul. does the injustice or any other bad vibe inherent in the soul slowly consume it—cling onto it so hard that, eventually, it brings about its own death and splits it from the body?

definitely not, no way.

but then, i said, it’s just cray to think that something can be wiped out by an external bad vibe if it couldn’t also self-destruct from its own inner corruption, right?

he shot back, “yeah, that makes sense.”

i said, “glaucon, peep this: even if your food’s all stale or rotten, if that bad vibe stays locked in the food, it’s not gonna straight-up destroy your body. but if that grossness spreads corruption into you, then your body’s basically wrecked by its own disease. however, to claim that your body (one entity) can be destroyed by food’s bad quality (a completely separate entity) that doesn’t even naturally infect you? nah, we’re absolutely not buying that.”

true that.

and along those lines, unless some physical baddie can trigger a soul-level evil, we can’t say that the soul—being its own whole vibe—gets dissolved by any mere external nastiness from another source, right?

he was like, “facts, i feel that.”

so either we crush this conclusion, or, until it’s busted, we must never claim that fever, any other disease, a knife to the throat, or even slicing your whole body to bits, can destroy the soul—unless it turns out that the soul itself becomes extra unholy or unrighteous because of it. basically, no one should say that something external can kill the soul if it isn’t already wrecking it from the inside.

and he added, “and for real, no one can prove that a man’s soul turns extra shady after death.”

but if some person, refusing to admit that the soul is immortal, goes off and says that the dying actually become even more evil and unrighteous, then—if they’re right—we’d have to roll with the idea that injustice, like a nasty virus, is lethal to the crooked, and those who carry that mess end up getting iced by their own inherent destructive power. though, this would go down in a way totally different from how the wicked currently get clapped by others as payback for their moves.

nah, he shot back, “if injustice kills the crooked, it ain’t that brutal for them—they basically get freed from evil. i actually suspect it’s the opposite: that injustice, if it’s got the power, will end up murdering others and keep the murderer alive—yeah, even wide awake; his crib is nothing like a house of death.”

i agreed, “true; if the soul’s built-in bad vibes can’t kill it, then whatever’s meant to destroy one body can’t wipe out a soul or anything else that isn’t meant to be destroyed, no cap.”

he was like, “yeah, that’s mad unlikely.”

so, since the soul can’t be destroyed by any evil—whether from within or without—it’s gotta exist forever, right? and if it lasts forever, it’s totally immortal.

certainly, for real.

that’s the verdict, i said; and if that’s on point, then the number of souls stays constant—none vanish, so they won’t shrink in count. nor will they suddenly multiply, ‘cause any increase in these immortal vibes would have to come from something mortal, meaning that everything would eventually be set in immortality.

facts, very true.

but yo, we can’t really believe that—reason won’t let us—any more than we can believe the soul, in its pure form, is a mishmash of random, clashing elements.

he asked, “what are you on about, bro?”

i explained, “the soul, since it’s certified immortal, has gotta be the ultimate masterpiece—it can’t be a cheezed-up collage of random parts, right?”

he quipped, “nah, for real.”

her immortality is already proven by what we just laid down, and there’s a truckload of proofs on deck; but to peep the soul as it REALLY is—not like the messy version we see now, wrecked by its hookup with the body and all those miseries—you gotta view it through the lens of pure reason, in its pristine, original drip. then, its true beauty, along with all the deets about justice, injustice, and everything else, will pop off clear as day. so far, we’ve been real about how the soul shows up today, but remember: we’re only seeing it like a sea god that’s been battered—like glaucus, whose original glow is nearly hidden ‘cause his parts got smashed, crusted over with seaweed, shells, and stones, turning him into a total monster compared to his true form. our soul’s looking the same—janky and marred by a bazillion ills. but not there, glaucon, not there is where we gotta fix our gaze.

so, where do we even look for it then?

at her big brain love of wisdom. let’s peep who she’s vibing with and what squad and convos she’s chasing ‘cause of her next-level connection with the immortal, eternal, and divine—no cap. also, imagine how she’d totally glow up if she went full boss mode and followed that superior principle, yeeting herself outta the ocean she’s chillin’ in rn and ghosting all the basic stones, shells, and rocky trash that surround her ‘cause she’s been munching on that basic earth food and getting overgrown by the so-called good things of this life. then, fam, you’d see her for real and know if she’s rocking one flex or a whole emoji set of shapes, and what her true nature is. i think we’ve dropped enough tea about her feels and the forms she takes in this current vibe.

true, he replied.

and thus, i said, we’ve totally aced the rules of this debate; we didn’t even flex those rewards and glories of justice you mentioned from homer and hesiod—but justice, in her own vibe, proved to be the ultimate cheat code for a baller soul. let any dude flex his just moves, whether he’s rocking the ring of gyges or not, and even if he goes extra by putting on hades’ helmet.

for real.

and now, glaucon, no cap, there’s zero harm in me breaking down just how massive the rewards are that justice (and the whole squad of virtues) hooks up the soul with—from gods and mortals, both irl and in the afterlife.

certainly not, he said.

so, yo, will you pay back what you borrowed in our debate?

what did i borrow?

i mean, the idea that a just dude should sometimes look sus while the shady ones look lit—‘cause you were vibing that even if the real tea can’t hide from the all-seeing gods and humans, we still gotta throw in that assumption for the argument’s sake, so that pure justice can be weighed against pure injustice. remember that?

i’d be mad salty if i forgot.

so, since the verdict’s in, i’m officially calling—on justice’s behalf—that the mad props and clout due to her, as recognized by gods and mortals alike, should be handed back to her by us. since she’s proven to give off real vibes and isn’t here to catfish those who truly possess her, let all the credit that was snatched be returned, so she can flex that signature win of appearance that’s totally hers, and which she naturally gives to her own crew.

bet, he said, that demand is straight up just.

first things first, i said—and that’s like the first loot you gotta return—the vibe of both the just and the shady is 100% known to the gods.

granted.

and if both crews are on the gods’ follow list, then obviously one squad is the gods’ ride-or-die while the other’s straight-up beef, just like we lowkey agreed from the jump?

true.

and the gods’ bestie is assumed to score all the prime perks, minus only the necessary bad vibes that come as a follow-up to past misdeeds, right?

certainly.

so this must be our idea of a just dude: even when he’s broke, sick, or facing any rough patch, the universe will eventually squad up to bless him in life and even in death—‘cause the gods only stan anyone hustling to hit that divine, godlike vibe by chasing virtue. bet?

yeah, he replied; if a dude’s flexing god-level vibes, the big guy won’t ghost him.

and for the shady ones, shouldn’t it be the opposite vibe?

certainly.

so these are the epic victory vibes—the palms of victory—that the gods drop on the just, right?

that’s my conviction, no cap.

and what about what they snag from mortals? check it: the sly, shady ones are like runners who smash the sprint from start to finish but then dip, ending up looking like total memes—slinking away with droopy ears and zero crown flex—whereas the real mvp runs all the way, secures the win, and gets crowned like a boss.

no cap, true.

and now, let me rehash the blessings for the just that you were mistakenly tossing to those “fortunate” unjust peeps. i’ll say the same as you did for the others: as they mature, they can totally boss up in their own city if they’re feeling it; they marry whoever they want and hand out unions like free merch; everything you said about the others, i now say about these homies.

on the flip side, the shady crew—even if they dodge heat in their youth—eventually get exposed as total clowns and end up looking mad cringe by the endgame. when they grow old and miserable, both random strangers and insiders roast them; they get rekt and then receive savage disses that are anything but polite, as you pointed out; they’ll be tortured and even have their peepers burned out, just like you dropped.

and yo, you can assume i recapped the rest of your horror scroll, right? can i just trust these deets are legit true?

certainly, he said; what you say is totally on point.

these, then, are the prizes, rewards, and goodies that gods and humans serve up to the just in this lifetime, besides the other lit perks that justice herself delivers.

yeah, he said—and they’re all that and a bag of chips, lasting forever.

but still, i said, these rewards are basically peanuts next to the epic recompenses waiting for both the just and the unjust after death. and yo, you need to listen, ‘cause then both squads get full payment on our debate’s tab.

speak up, he said; there’s so little i’d rather jam to.

well, i said, let me drop a tale—not one of those odysseus sagas for alcinous, but a hero story about er, the son of armenius, a legit pamphylian OG. he got clapped in battle, and ten days later, when the bodies were already rotting, his body was found fresh and totally immune to decay, then yeeted home for a proper burial. and on day twelve, while he was chillin’ on the funeral pyre, boom—he respawned and spilled all the tea about what he peeped in the other realm.

he said that when his soul dipped out of his body, it hit a journey with a major squad, and they rolled up to this mysterious spot with two savage openings in the earth—side by side—and right across, there were two other vibes opening up in the heavens above.

in that in-between zone, judges were posted, dishing out verdicts to the just and slapping on their sentences right then and there, ordering them to ascend on the heavenly right-hand lane; while the unjust got summoned to slide down the lower left-hand path—and these peeps were sporting symbols of their deeds, strapped to their backs like some cringe accessory.

er rolled up, and the judge squad told him he was the messenger— the ultimate reporter—to drop the tea of the afterlife to humankind, and they commanded him to soak in every bit of deets meant to be peeped in that space.

then he peeped that on one side, souls were bouncing out of both the heaven and earth openings once their sentences were dropped; and on the other two, he spotted other souls—some coming up from the earth all dusty and worn from the grind, while others descended from the heavens, sparkling and super clean.

regularly, these souls rolled in from long, epic journeys and hit up a chill meadow like it was a lit festival—setting up camp and vibing. those who were old pals embraced and swapped stories, with the earth crew straight-up nosy about the heavenly vibes and the heaven squad curious about what’s going down below.

they traded the tea on their journeys—those from below weeping and spilling feels over all the dark stuff they endured on a thousand-year underworld trek, while those from above flexed stories of divine delights and visuals so unreal, they were straight-up next-level.

but, glaucon, this tale is epic AF, so tl;dr: for every savage wrong dished out, a soul got hit with a tenfold smackdown—like every 100 years (a human lifetime style) gets multiplied by ten in a thousand years.

like, if you cause a massacre, flip on your squad, enslave cities or armies, or commit any other savage moves, every offense gets a tenfold punishment, and the rewards for beneficence, justice, and holiness are stacked in the same ratio—no cap.

i won’t even rehash the tea about toddlers dying almost on spawn. regarding piety versus impiety to gods and parents, and for murderers, there were even more brutal paybacks he laid out—next-level horror, fr.

he dropped that he was there when one spirit hit up another, asking, "yo, where’s ardiaeus the great?" (and btw, ardiaeus lived a thousand years before er—this dude was a tyrant in some pamphylian city, offed his old man and elder bro, and dropped a load of other hella cringy crimes).

the other spirit clapped back, "he ain’t coming here and never will. and yo, this was one of the most savage scenes we witnessed. we were posted at the cavern’s mouth, about to ascend after wrapping up our experiences, when suddenly ardiaeus and a crew—mostly tyrants plus some notorious criminal NFTs—popped up. they were all set to bounce to the upper world, but the cavern entrance, instead of letting them slide, dropped a mega roar every time one of these incurable sinners or someone who hadn’t been schooled enough in justice tried to level up. then, these wild, fiery dudes standing by caught the roar, grabbed them head to toe, dropped them, flayed them with whips, and dragged them along the road like wool being carded on thorns—while announcing to everyone their epic crimes and that they were being hauled straight down to hell."

and of all the terrors they suffered, he noted that nothing hit as hard as the sheer panic each one felt in that moment, just scared of catching that dreaded voice; but once everything went silent, one by one, they ascended with crazy joy.

these, er said, were the brutal penalties and retributions—and trust, the blessings were equally massive.

after the spirit squad kicked it in the meadow for seven whole days, on day eight they were forced to bounce on their journey; and on day four after that, er said they rolled up to a spot where, from above, they peeped a straight-up column of light running through all of heaven and earth, in a color vibe that screamed rainbow—but way brighter and purer.

a day later, they reached a place where, smack dab in the middle of that glow, they spotted the ends of chains dangling down from heaven; ‘cause this light is basically heaven’s belt that holds the entire universe together like the undergirders of an epic trireme.

from these endpoints extends the spindle of necessity—the central axle where all cosmic revolutions turn. its shaft and hook are forged in steel, and the whorl is a mix of steel and other fly materials.

the whorl itself is shaped like the ones we peep on earth; the lowdown being there’s one big, hollow, scooped-out whorl, and nested inside are another, then another, and four more—making eight in total, kind of like nested vessels that slide perfectly into one another. the top edges of these whorls pop, and their bottom edges all merge into one continuous circle. right through the center of the eighth whorl, the spindle is jammed home.

here’s the lowkey math: the outermost whorl’s got the fattest rim, and the seven inner rings are scaled down as follows—the sixth is almost as big as the first, with the fourth snug next to it; then the eighth shows up; the seventh comes in as a fifth, the fifth as a sixth, the third slots in as seventh, and finally the second wraps it up as the eighth. cosmic geometry on fleek.

the largest—aka the fixed stars—is blinged out and spangled, and the seventh, which is the sun, is the brightest flex. the eighth, or the moon, gets its color from bouncing off the sun’s glow; the second and fifth—saturn and mercury—vibe together with a yellow drip that’s even more lit than the previous, while the third, venus, shines with the whitest glow; the fourth, mars, rocks a reddish tone; and the sixth, jupiter, is a close second in brightness with that white glow.

the entire spindle spins together, but while the whole rig rotates in one direction, the seven inner circles are lowkey moonwalking in the opposite lane. among these, the eighth is the speediest; next up, the seventh, sixth, and fifth groove in sync; then the fourth clutches third place in this reversed hustle; the third shows up as fourth, and the second slides in as fifth. total cosmic tik-tok vibes.

the spindle pivots on necessity’s knees, and on each circle’s top, a siren spins along, dropping that one sick note on loop like a one-track anthem.

all eight circles vibe together into one dope harmony; and equally spaced around, there’s a trio sitting on their thrones—the fates, daughters of necessity, rocking white robes and killer chaplets: lachesis, clotho, and atropos. they harmonize with the sirens’ loop, with lachesis belting out the past, clotho representing the present, and atropos forecasting the future; sometimes clotho gives a right-hand nudge to the outer circle’s spin while atropos guides the inner ones with her left, and lachesis swaps between them. total cosmic dj set, fr.

when er and the spirit crew arrived, their duty was to hit up lachesis immediately; but first, a prophet rolled in, lined everyone up, grabbed lots and life samples from lachesis’s knees, then hopped on a high pulpit and clapped: “hear the word of lachesis, daughter of necessity. mortal souls, check it: a brand-new cycle of life and death is dropping. your genius won’t be handed to you on a silver platter—you get to choose your own vibe. whoever draws the first lot scores first pick, and the life they choose becomes their destiny. virtue is totally free, and as you honor or diss it, you’ll get more or less of it; the choice is on you—and god is totally justified.”

once the interpreter dropped that wisdom, he scrambled the lots all around without any favoritism, and every soul snagged the lot that landed nearest—everyone except er (nothin’ for you, bro)—and as each peep grabbed their lot, they noticed the number they’d landed on.

then the interpreter laid out on the ground a whole spread of life samples. omg, there were way more lives than souls in the room, covering every vibe imaginable. there were lives for every creature and every type of human condition. you had tyrants whose reign lasted their whole life and others who flopped mid-course, ending in poverty, exile, and zero clout; there were lives of famous dudes—some known for their swag, beauty, strength, game wins, or lit family lineage, and others who were famous for being exactly the opposite. and women? same deal. no one fixed character, ‘cause each soul picks up a remix when starting a new life. every possible quality was there, all mixed up with wealth and poverty, health and disease, plus those basic average states.

and look, my dear glaucon, this is the supreme peril of our human state; so we gotta be hella careful. let each one of us ditch all that extra noise and focus on learning one thing only—if we can find someone who helps us level up our ability to tell good from evil—so that we can always, no cap, choose the better life whenever a shot comes our way.

he’s gotta analyze how all these factors impact virtue; figure out how beauty flexes when it’s meshed with poverty or wealth in a soul, and weigh the good and bad spills from being born noble versus humble, or from living a private life versus being in the public eye, from strength versus weakness, smarts versus dullness, and all the natural and earned gifts of the soul when they vibe together; then, by scoping out the nature of the soul with all these qualities, he can decide what’s lit and what’s trash—naming the life that darkens his soul “evil” and the one that brightens it “good,” while benching all the rest.

coz we’ve peeped and know that this is the dopest choice for both life and the afterparty after death.

so a dude must roll into the next world with an unbreakable, adamantine faith in truth and decency, so he isn’t dazzled by greedy vibes or any other shady lures of evil; otherwise, when stumbling into tyrannies and similar BS, he might end up dishing out irreversible wrongs on others (and get hit even harder himself). instead, he should learn to ride the middle lane and dodge all extreme cray vibes—not just in this life, but in every life that’s to come. that, my friend, is the true way to happiness.

and according to the deets from the messenger from the other world, this was what the prophet dropped at the time: ‘even for the last comer, if he picks wisely and grinds hard, a hella lit and chill life is on deck. so, the one who grabs first better not act like a scrub, and the last one, don’t hit that despair mode.’

and after the prophet finished his hot take, the first in line slid up and, in a sec, snatched the absolute wildest tyranny; his mind was totally clouded by dumb vibes and over-the-top sensuality, so he never really scoped out the sitch before his pick—and he straight-up missed that fate had him, among other epic fails, destined to chow down on his own kiddos.

but once he got some chill time to reflect and peep his lot, he started smacking his chest and throwing mad regret over his choice, completely ghosting on the prophet’s forecast; instead of owning up to his epic flop, he went off on chance, the gods, and literally everyone else instead of himself.

now this dude was one of those who hailed from heaven, having once vibed in a super well-ordered state in his past life, but his virtue was nothing more than autopilot routine, and he had zero philosophy.

and the same went for other peeps who got similarly wrecked—most of them were sky born and never got schooled by the real-life grind, while the earth squad, who had suffered and peeped others’ pain, took their sweet time before choosing.

and thanks to their rookie status plus the fact that the lot was totally random, many souls ended up swapping a fire destiny for a straight-up dumpster fire, or vice versa.

because if a dude had been all about sound philosophy from the moment he dropped into this world, and if his lot numbers were on fleek, then—as the messenger posted—he’d be chill and happy in the now, and his journey to the next life (and back) wouldn’t be all rough and underground but smooth and heavenly instead.

the most sus part, he said, was the spectacle—sad, laughable, and straight-up bizarre; since most soul picks were based on receipts from their past lives.

there he peeped the soul that used to be orpheus, choosing the life of a swan purely outta beef with the race of women—hating being born a woman since they were his ultimate haters; he also scoped thamyras’s soul, which flipped into the nightingale life; meanwhile, birds like the swan and other musical legends were lowkey tryna level up and be human.

the soul that landed the twentieth lot opted for lion life, and that was ajax, son of telamon, who straight-up refused to vibe as a man, still repping the sting from that shady arms verdict injustice.

next up was agamemnon, who grabbed eagle life—’cause, just like ajax, he was hella done with human nature thanks to all his deep suffering.

midway through, atalanta’s lot came up; peeping the sick flex of an athlete’s fame, she couldn’t resist the temptation and locked in that life. right after her, epeus, son of panopeus, flipped into the vibe of a savvy woman in the arts; and way down at the tail end, the jester thersites went full monkey mode.

odysseus’s soul also rolled in, still waiting to pick, and his lot ended up being the very last in the lineup. having caught all the feels from past toils, he got totally disenchanted with grand ambitions and spent ages scouring for that chill, no-drama private life vibe; he struggled to find it since it was ghosted by everyone else, but once he peeped it, he was like, “bet, i’d be down for that same choice even if mine came first,” and he was super stoked to lock it in.

and not just did humans morph into animals, but also—gotta spill the tea—tame and wild critters were swapping forms with each other and flipping into their matching human vibes; the good turning into the gentle and the evil going full savage, in literally every remix combo.

all the souls had locked in their life choices, and bouncing in that same order, they rolled over to Lachesis, who dispatched the genius each had picked to be the guardian of their new vibe and the plug for their destiny: this genius led the squad first to Clotho, who spun them up in her dope spindle rotation, locking in each fate; then, once they were strapped in, carried them over to Atropos, who spun the threads and made ‘em irreversible—no do-overs—so that without a pause they slid under the throne of Necessity; and when they’d all passed through, they trekked in a fire-hot march to the plain of forgetfulness, a barren zone with zero trees or lush vibes; later, as night fell, they set up camp by the river of unmindfulness, whose water no cup can ever hold; each one was forced to sip a fixed amount—and those not blessed with wisdom ended up chugging extra—and with every swig, they straight-up yeeted all their memories.

after they crashed, right in the dead middle of the night a wild thunderstorm and epic earthquake dropped hard, and in a flash they were yeeted upward in a million ways, like dope shooting stars. but fam, one dude got totally blocked from sipping the water. and how or why he got zipped back to his body, he couldn’t even spill; all he knew was that when he woke up in the morning, he found himself chillin’ on the pyre.

and so, Glaucon, the saga’s been saved from total deletion and will rescue us if we vibe with the prophet’s word; we’ll cruise safely over the river of forgetfulness with our souls staying untainted. that’s why my pro-tip is to always ride the heavenly wave and chase justice and virtue on the daily, ’cause the soul’s immortal and built to flex through every kind of epic good and wild evil. this way, we’ll keep it squad-goals with each other and with the gods—whether we’re kickin’ it here now or, like all-star gamers circling to grab loot, when we finally bag our reward. it’s gonna be all good in this life and on that epic thousand-year pilgrimage we’ve been chatting about.
