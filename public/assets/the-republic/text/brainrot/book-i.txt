book i.

yo, so yesterday i dipped to the piraeus with glaucon, son of ariston, to throw up some prayers to the goddess (bendis, aka the thracian artemis, for real) and also to peep how they’d level up the new festival vibes. i was hype about the lit procession of the locals—even though the thracian squad’s parade was even more extra. once we wrapped up our sacred vibes and soaked in the visual drip, we turned toward the city; and then, outta nowhere, polemarchus—the son of cephalus—peeped us from afar as we were about to bounce home, and hollered to his sidekick to sprint over and say, “hang on, yo, polemarchus wants you to chill a bit.”

i spun around and asked, “where’s your boss at?”

the kid was like, “there he is, trailing behind—just chill and wait up.”

glaucon was like, “bet, we gotchu,” and a few mins later, polemarchus showed up with adeimantus (glaucon’s bro), niceratus (son of nicias), and a bunch of peeps from the procession.

polemarchus shot one at me: “socrates, i peep that you and your crew are already cruisin’ towards the city.”

i was like, “facts, you ain’t too off, my dude.”

but he clapped back, “yo, can you peep how many squad members there are?”

i was like, “ofc.”

then he asked, “are you strong enough to handle all these peeps? cuz if not, you’d have to stay put.”

i fired back, “can’t we just slide by and convince you to let us scoot?”

he snapped, “like, can you even hype us up if we ain’t vibing with your talk?”

glaucon piped in, “facts, definitely not.”

so, we’re not gonna listen to this, trust that.

adeimantus then added, “yo, haven’t you heard about the torch race on horseback in honor of the goddess that’s dropping tonight?”

i was like, “with horses?! fr, that’s wild. so these riders toss torches around mid-race?”

polemarchus confirmed, “yup, and not only that—but there’s a nighttime festival coming up that you gotta peep. after we grub, let’s bounce and soak in the festival vibes; there’ll be a crew of young blood for a dope chat. so, stick around and don’t be extra stubborn, aight?”

glaucon was like, “guess since you’re insistin’, we gotta roll with it.”

i hit back, “cool, cool, bet.”

so, we dipped with polemarchus to his crib, and there we bumped into his bros lysias and euthydemus, plus thrasymachus from chalcedon, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon (son of aristonymus). also, cephalus—polemarchus’ old man—was there, and damn, i hadn’t seen him in ages; he looked mad ancient. he was chilling on a cushy chair, rocking a garland on his head ‘cause he’d just been sacrificing in the court; a few other chairs were set up in a chill semicircle, and we scooted down next to him. he greeted me with mad hype, then dropped this:

“yo, socrates, you don’t hit up my pad as often as you should. if i could still roll up to see you on my own, i wouldn’t bug you to come here. but now, at my age, i can barely roll to the city, so you better slide into the piraeus more often. real talk: as my body’s pleasures fade, the charm and vibe of a good convo only get sweeter. so don’t ghost my invite—make my crib your go-to chill spot and kick it with these young homies; we’re old friends, and you’ll feel totally at home.”

i shot back, “cephalus, nothing beats kicking it with seasoned peeps—I see y’all as travelers on a journey i might someday be on, so i gotta ask: was the road smooth or mad rocky? basically, i wanna know if life’s a breezy cruise or an epic struggle.”

“alright, socrates,” he said, “lemme drop my two cents. peeps my age squad up together—birds of a feather, y’know—and when we vibe, the usual saga is: i can’t chow down, can’t sip right; all the lit perks of youth and romance are ghosted. back in the day, times were dope, but now it’s like, over. life just ain’t life anymore. some folks be whining about fam disses, blaming old age for all their probs. but for me, socrates, these whiners be blaming the wrong vibe. if old age was the real tea, then i and every old-timer would be on that same struggle. but that ain’t how i roll, nor have my homies. i still remember sophocles—the legendary old poet—when someone asked him, ‘yo, how does love vibe with age? still the same you?’ and he answered, ‘peace’—like, i’m stoked to have dodged that wild ride; i felt like i escaped from a raging, mad boss. his words still hit hard, as fresh now as back then. for real, old age brings major chill and freedom; when all that extra drama fades, as sophocles said, we’re freed from not just one crazy boss, but a whole squad. the truth, socrates, is that these moans and fam beef aren’t really caused by old age—they come from our own characters and temperaments. a peep with a calm, happy vibe barely feels the weight of age, but if you’re on the opposite trip, both youth and old age hit like a heavy burden.”

i sat there, super impressed and prodding him for more—so i said, “cephalus, i kinda suspect most peeps aren’t buying your vibe when you drop that wisdom; they figure your chill old age isn’t ‘cause you’re mellow, but ‘cause you got mad coin—and we all know cash is a killer comforter.”

“true dat,” cephalus replied, “they aren’t convinced—and there’s some truth in their clapbacks, just not as drastic as they think. i could drop one like themmistocles did to that seriphian hater who said i was only famous ‘cause i was an athenian: ‘if you were from my hood or i from yours, neither of us would be famous.’ same goes for those poor souls who gripe about old age; for a good poor dude, old age isn’t a lightweight, and a shady rich guy can never find real peace.”

so, i asked, “cephalus, can i ask: was your bag mostly inherited or did you hustle it out yourself?”

“acquired, for sure, socrates! ya dig? wanna know how much i raked in? in the money game, i’m right in the middle between my dad and granddad. my granddad—i even rock his name—doubled and trebled his stash (what he inherited is basically what i got now), but my dad, lysanias, kinda whittled it down to less than it is today. i’d be stoked if i can leave my sons not just what i got, but even a little extra over what i inherited.”

yo, that's exactly why i hit you with that question, i replied, cuz i peep that you're totally chill about cash – which, fr fr, is more typical of peeps who inherited their stacks rather than hustled for them; the money-makers are lowkey in a second-level crush with coin, like they stan their own bangers or how parents hype up their kids, on top of that natural love for cash for the flex and profit that all humans get. so, no cap, they're pretty much a one-track squad, only yapping about mad props for wealth.

facts, he said.

bet, that's so true, but can i hit you with another q? what's the absolute best blessing you copped from your coin stash?

one, he said, that i probably wouldn't have an easy time convincing others about. cuz listen up, socrates, when a dude thinks his time is almost up, all sorts of cray fears and dramas start poppin' off in his brain – stuff he never ever felt before; those ghost stories about a chill world below and the payback for our here-and-now moves used to be nothing but a lame meme, but now he’s straight up shook, wondering if they’re for real. whether it’s the whole aging vibe or just 'cause he’s cruisin’ closer to that next realm, he starts peepin' these things way clearer; suspicions and intense alarms flood his mind, and he starts reppin' over every bad move he dissed on others. and when he sees that his total screw-ups are mad high, he’ll, like a little kid, jump outta bed in the middle of sleep from fear, all drenched in dark, heavy vibes. but for a dude who feels zero guilt, sweet hope – as our boi pindar drops so charmingly – is like the ultimate hype nurse for his life's playlist:

  "hope cherishes the soul of a homie who lives straight up in justice and holiness, and is, like, the ride-or-die for his years and the squad on his journey; hope is the real mvp flex that can sway even the most restless soul of man."

omg, his words are straight-up fire! and check it, the dopest blessing of having mad stacks – and i'm not dissing any normie, but a legit good guy – is that he never had to go beast mode on anyone by schemin' or scamming them, whether on purpose or by accident; and when he taps out to the big beyond, he ain't stressin' about dropping offerings to the gods or owing any debt to the squad. like, that peace-of-mind vibe is majorly boosted by having cash, so, when you line up all the perks wealth can drop, for a wise homie, this is, in my honest opinion, the top flex.

facts, cephalus, i replied; but when we talk about justice, what’s the real tea? is it just keeping it 100 and paying up your debts—that’s it? and even that, aren’t there some twisty exceptions? like, say a homeboy, when he was solid, stashed his arms with me, and later, when he’s totally off his game, asks for them back—should i just straight up return them? nobody’s gonna hype that as the right move, any more than they'd say i should always be spewing truth to someone who’s way off their vibes.

facts, you're mad right, he replied.

but yo, i said, spitting truth and paying your debts ain't the full 411 on what justice really is.

true that, socrates, if simonides is what we’re vibin' with, chimed in polemarchus.

yo, i gotta bounce, said cephalus, 'cuz i gotta keep an eye on the sacrificial ritual vibes, so i'm droppin' the debate mic to polemarchus and the rest of the crew.

ain't polemarchus like your main successor? i asked.

aye, for sure, he answered, and dipped off laughing as he rolled toward the sacrifices.

spill the tea then, oh heir to this debate—what did simonides drop, and what do you honestly think he meant about justice?

he dropped that paying back your debts is just, and honestly, that vibe seems solid to me.

i’d be mad sorry to doubt the word of such a legendary, lit dude, but his drip, though probably crystal for you, is total static for me. cuz he definitely wasn’t saying that i should just hand back a stashed set of arms – or any other deposit – when someone’s off their game; yet a deposit is still, facts, a debt.

facts.

so when the homie who asks me is totally outta it, i'm not supposed to yeet the stash back, right?

definitely not.

so, when simonides said that payin' your debts was justice, he wasn’t including that off-the-rails case, right?

definitely not; cuz he’s all about that friend vibe – a real homeboy always does good for another homeboy and never goes out to roast them.

so, you're sayin' that if a friend gets back a deposit of gold that ends up hurting them, it ain't really payin' back the debt—that’s the vibe you'd expect him to drop?

yep.

and enemies, too, gotta get what we owe them?

for sure, he said, they should get what’s due; and like, an enemy, in my eyes, owes an enemy whatever is proper to them—in other words, bad juju.

so, simonides, channeling those poetic dark vibes, was basically saying that justice means giving each homie what’s rightful for them, and he called that a debt.

bet that's what he meant, he said.

no cap, i replied; and if we asked him what proper drop is given by medicine, and to whom, what do you reckon he'd say?

for sure, he’d say that medicine drops drugs, grub, and bevvies to human bodies.

and what proper drop does cookery deliver, and to who?

seasoning, bro – that’s the flavor for food.

so then, what does justice drop, and on who?

if, socrates, we vibe with the earlier analogies, then justice is that art that doles out good vibes to friends and low-key bad ones to enemies.

so, that’s his flex then?

i think so, fr.

and who’s best at boosting his squad’s vibes and dissing his haters even when they're down or sick?

the physician, obviously.

or, like, when they’re out cruising the wild seas, dodging all kinds of peril?

the pilot, no doubt.

but in which clutch moves, or aiming for what end, is the just dude most lit at dropping good on his friends and clapping back on his enemies?

by goin’ to war against one side and squad'ing up with the other.

but if a dude is all good and on point, my dear polemarchus, why would he need a physician?

nah.

and if you're not on a wild sea cruise, why call in a pilot?

nah.

so in chill, peace-out times, justice is basically just meh, right?

i’m way off that idea.

so you reckon justice can flex in both peace and battle?

facts.

like farming for that golden corn?

yep.

or like cobbling up fresh kicks for your drip—that what you're sayin'?

yep.

so, what similar clutch flex does justice have in peace mode?

in sealin’ the deal with contracts, socrates – justice is hella useful.

and by contracts, you mean those tight partnerships?

exactly.

but, between a righteous homie and a mad skilled draughts player, who would be the better squadmate in a game?

the skilled player, no cap.

and when it comes to stackin' bricks and stones, is the just dude a better partner than the builder?

nah, it's totally the other way around.

so in what kind of squad-up does the just dude outshine even a baller harpist—since when jammin' on a harp, the legit harp-player totally surpasses a guy who’s just about justice?

in a money collab, obviously.

yeah, polemarchus, but surely not in actual money moves; cuz you wouldn't want a justice nerd advising on buying or selling a horse—a dude who actually knows horses would come in clutch, right?

certainly.

and if you're tryna grab a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be the go-to?

true.

so, what’s that joint play with silver or gold where the just dude is actually the preferred partner?

when you need a deposit to be locked down safe.

you mean when money’s just chillin’, not actively in play?

precisely.

in other words, justice is clutch when your cash is just sitting useless.

that's the vibe.

and if you wanna keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice’s role is lit for both the individual and the state; but when it comes to actually usin' it, you gotta roll with the vine-dresser’s art, ya dig?

straight up.

and when you wanna stash a shield or a lyre rather than use 'em, then justice is the move; but if you're tryna flex 'em in action, then it's all about the soldier or the musician’s craft.

certainly.

so basically, for all these other things too—justice is useful when stuff is on chill mode, and kinda useless when that stuff is in full flex.

that's the takeaway.

so, justice ain't exactly a boss in practicality. but check this: isn't the dude who lands the sickest punch in a brawl or any fight the one best at blocking one back?

certainly.

and is the homie who's mad skilled at dodgin' or bouncing off a sickness also, like, the MVP when it comes to sparking one up?

for real.

and the ultimate camp guard is the one who can, like, stealthily outmaneuver the enemy?

certainly.

so basically, if you're dope at keepin' your stuff secure, you're also slick enough to jack it, right?

yup, that's the takeaway.

so, lowkey, if the just dude's lit at hoardin' cash, he's also, by that logic, mad skilled at snatching it.

that's exactly the inference.

so, turns out, the so-called just dude is, in the end, pretty much a thief. and this is a lesson i bet you picked up from homer; cuz he, when talkin' about autolycus – odysseus's maternal granddude and a total fav of his – drops that line:

  "he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury."

so, you, homer, and simonides are all vibin' that justice is just an artful hustle of thievery; meant, like, to be practiced "for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies"—is that what you were droppin'?

nah, certainly not that, even tho i can't exactly recall what i said before; but i'm still stickin' with that latter vibe.

but yo, here's another q: by "friends" and "enemies," are we talkin' about peeps who are, like, genuinely solid or just frontin' that vibe?

for sure, he said, you’d expect a dude to stan those he sees as good, and to roast those he pegs as trash.

true, but humans are lowkey confused about what's good and what's evil: a bunch of folks who ain't truly good might seem that way, and vice versa.

facts.

so then, might our squad accidentally end up callin' the good haters and the evil ride-or-die peeps?

true.

and then they'd be, like, droppin' good vibes on the baddies and dishing out bad juju to the good? obviously.

but the real ones, the good peeps, are straight-up just and wouldn't go out causin' harm.

true.

so, by your logic, is it justice to clap back on peeps who haven't done any wrong?

nah, socrates; that line of thought is straight-up immoral.

so, i guess we should be, like, boostin' the righteous and dissing the wicked, right?

i vibe with that, for real.

but peep the burn: plenty of dudes who don’t really get human nature end up with friends who are actually toxic – meaning they'd deserve a roast; and they might have enemies who are secretly gems, so they deserve props; but if that's the case, we'd be spittin' something totally opposite to the vibe simonides set.

big facts, he said: and i reckon we gotta fix this mix-up in how we're usin' "friend" and "enemy."

so, what's the glitch, polemarchus? i asked.

we kinda assumed that a friend is someone who appears or is thought to be good.

so, how do we remix this error?

we should say that a true friend is someone who is actually good as well as looks good; and if someone is only puttin' on a good face but ain't really good, then they ain't a friend at all; and the same goes for enemies.

so you're sayin' that the good are our ride-or-die crew and the bad are our haters?

yeah.

and instead of just sayin' that it's justice to do good for our friends and harm our enemies, we should drop it as: it's just to do good for our friends when they're actually good and to dis our enemies when they're truly evil.

yeah, that vibe sounds hella legit to me.

but should the righteous ever drop harmful blows on anyone at all?

no doubt, they should hit up only those who are both shady and their confirmed haters.

when a horse gets clapped, does it glow up or get wrecked?

definitely, it gets wrecked.

like, the horse loses its on-point qualities, not like a dog, right?

yep, of horses.

and dogs, too, lose their inherent doggo vibes when hurt, not horse vibes?

of course.

and won't humans who get injured lose that core human drip—the virtue that makes them who they are?

certainly.

and that core human drip is justice, right?

for sure.

then, if dudes get hurt, they're, like, inevitably made less just?

that's the take.

but can a musician, just by droppin' beats, make folks lose their musical vibe?

def not.

or can a rider, just by flexin' his craft, turn someone into a bad horseman?

impossible.

and can a righteous dude, by simply being righteous, flip someone into injustice—or more generally, can pure good vibes turn a person bad?

absolutely not.

any more than heat can just spawn cold, right?

it totally cannot.

or like, trigger moisture during a drought?

clearly not.

nor can the good ever truly harm anyone.

impossible.

and the just is basically the good, right?

for sure.

so droppin' harm on a friend or anyone else isn’t the move of a just dude—it’s what the unjust do.

i feel that up to the highest degree, socrates.

so if a dude claims that justice is merely payback on debts, and that good is the debt a just dude owes his friends while evil is what he owes his haters—droppin' that ain't smart; cuz, as we've shown, harming someone is never just, no matter how u spin it.

i agree with you, said polemarchus.

so, you and i are ready to throw down on anyone who tries to flex that line from simonides, bias, pittacus, or any of those so-called wise OGs or prophets?

i'm hella ready to squad up and battle on your side, he said.

should i spill whose vibe i think actually started that line?

who, tho?

i reckon that either periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban, or some other mega-rich, flexin' dude with crazy self-love, was the first to drop that justice line: "doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies."

preach, he said.

yep, i said; but if this justice definition also gets wrecked, what alternative roll-up can we serve?

in the heat of the debate, thrasymachus tried several times to hijack the convo for his own drip, but the squad shut him down, dying to hear the finale. but once polemarchus and i were done spitting and things went quiet, he totally lost his chill; gathering all his wild beast energy, he charged at us like a savage tryna snatch us up. we were, like, totally shook, panic-mode activated.

he bellowed to the whole crew: "what crazy biz, socrates, has gotten into you all? and why, you damn goofy peeps, are you brawling among yourselves? i mean, if you truly wanna know what justice is, you shouldn’t just ask—you gotta drop your own answer too, and stop chasing clout by solely tearing off an opponent's argument; there are mad peeps who can ask without being able to answer. and i ain't down for you saying justice is just duty, profit, gain, or interest, cuz that weak sauce won't fly with me—I need clarity and real talk."

i was legit terrified by his rant, shaking so hard i could barely peep him without trembling. honestly, i swear if i hadn’t fixed my eyes on him, i would've been totally struck dumb; but once i saw his fury rising, i braced up and managed to hit him back.

thrasymachus, i stuttered, please don’t roast us too hard. polemarchus and i might've slipped up a bit in our debate, but trust that it wasn’t on purpose. like, if we were out there hunting for gold, you wouldn’t think we were trippin’ over one another and blowing our chance to snag it. so why, when chasing justice – which is way more precious than piles of gold – do you say we're weakly yielding to each other instead of going all out for the truth? no, my dude, we’re hella willing and hyped to get it, but sometimes the vibe just escapes us. so, if that’s the case, you wise peeps should cut us some slack instead of getting mad.

classic socrates, he shot back with a bitter chuckle; "yo, that's just your ironic flex! did i not call it out—did i not warn you that whoever is asked something will always dodge the real answer by using irony or some other shuffle to avoid actually answering?"

you're a philosopher, thrasymachus, i replied, and you know if you ask someone what combo of numbers makes twelve—and you strictly ban them from answering "two times six," "three times four," "six times two," or "four times three," because you say, 'this kind of nonsense won’t cut it for me'—then obviously, if that's your way of setting the question, no one can nail an answer. but imagine if they shot back, "thrasymachus, what do you mean? if one of these banned answers is actually the correct flex, am i screwed for dropping another number that's off?—is that what you're sayin'?"—what would your comeback be?

like, as if these two scenarios were even in the same league! he replied.

why not? i asked; and even if they're not truly identical, but just seem that way to the one gettin' asked, shouldn't he just spit his own thoughts regardless of whether you and i try to shut him down?

so, i guess you're gonna drop one of those banned answers?

i dare say i might – even if it's risky – if, after some deep thought, one of them vibes with me.

but what if i hit you with a justice answer that's next-level and better than any of those? he said, then what do you reckon you deserve to have done to you?

done to me! – like, as any clueless dude should learn from a wise one—that's the vibe i reckon i deserve.

what, and like, no cash out? that's an epic notion!

i'll pay when my wallet's flush, i replied.

but dude, you, socrates, as glaucon already said—and you, thrasymachus, shouldn't sweat cash either, cuz we're all gonna chip in for socrates.

yep, he replied, and then socrates will do his usual move—refusing to drop a straight answer himself, but going all out to tear apart someone else's answer.

bro, i said, how can anyone who claims to know stuff, and even if they've got some hazy ideas, be shut down by a so-called authority from spittin' them? naturally, the speaker should be someone like you who not only claims to know but can actually spill the tea. so, please, enlighten the squad and me, fam.

glaucon and the rest of the crew jumped in on my ask, and thrasymachus, as anyone could see, was lowkey hyped to speak – he thought his answer was fire and would let him shine. but at first, he played it off insisting i should answer; eventually, he relented and started. "check it," he said, "the genius of socrates: he doesn't school himself, but goes around learning from others—without even dropping a 'thank you.'"

i replied, "yeah, it's true i learn from others; but saying i'm ungrateful? that's straight-up bogus. i got zero cash, so i pay in praise, which is honestly all i've got; and trust, i'm always ready to hype anyone who spits real fire—you'll see when you answer, cuz i expect you to slam a killer response."

listen up, then, he declared; "i proclaim that justice is nothing but the interest of the stronger. so now, why don't you give me props? but of course, you won't."

"let me break it down," i replied. "justice, as you say, is the interest of the stronger. so, thrasymachus, what exactly do you mean by that? you ain't tryin' to say that, just because polydamas—the ultimate pancratiast—is stronger than us and finds beef perfect for boosting his strength, that eating beef is automatically good for us weaklings and, like, totally just for us, right?"

that's straight-up trash, socrates; you’re twisting words in the most damaging way for the argument.

not at all, my good sir, i said; i'm just tryna get your drift and wish you'd drop some clearer deets.

"well," he said, "haven't you peeped that there are diff types of government out there; like, tyrannies, democracies, and aristocracies?"

yup, i know.

and, like, the government is the main ruling force in each state, right?

for sure.

and yo, check it: different types of gov – whether they’re democratic, aristocratic, or straight-up tyrannical – drop laws that are all about boosting their own clout; these laws, crafted just to hype up their own agenda, are the “justice” they serve to their squad, and anyone who steps outta line gets yeeted as a lawbreaker and called totally unjust. that's what i mean when i say that in every state, the vibe of justice is the same – it’s all just the gov’s own hustle; and since the gov’s gotta be all about that power, the only logical flex is that everywhere, justice is really just the interest of the stronger. no cap.

aight, i got you, i said; and whether you’re on point or not, i'm gonna dive in. but gotta drop this tea: in your definition of justice, you peeped the word “interest” – even though you told me not to drop it – except you sneaked in “of the stronger” on top.

a small add-on, you gotta admit, he said.

big or small, who cares – first, we gotta see if what you're saying is the real tea. now we both vibe that justice is some kinda interest, but then you add “of the stronger”; and honestly, i'm not 100 on that extra drop, so i gotta look a lil deeper.

proceed.

i will; first off, tell me—do you vibe that it’s legit for subjects to obey their rulers?

i do.

but check it: are state rulers totally flawless, or do they sometimes mess up?

for real, he replied, they def slip up.

so when they craft their laws, sometimes they nail it, and sometimes they totally clown?

true.

when they’re on point, their laws vibe with their own interests; but when they’re off, they end up with laws that go against their own hustle—you feel me?

yes.

and these laws have to be followed by their peeps—and that's what you call justice?

no cap.

so then, by your logic, justice isn’t just about the subjects riding the wave for the stronger’s gains, but also, like, the flip side?

what are you even sayin? he asked.

i'm just rehashing your own words, i believe. but check this: haven’t we already agreed that rulers can be off on what they think their own interest is when they drop orders, and yet obeying them is still called justice? that was already a given, right?

yes.

then you gotta admit that justice isn’t really about serving the stronger’s interest when rulers accidentally order stuff that actually hurts them. cuz if, as you say, justice is just the subjects doing what they're told, then oh wisest of men, can we dodge the truth that the weak end up forced to do not what benefits the stronger, but what harms the stronger?

nothing’s clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.

yeah, said cleitophon, jumping in, if you want me as witness.

but no cap, no witness needed, said polemarchus, 'cause thrasymachus already admitted that rulers sometimes drop orders that don't even boost their own game, and yet following them is still called justice.

yeah, polemarchus—thrasymachus said that subjects doing what their rulers dictate is justice.

yeah, cleitophon, but he also slid that justice equals the stronger’s interest, and while confessing both moves, he also admitted that the stronger might order the weaker to do stuff that isn’t even in his favor; hence, justice ends up being about the injury just as much as it’s about the gains for the stronger.

but, cleitophon said, what he meant by the stronger’s “interest” was just what the stronger thought was his own flex—that’s what the weak had to handle; and he crowned that as justice.

that’s not exactly what he said, shot back polemarchus.

nm, i replied, if he’s now saying that, let’s just roll with it. tell me, thrasymachus, did you really mean by justice what the stronger thinks is his interest, whether that’s on point or just a cap?

certainly not, he said. do you really think that i call a dude who’s off his game “the stronger” just 'cause he’s mistaken?

yep, i said, i got the vibe that you did that when you admitted that rulers aren’t infallible and can totally mess up.

you be arguing like a snitch, socrates. are you saying, for example, that a doc who misdiagnoses isn’t really a doc while he’s tripping? or that someone who flops in math or grammar is still tagged as a math whiz or wordsmith at the time of the goof, with the mistake just being a slip? true, we say that the doc or the math whiz made a mistake, but that’s just how we chat; the real tea is that no legit grammarian or expert ever messes up while they’re truly dope at what they do—they only slip when their game is off, and then they ain’t that skilled no more. no true artist, sage, or ruler slips up while they’re fully in their role; even if folks be saying they do, that's just common talk. but for the sake of mad accuracy—since you’re all about that detail—we should say that a ruler, as long as he’s in ruler mode, is unerring, and being unerring, always drops commands that serve his own clout; and his subjects are obliged to follow. so, like i said from the jump, justice is the interest of the stronger.

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i seriously come off as that snitch, huh?

certainly, he replied.

and you think i'm tossing these questions just to roast you in this debate?

nah, he replied, ‘suppose’ isn’t the right word—I know it; but you’re gonna get clapped, and with just your arguments, you’ll never come out on top.

i ain't tryna go there, my dear man; but to keep it 100 for the future, lemme ask: when you talk about a ruler or the stronger—whose interest, as you dropped, is so thought to be their own flex that the weaker must follow—is that a ruler in the everyday, popular sense or in the strictly legit sense?

in the strictest sense possible, he said. and now, go ahead and play that snitch game if you wanna; i’m not asking for mercy. but trust, you’ll never ever pull it off.

and you really think, i said, that i'm such a lunatic as to try and hustle a cheat, thrasymachus? that’d be like trying to shave a lion, fr fr.

why, he said, you already tried it like a minute ago and flopped.

alright, enough of this pleasantry, i said. let’s cut to the chase: is the true physician—a real one in that strict sense—a healer of the sick or just a coin-chaser?

a healer of the sick, he replied.

and what about the pilot—that is, the real pilot—is he the captain of his sailors or just riding shotgun as a regular sailor?

a captain of sailors.

the fact that he’s on the ship doesn’t count; he’s not just a sailor. the title “pilot” is all about his mad skills and his boss-level authority over the crew.

facts, he said.

now, i said, every art has its own vibe or interest, right?

certainly.

for which it’s gotta scope out and deliver?

yes, that’s the whole aim of art.

and the point of any art is to be perfect—nothing more, nothing less?

what do you mean?

i mean, peep this negative example using the body. if you asked me whether the body can handle itself or if it’s got needs, i’d say: for sure, the body has needs; it can get sick and need fixing, and that’s exactly why the art of medicine is in the game—it’s there to serve the body’s interests, as you'd agree. right?

quite right, he replied.

but then, is the art of medicine—or any art for that matter—guilty of being buggy or missing something, like how an eye might not see well or an ear might not catch sound, and therefore need another art to step in? in other words, is any art prone to glitches that require extra fixes over and over, or do arts only worry about their own subject’s vibe? or are they straight-up flawless, with no need for any extra patch-up, since they’re perfect as long as they stick to what they’re about? using your super precise terms, tell me—am i right?

yes, clearly.

then medicine isn’t looking out for its own bag, but for the body’s vibe, right?

true, he said.

and same with, say, horsemanship—it’s not about the art itself but about what’s best for the horse; no art cares for itself 'cause they got no needs—they only serve what their subject requires.

true, he said.

but surely, thrasymachus, aren’t the arts like total bosses over their own subjects?

he agreed, but with a serious hint of hesitation.

then, i said, no science or art is out here hyping up the stronger's own gains; they’re only about boosting the subject’s vibe, the weaker ones.

he tried to argue back a bit, but eventually chilled and agreed.

then, i continued, no real physician, while in doc mode, is out here thinking about his own profit when prescribing—they’re all about the patient’s good; after all, the true doc is like a ruler with the human body as his domain, not some coin-flipping hustle; we’re on the same page, yeah?

yes.

and the pilot too, in the strict sense, is the boss of the sailors—not just another sailor on deck?

that was agreed.

and such a pilot, as the ruler, dishes out orders that serve the sailors’ vibe, not his own or the boss’s profit?

he muttered a reluctant “yes.”

then, i said, thrasymachus, no ruler—while in full ruler mode—cares about boosting his own bag; he’s always laser-focused on what’s best for his subjects or what works for his art. that’s the only thing he ever considers in all his moves.

at this point in the debate, when everyone peeped that the whole definition of justice was totally flipped on its head, thrasymachus, instead of clapping back, hit me with: “tell me, socrates, you got a nurse?”

why you droppin’ that question, i said, when you should be spitting your own bars?

'cause she lets you snivel and never even wipes your nose—she didn’t even school you on who’s the real shepherd and who’s just a sheep.

what makes you say that? i replied.

'cause you’re tripping thinking that a shepherd fattens up his sheep or oxen for their own good—like he’s at some fancy dinner or chowing down at a banquet, or even hustling as a trader on the market—instead of actually looking out for his own boss vibes; and you even imagine that true state rulers never see their subjects as sheep, always scheming for their own gain day and night. nah fam; you’re so off-base about what’s just and unjust that you don’t even realize justice and the just are really all about someone else’s gain—that is, the ruler’s interest and the loss for the subject, while injustice is the flip side. the unjust boss gets all the clout over the genuinely simple and just crew: he’s the stronger, and his subjects do what perks up his hustle and serve his happiness, which is mad far from being their own. think on it, most foolish socrates—the just always end up taking an L compared to the unjust. first, in private deals: whenever a just person teams up with an unjust one, when the partnership breaks, the unjust dude always walks away with more, and the just gets played. second, when dealing with the state: with income tax, the just pays way more and the unjust way less on the same stack; and when there’s any loot to be had, the unjust pockets big while the just comes up empty. also peep what happens when they step into office: the just man ends up neglecting his own grind, maybe suffers extra losses, and gets zilch from the public ‘cause he’s too busy being honest; plus, his mates roast him for refusing to serve them through shady means. but flip that script for the unjust man. i’m talking big-scale injustice here where the upside for the unjust is crystal clear; and it hits hardest when we peep the highest form of injustice—where the criminal is living his best life and the ones who stick to being just end up totally miserable—that’s tyranny, where by straight-up fraud and force, he rakes off everyone else’s property, not little by little but on the down-low wholesale; scooping up the sacred with the profane, the private with the public; for if he got caught doing any one of these moves solo, he’d get smashed with punishment and mad disgrace—those solo wrongdoers get tagged as temple robbers, man-stealers, burglars, swindlers, and thieves. but when a dude goes all out—snatching cash and even turning citizens into slaves—then instead of getting roasted with those names, he’s hailed as happy and blessed by not only his own people but by everyone who hears he maximized injustice. 'cause people call out injustice not just ‘cause they’re too woke to do it themselves, but ‘cause they’re scared they might get hit next. so, as i’ve been droppin, socrates, when injustice runs on a big scale, it’s got mad strength, freedom, and control compared to justice; and like i said from the start, justice is just the interest of the stronger, while injustice is all about a man’s own profit and hustle.

after dropping that massive bath-man flow, thrasymachus was lowkey about to dip. but the squad wasn’t having it—they insisted he stay and defend his stance; and i even threw in my humble ask for him to stick around. “yo, thrasymachus,” i said, “your points are hella suggestive! you really gonna bounce before schooling us on whether they’re legit or not? is figuring out how we all level up in life such a minor side hustle for you?”

and do i seem any different from you on how important this deep dive is? he said.

you honestly seem like you couldn’t give a damn about us, thrasymachus—whether we live better or worse ‘cause of not knowing what you claim to know is all just blah to you. come on, friend, don’t keep your wisdom locked up; we’re a whole squad, and any glow-up you drop on us will get mad props. as for me, i’m out here saying i’m not convinced, and i don’t think injustice is more profitable than justice—even if you let it run wild. even if there’s some unjust dude out here pulling shady moves by fraud or brute force, that still doesn’t convince me that injustice is the superior flex, and maybe others are feeling the same. maybe we’re off; if that’s the tea, drop your wisdom and show us we’re wrong about preferring justice over injustice.

and how am i supposed to convince you, he said, if you’re not already shook by what i just dropped? what else can i do? you want me to implant the proof straight into your soul?

heaven forbid! i said; i’m just asking you to keep it consistent—if you switch up, do it out in the open, no shady vibes. i gotta note, thrasymachus, if you remember what you dropped earlier: even though you started by defining the true physician in a super exact way, you totally lost that precision when talking about the shepherd; you were trippin’ thinking that a shepherd, in his role, tends the sheep not for their own good but like he’s feasting at a banquet or hustling as a market trader, instead of being a real shepherd. but for real, the art of the shepherd is only about the good of his crew; he just has to serve the best for them, since an art is already on lock once all its boxes are ticked. and that’s what i was saying about the ruler too. i figured the art of ruling—whether in a state or in private life—should only be about the good of his flock, while you seem to think that state rulers—the true bosses—are all about flexing their own authority.

think! nah, i’m mad sure of it.

then why is it that for lesser gigs, no one’s tryna take ’em without getting paid, unless they believe they're governing for the squad’s gain and not just for themselves? lemme ask: aren’t the different arts, by nature, all about their own separate functions? and, my illustrious friend, spit your truth so we can actually make some progress.

yes, that’s the diff, he replied.

and each art drops its own special perk and not just a general vibe—medicine, for instance, gives you health; navigation gives you safe waves at sea, and so on?

yes, he said.

and the art of payment has the unique job of dishing out cash—but don’t get it twisted with other arts, just like the art of the pilot isn’t the same as the art of medicine, even if a sea trip might boost a pilot’s health. you wouldn’t say that navigation equals medicine, right, if we gotta stick to your exact words?

certainly not.

nor would you say that because a dude's vibing in good health after getting paid, that the art of payment is medicine?

i wouldn’t.

and you feel that the benefit of each art is locked to that art alone?

yes.

then, if there’s any perk all artists share, it’s gotta come from something they all use in common?

true, he replied.

and when an artist benefits by getting paid, that extra boost comes from the separate art of payment, which isn’t actually his main craft?

he grumbled a reluctant “yes.”

so, the cash flow isn’t derived directly from each artist’s own art. the real tea is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of building drops a crib, there’s always that extra art of pay in the mix. each art does its own thing and boosts its own subject, but would an artist even gain any clout from his craft unless he also got paid?

i suppose not.

but does that mean he drops zero benefit when he works for free?

definitely, he still drops benefits.

now, thrasymachus, there’s zero doubt: neither arts nor governments are in it for their own bag; as we were saying, they rule and boost the interests of their subjects—the weaker ones, not the strong—catering to their good, not that of the superior. and that, my dear thrasymachus, is why, like i was just saying, no one’s hyped to govern; cuz no one wants to fix problems that aren’t even their own drama without getting some form of payment. when a true artist’s out here doing his work and dishing orders, he never weighs his own hustle—he’s all about what’s best for his subjects; so for rulers to be down to rule, they gotta get paid in one of three ways: cash money, mad honor, or even a penalty for frontin’.

yo, what you tryna say, socrates? said glaucon. the first two ways of gettin’ paid are hella clear, but the penalty part? i’m straight-up lost on how a penalty can even count as cash.

dude, you seriously ain’t gettin’ that this “payment” – the ultimate flex for the real ones to rule – is the big motivator? obviously, you know that chasin’ clout and mad greed are seen as total cringe, no cap.

facts.

and for that reason, i said, money and honor ain’t on their vibe; the real ones don’t wanna be out here openly demanding fees for runnin’ things and gettin’ tagged as mere hirelings, nor do they wanna sneakily dip into the public loot and get labeled as thieves. since they’re not extra about the cash grind, honor just isn’t their jam. so, necessity has gotta be slapped on 'em, and they’re forced into servin’ outta straight-up fear of punishment. i guess that’s why steppin’ up to take office on your own terms—rather than waitin’ to get pushed in—gets called dishonorable.

and the worst part? if you bounce on rulership, you might end up bein’ ruled by someone even wackier than you. that fear, i reckon, forces the good ones to grab the reins—not 'cause they’re hyped for perks, but simply because they can’t pass the buck to someone better (or even as good as themselves). there’s real talk in thinkin’ that if a city were built entirely of solid peeps, dodgin’ office would be just as much a hot mess as snaggin’ it now; that’d straight-up prove that the true boss isn’t meant to chase personal gain but has to look out for the squad. anyone in the know would rather pocket a benefit from someone else than waste time dishin’ one out themselves.

i’m nowhere near vibin’ with thrasymachus’ idea that justice is just the interest of the strong. now, this later question doesn’t need much more deep-divin’ for now; but when thrasymachus drops that the crooked life is more lit than the just life, that new claim hits way harder. so, which of us is spillin’ the truth? and, glaucon, which life you dig more?

i, for my part, think that livin’ just is hella more advantageous, he answered.

yo, did you catch all the extra perks thrasymachus was spittin’ about for the crooked path?

yeah, i heard his spiel, he replied – but honestly, it didn’t flex enough to convince me.

then, shall we try to show him that his claims are straight-up bogus?

most certainly, he replied.

if, i said, he drops a fixed speech and we hit back with our own lit rundown of the advantages of bein’ just, and he answers and we counter-rap, then we’d just be countin’ and comparin’ the perks on both sides – eventually needin’ a squad of judges to decide; but if we keep our convo real, swapping admissions like we did before, we’d basically merge the roles of judge and lawyer in our own crew.

big mood, he said.

and which method you feel is best? i asked.

the one you just proposed.

aight, then, thrasymachus, i said, let’s rewind to the start: you claim that flawless injustice is way more gainful than flawless justice?

yup, that’s my vibe, and i’ve already dropped my reasons.

so, do you peep one as straight-up virtue and the other as pure vice?

certainly.

so, you’re sayin’ justice equals virtue and injustice equals vice?

what a cute idea! especially since i’m reppin’ injustice as profitable while justice comes off as meh.

what else you got then?

the opposite, he replied.

and would you tag justice as vice?

nah, i’d say it’s pure, sublime simplicity.

so then, would you call injustice malignity?

nah – i’d label it all about discretion.

but yo, do you peep that the crooked peeps come off as wise and dope?

yeah, he said; at least the ones who can nail perfect injustice and have the muscle to boss around states and nations – though maybe you think i’m just talkin’ about lowkey cutpurses. even that shady hustle, if it flies under the radar, has some perks, though they can’t really compare to the ones i just mentioned.

i ain’t tryna diss your meaning, thrasymachus, i replied; but fr, i’m shook that you’re mixin’ injustice with wisdom and virtue, and callin’ justice the total opposite.

yup, i definitely do that.

so, i said, you’re standin’ on some deep, almost unanswerable ground; like, if the injustice you’ve been hypin’ as profitable was also admitted (by you and others) to be straight-up vice and ugliness, then we could’ve shot back with classic principles. but now, i see you’re callin’ injustice honorable and strong, and you’re slappin’ all the same qualities on the crooked that we used to drop on the just – you don’t even blink when you pair injustice with wisdom and virtue.

you read my mind, he replied.

then i certainly won’t back down from this debate as long as i’m feelin’ you, thrasymachus, keepin’ it 100; i totally believe you’re now all in and not just clownin’ at our expense.

i might be dead serious or not, but that’s on you—to shut down the argument is your gig.

facts, i said; that’s my job. but can you answer one more thing? does a just dude try to score extra over another just dude?

nah, on the flip—if he did, he wouldn’t be that chill, low-key vibe creature he is.

and would he ever try to level up past just doin’ what’s right?

he wouldn’t.

so, if he tried to one-up the crooked, would he see it as just or totally off?

he’d think it’s on the up-and-up and try to grab that edge; but he just wouldn’t be able to pull it off.

whether he can or can’t is beside the point, i said; the real tea is whether a just dude, while not tryna outdo another just dude, still wants and claims to have more than the crooked ones?

yep, he would.

and what about the crooked—do they try to score more than the just and do things that aren’t on the level?

of course, he said, ‘cause they’re all about flexin’ to have more than everybody else.

true.

so, rephrase it like this, i said—the just dude only wants more than his non-just crew, not more than his equals, whereas the crooked ones aim to snag more than both their own squad and the outsiders.

nothing, he said, can top that level.

and does that mean the crooked are smart and dope while the just aren’t?

good, he said.

and isn’t it that the crooked are on the same wavelength as the wise and dope, while the just are totally not part of that club?

obviously, he said – if you’re built with that real vibe, you’re just like others who are too; if not, you ain’t.

so, i said, every person is basically what their crew is, right?

certainly, he replied.

solid, thrasymachus, i said; now switch it up to the arts: you cool with sayin’ one dude can be a musician while another isn’t?

yeah.

so, which one’s baller and which one’s basic?

obviously, the musician’s the smart one, and the non-musician comes off as clueless.

and he’s good when he’s on point, and bad when he’s off?

yup.

and you’d drop the same for a physician?

yeah.

and tell me, my excellent friend, do you think a musician, when fine-tunin’ his lyre, would ever try to flex by outperformin’ another musician at adjusting the strings?

i don’t think so.

but he’d definitely wanna outshine a non-musician, right?

of course.

and what about a physician? when handin’ out meats and drinks, would he try to one-up another physician or even the whole med game?

he wouldn’t.

but he’d for sure wanna outdo someone who isn’t a doctor?

yes.

and when it comes to knowledge versus ignorance in general, would any brainiac ever wanna flex by sayin’ or doin’ more than another brainiac? wouldn’t he rather just keep it on the same level as his fellow smart peeps?

that, i suppose, is pretty obvious.

and what about the clueless ones? wouldn’t they be all about havin’ more than both the smart and the clueless?

i dare say.

and the knowledgeable are wise, right?

yes.

and the wise are good?

true.

so, the wise and dope dudes wouldn’t try to snag more than their own crew, but only more than those outside it?

i guess so.

while the trash and clueless ones wanna grab more than everyone else?

yes.

but didn’t we say, thrasymachus, that the crooked go beyond both their own squad and the outsiders? wasn’t that your own drip?

they were.

and you also dropped that the just won’t go beyond their own crew but only target the outsiders?

yes.

so, that means the just are like the wise and dope, and the crooked like the evil and clueless?

that’s the takeaway.

and each person is exactly what their crew is?

that’s a given.

so, in the end, the just come off as wise and dope, and the crooked as evil and clueless.

thrasymachus admitted all this – not in a smooth flow like i just recapped, but with major reluctance; it was a scorchin’ summer day, and sweat was drip-droppin’ off him in torrents; and then i peeped something i’d never seen before – thrasymachus straight-up blushed.

since we were now on the same page that justice equals virtue and wisdom, and injustice equals vice and ignorance, i bounced to another topic:

aight, i said, thrasymachus, that matter’s settled; but didn’t we also say that injustice got mad strength – you feel me?

yeah, i remember, he said, but don’t go thinkin’ i’m vibin’ with your take or that i’ve got no comeback; if i were to drop an answer, you’d totally call me out for goin’ off; so either let me spill my tea, or if you wanna fire questions, do it, and i’ll hit you with a “very good” – like how they nod at those old storytellers – and drop a yes or no.

def not, i said, if it ain’t really your vibe.

yeah, he said, i will – just to keep you happy, since you ain’t lettin’ me speak. what else you want?

nothing in the world, i said; and if you’re down, i’ll ask and you gotta answer.

fire away.

then, i’ll repeat the question i dropped before, so our deep dive into justice versus injustice stays on track. someone said that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, but now that we’ve pegged justice as wisdom and virtue, it’s clear that justice beats injustice (if injustice is just straight-up ignorance) – and that’s unarguable. but i wanna flip the script, thrasymachus: you ain’t gonna disagree that a state can be totally crooked and even try to enslave other states, or might already have 'em on lockdown, right?

true, he replied; and i’d add that the dopest, most perfectly crooked state is the prime candidate to do that.

i know, i said, that’s your whole vibe; but here’s my twist: can that mad power of the top state roll without justice, or does it only pop off when justice is in the mix?

if you’re right and justice equals wisdom, then it only rolls with justice; but if i’m right, then it can run wild without justice.

i’m straight-up vibin’, thrasymachus, seeing you nod both yes and no and droppin’ some fire answers.

that’s just courtesy for you, he replied.

you’re too kind, i said; now do me a solid and tell me—do you think a state, an army, or even a crew of robbers and thieves (or any gang of evildoers) could even roll if they started messin’ with each other?

nah, for sure, he said – they wouldn’t last.

but if they kept it chill and didn’t hurt each other, then they could squad up better?

yeah.

and that’s 'cause crookedness just sparks mad divisions, beef, and chaos, while justice drops harmony and squad goals; right, thrasymachus?

i totally vibe with that, he said, ‘cause i’m not tryna throw hands with you.

mad props, i said; but i gotta know—since injustice always courts beef wherever it pops off (among slaves or free peeps), wouldn’t it just make everyone turn on each other and wreck any chance of squad action?

definitely.

and even if only two peeps are doin’ injustice, wouldn’t they end up beefin’ and clashing, turnin’ enemy not only with each other but with the just crowd too?

they sure will.

and if injustice chills in just one person, do you reckon they lose their natural power or keep it?

let’s assume they keep their power.

but seriously, isn’t the force of injustice such that wherever it sets up shop – be it in a city, an army, a fam, or any crew – that squad ends up all over the place, unable to unite ‘cause of constant sedition and distraction? doesn’t it turn them into their own worst enemy and start beef with anyone that opposes them, including the just?

yes, totally.

and isn’t injustice just as fatal when it’s locked in one person – first makin’ him unable to act 'cause he’s not vibin’ with himself, and second, turnin’ him into an enemy of both himself and the just? true, thrasymachus?

yes.

and yo, my dude, i said, the gods are legit just, right?

granted they are.

but if that’s the case, then the crooked are basically enemies of the gods, and the just are on the gods’ squad?

feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; i won’t step in, ‘cause i ain’t tryna ruffle the squad’s vibes.

alright then, drop your answers, and let me grab the rest of my snack. we already showed that the just are hella smarter, better, and more boss than the crooked, and the crooked can’t squad up at all; plus, talkin’ 'bout totally evil dudes ever vibin’ together is off – ‘cause if they were completely evil, they’d just end up clashing with each other; clearly, there’s some leftover justice in 'em that even lets them combine – otherwise, they’d wreck each other along with their victims. they’re just half-ass villains in their hustle; if they were full-on villains and utterly crooked, they’d be completely incapable of rollin’. that’s the real tea, not what you dropped at first. but whether the just live a way better, happier life than the crooked is another level we gotta dive into. i reckon they do, based on all the deets i just laid out; but i still wanna break it down further, ‘cause we’re talkin’ about the very rule of human life here.

fire away.

now, imma ask: wouldn’t you say a horse has a purpose?

i would.

and the purpose or use of a horse – or of anything – is basically that thing which no other tool can hit, or can’t hit as hard?

i’m not vibin’ – what’s that mean? he said.

lemme break it down: can you see without using your eyes?

certainly not.

or hear without your ears?

nope.

so, these are legit the purposes of those organs, right?

they are.

but yo, you can cut a vine branch with a dagger or a chisel, or a bunch of other tools, right?

of course.

but not as smoothly as with a pruning-hook made for that exact job?

true.

so, can we say that the purpose of a pruning-hook is exactly that?

we can.

now, i think you’re catchin’ my drift about askin’ whether the purpose of anything is that which no other thing can do, or can’t do as well.

i get your meaning, he said, noddin’ in agreement.

and that whatever’s got a purpose also has its own excellence? do i really need to ask if the eye’s got a purpose?

it does.

and doesn’t the eye also have some mad excellence?

yes.

and the ear’s got a purpose and its own excellence too?

true.

and same goes for all other things – each thing has a purpose and its own special excellence?

exactly.

so, can eyes even do their job if they lose their own inherent swag and end up with defects?

how would they, he said, if they’re blind and can’t see?

you mean, if they lose the very excellence that is sight? but i’m not there yet. i just wanna ask generally whether things that nail their purpose do so because they got the proper excellence, and if they’re deficient, they totally flop.

definitely, he replied.

i could say the same for ears; when they lose their proper excellence, they can’t hit their purpose, right?

true.

and that vibe applies to everything else too?

i agree.

now, what about the soul – doesn’t it have a purpose that nothing else can fulfill? like, to boss up, command, deliberate, and all that? aren’t those functions totally meant for the soul, and can’t be handed off to anyone else?

to literally no one else.

and ain’t life itself one of the soul’s major goals?

assuredly, he said.

and doesn’t the soul also have its own dope excellence?

yes.

so, can it still nail its goals if it’s stripped of that excellence?

it just can’t.

then, an evil soul is bound to be a wack ruler and boss, while a good soul is gonna be a lit ruler, right?

yes, no cap, necessarily.

and we already dropped that justice is the soul’s supreme excellence and injustice is its major flaw?

that’s locked in.

so, the just soul and the just dude will live dope, and the crooked dude will live rough?

that’s exactly what your argument proves.

and the one livin’ well is blessed and happy, while the one livin’ rough is basically cursed and miserable?

certainly.

so, the just are happy and the crooked are miserable?

so be it.

but bein’ happy instead of miserable is where the real profit is at.

of course.

then, my blessed thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable than justice.

let this, socrates, he said, be your binge-worthy entertainment at the bendidea.

for that, i’m kinda owe you, i said, now that you’ve chilled out and stopped throwin’ shade at me. still, i wasn’t exactly entertained – but that’s on me, not you. like, it’s as if an epicurean dude grabs a taste of every dish as they roll by without ever stoppin’ to savor the last one; so i hopped from one topic to the next without actually nailin’ down what i originally sought – the real nature of justice. i bailed on that quest and switched gears to debate whether justice equals virtue and wisdom or is just pure evil and dumb; and when another question about the perks of justice versus injustice popped off, i couldn’t help but dive in. and the final tea of this whole sesh? i know nothin’ at all. i got no clue what justice really is, so i can’t say whether it’s a virtue or a flop, nor can i tell if the just dude’s truly happy or totally bummed out.
