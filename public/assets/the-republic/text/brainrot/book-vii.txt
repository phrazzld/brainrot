book vii.

and now, let me flex a lit image of just how enlightened or, frankly, sus our nature can be: behold—human beings living in an underground cave, which has one big open mouth facing the light that vibes along the whole cave; these peeps have been stuck here since childhood, with their legs and necks chained so they can only peep straight ahead, locked in by the chains so no head-turning is allowed. above and behind them, a fire is blazin' in the distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there's a raised walkway; and if you squint, you’ll catch a low wall built along that way, sorta like the screen puppet masters use to show off their marionettes.

"i see," he said.

and do you see, i continued, dudes (or dudettes) cruising along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, statues, and figures of animals made of wood, stone, or whatever random material, which pop up over the wall? some of 'em spit out chatter, while others are dead silent.

"you just dropped a wild image on me—these prisoners are seriously sus," he said.

"exactly like us," i replied; "and they only peep their own shadows or the shadows of each other, which the fire throws on the far wall of the cave?"

"true dat," he said; "how else would they see but the shadows when they can’t even turn their heads?"

"and for the stuff that’s carried along, they'd only peep the shadow drip?"

"deadass," he said.

"and if they started chatting with each other, wouldn't they think they were naming the actual objects that were passing by?"

"for real," he replied.

and picture this: if the cave even had an echo bouncing from the other side, wouldn't they be tripping when one of the passersby speaks, thinking that the voice they hear is coming straight from the rolling shadow?

"no question," he said.

to them, i said, the truth would literally be nothing but the shadow memes of the images.

"that’s on point," he said.

and now, peep this: imagine what naturally goes down if the prisoners get freed and get a serious reality check. initially, when one of them is yeeted out and forced to stand up, twist his neck around, and walk toward the light, his brain's gonna get hit with some brutal pain; the glare will be extra, and he won’t be able to peep the real objects that back when he only saw the shadow drip; then, imagine someone telling him, like, "yo, what you saw before was just an illusion, but now, as you creep closer to the real, your vision is leveling up"—what’s gonna be his clapback? picture further that his teacher starts pointing at the objects as they roll by and making him name them—wouldn't he be totally shook? wouldn’t he think that the shadow memes he used to peep were actually more on point than these new objects?

"totally," he said.

and if he’s forced to glance straight into the light, wouldn't his eyes beg for mercy and make him turn away, retreating to the objects he can handle, which he’d think are, in fact, clearer than the stuff being thrown at him now?

"true dat," he said.

and imagine one more time, he’s reluctantly dragged up a steep, rough-as-heck climb, and held down until he’s forced into face time with the sun itself—wouldn't he be all kinds of pained and irritated? coming closer to the light would totally dazzle his eyes, leaving him unable to peep any of what the normies call realities.

"not all in one sec," he said.

he’s gonna need to get used to the upper world’s vibe. first, he’ll nail the shadows, then the reflections of dudes and other objects in water, and next, the objects in the flesh; after that, he’ll be vibing with the glow of the moon and stars and that spangled heaven, and by night, the sky and star-memes will be clearer than the sun’s drip by day, right?

"for sure," he said.

lastly, he’ll be able to scope out the sun—not just as a watered-down reflection in the water, but peep it in its legit spot, not some remix vibe; and he’ll be chilling, contemplating it exactly as it is.

"definitely," he said.

he’ll then drop the knowledge that this luminous boss is the one who flexes the seasons and the years, the guardian of everything lit in the visible world, and in a way, the underlying cause of all the dope stuff he and his squad have been used to peeping.

"clearly," he said, "first he scopes the sun, then he wins at it."

and when he remembers his old crib and his old crew of cave-dwellers, wouldn’t he be all hyped about his glow-up while feeling a bit sorry for the ones still stuck in the dark?

"obviously, he’d be lowkey salty," he said.

and suppose further that the prisoners used to hand out mad honors among themselves for who could peep the quickest on the rolling shadows, who was riding ahead, who followed, and who could best spit conclusions about what’s coming next—do you reckon he’d be down for that hype or straight-up roast those clout-chasers? wouldn’t he be like, quoting homer,

"better to be the poor servant of a poor master,"

and be okay with catching any l rather than buying into their fake clout and living that miserable life?

"deadass," he said, "i think he'd take any loss rather than keep rocking those bogus vibes and living in that trash state."

now, imagine once more, a dude who’s just been yeeted out of the sun and then slammed back into his old cave spot—wouldn’t his eyes be so filled with darkness that he’s completely lost?

"for sure," he said.

and if there was, like, a contest where he had to measure shadow drip alongside the peeps who never left the cave, while his sight’s still on beta mode (and it might take forever to get that upgrade), wouldn’t that be a total meme? folks would be like, "yo, he went up and came down without his eyes on fleek!" and say it's better not to even think about ascending; and if anyone even dared to yeet another up to the light, just cuff that offender and yeet him out for real.

"no doubt," he said.

this whole allegory, i said, you can now slap on to our earlier argument, dear glauccon—the cave’s the world of sight, the fire’s glow is the sun, and don't get it twisted if you peep the upward journey as the soul’s epic ascent into the intellectual realm, according to my humble vibe, which—if you’re down—I’ve dropped, whether spot-on or off, only the gods know. but, true or false, my take is that in the world of knowledge, the idea of the good shows up last and only after a struggle; and once seen, it’s also decoded as the universal source of all things bomb and right, the parent of light and the big boss of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual squad; and that’s the flex anyone trying to act rationally in public or private life must have their eyes locked on.

"i agree," he said, "as far as i can peep you."

moreover, i said, don't get it twisted that those who hit that beatific vision are gonna ghost on human drama; their souls are always sprinting toward the upper world where they wanna chill—which is hella natural, if our allegory’s on point.

"yes, very natural," he replied.

and is it wild when someone jumps from divine contemplation to the lame state of mortal life, misbehaving in an absolute clownish way; if, while his eyes are blinking and he hasn’t yet adjusted to the dark, he’s forced to throw down in courts of law or other spots, debating the images or just the shadow memes of justice, and trying to match wits with peeps who’ve never even peeped true justice?

"nothing but wild, i’d say," he replied.

anyone with common sense will recall that the eye’s trippin’ comes in two flavors, and stems from two causes—either from bouncing out of the light or crashing into it—and that’s as true for the mind’s eye as it is for the actual eyes; and if someone remembers this when they peep a dude with a wobbly, confused vision, they won’t be too quick to laugh—first they’ll be like, "yo, did that soul just emerge from a lit life and can’t handle the dark, or did he just flip from dark to day and get blinded by all that extra light?" and they’ll count one as being fortune’s favorite and feel pity for the other; or, if they’re in a mood to laugh at the soul that comes up from below into the light, there’s more reason to roast him than the dude who bounces from the light back into the cave.

"that’s a hella just distinction," he said.

but then, if i’m right, some of these so-called education professors are totally off when they claim they can just drop a whole new level of knowledge into a soul like it’s some firmware update—like implanting sight into blind peepers.

"they def say that," he replied.

whereas our vibe shows that the learning juice was already in the soul; just like an eye can’t turn from dark to light without the whole body getting involved, the knowledge tool only flips from the world of becoming to that of being when the whole soul moves, slowly leveling up to handle the full drip of being—and especially, the brightest, dopest kind of being, aka the good.

"facts, no cap."

and must there not be some art that can trigger this conversion in the quickest, easiest way; not by implanting sight (since that shiz is already there, just looking the wrong way), but by simply redirecting it so it peeps straight into truth?

"yes," he said, "such an art is def within the realm of possibility."

and while the other so-called virtues of the soul are kinda like bodily stats—‘cause even if they ain’t originally loaded, they can be boosted later by habit and grind—the virtue of wisdom straight-up flexes a divine element that always sticks, and thanks to that, it turns out hella useful and profitable; or else, it can be straight-up toxic and trash. have you ever noticed that narrow sparks of smarts flashing from the cunning eye of a slick rogue—how he’s all hyped, how his tiny soul sees the cheat code to his end; he’s basically the opposite of blind, but his sharp vision gets hijacked into serving evil, and his mischievousness is proportional to his clout?

"deadass true," he said.

but what if back in the day there was a sort of pre-cut for these natures; if in their youth they got snipped away from those heavy sensual pleasures—like munching and sippin’, which, like lead weights, were strapped to them from birth and dragged them down, twisting their vision onto the low-tier—if, i say, they’d been freed from these laggy loads and their gaze got flipped in the opposite direction, then that same eye would peep truth as clearly as it peeps any other lit image right now.

"pretty likely," he said.

yes, i said; and here’s another thing that’s either likely or, more like, a necessary take from all this: neither the uneducated, the truth-clueless, nor even those who never wrap up their never-ending education can be solid ministers of state; not the former because they lack one core vibe of duty that’s the rule over all their actions, private and public alike; and not the latter because they only act when forced, tripping that they’re already living it up ina chill island vibe.

"very true," he replied.

then, i said, the hustle for us who are the OG state-builders is to force the absolute dopest minds to snag that knowledge we already showed to be the ultimate flex—they gotta keep ascending until they hit the good; but once they’ve ascended and peeped enough, we can’t let them ghost the squad like they do now.

"what do you mean?" he asked.

i mean that they should remain chillin' in the upper world—but that vibe isn’t legit in the long run; they must be hauled back down into the cave with those still locked in, and made to share in the grind and even enjoy the honors, whether they’re actually worthy or not.

"but isn’t that super sus?" he said; "should we really drop them into a worse life when they could be living the high life?"

you’ve forgotten, my friend, i said, "the legislator never planned to crown one class as extra happy above the rest; the real hustle was for the whole state to vibe as one, held together by both persuasion and necessity, making everyone a benefactor to one another. he created them not just to get their own clout, but to serve as the ultimate glue binding up the state."

"true," he said, "i almost forgot that."

peep this, glauccon, i said: there’s zero injustice in forcing our philosopher homies to care about the squad—they’ll understand that in other states, dudes like them aren’t obliged to dive into the political grind; and that’s fair 'cause they’re raised on their own chill tempo, and the government basically dips on them. but we brought you into this game to be the rulers of the hive, kings of your own clout and of all the peeps, and we leveled you up way better and more perfectly than those other chumps—so you’re ready for the double duty. therefore, each one of you, when your time drops, must roll down to the common underground spot and get used to seeing in the dark. once you nail that habit, you’ll peep ten thousand times better than those cave dwellers, and you’ll know exactly what all these images mean and represent, ‘cause you’ve seen the beautiful, the just, and the good in all its truth. and that way, our state—which is also yours—will be the real deal, not just some daydream, and run in a vibe unlike those other states where dudes be beefing over mere shadow memes and getting distracted chasing clout, which in their eyes is the top good. the truth is, the state where the rulers are hella reluctant to rule is always the chillest and most on-point, while the state with rulers hyped up on power is just a hot mess.

"most true," he replied.

and when our pupils hear all this, will they straight-up refuse to take their turn in the state grind because they get to chill under heavenly light all day?

"impossible," he answered; "‘cause they're just real peeps, and the orders we drop are legit. there’s zero doubt that each one of them will take on the duty as a hardcore necessity, not in that tricked-out way of our current state rulers."

"yes, my friend," i said; "and here’s the kicker. you gotta design for your future rulers a life that’s next-level better than just that of a standard ruler, and then you’ll have a well-ordered state; ‘cause only in a state that dishes out that upgraded vibe will it be ruled by peeps who are truly rich—not in basic silver and gold, but rich in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. if they slide into public affairs all hungry for their own gain, thinking they’re snatching the chief good, there’ll be zero order; ‘cause they’ll be brawling over office, and the ensuing civil and domestic beef will straight-up ruin the rulers and the entire state.

"most true," he replied.

and the only life that can straight-up diss the hustle for political clout is that of real philosophy. do you even know any other way?

"indeed, i don't," he said.

and should the state rulers even be clout-lovers? ‘cause if they are, rival clout-lovers will pop off and start beefing.

"no question," he concluded.

who then are those we’re low‑key forcing to be our guardians? fr, they’re gonna be the dopest dudes—those who are hella woke on state tea, bossing up the whole setup, and living a life mad superior to basic politics, no cap.

“they are the men, and imma choose ‘em,” he replied.

and now, shall we vibe on how these epic guardians get spawned and totally glow‑up from the darkness into straight-up lit mode—as if they yeeted themselves from the underworld up to the gods?

“bet,” he replied.

“the process, i said, isn’t just about flipping an oyster shell (yo, shoutout to that old‑skool game where peeps bounced or chased based on whether the shell landed dark‑side up or lit‑side up), it’s more like the ultimate soul 180—from a day barely better than night to that true day of being, fam, the ascent from below that we straight up call true philosophy?”

“facts.”

“and shouldn’t we peep which kind of brain fuel can drag the soul from becoming meh to actually being? oh, and btw, remember that our young bloods are supposed to be warrior athletes?”

“yup, that was said.”

“then this new flavor of knowledge gotta bring extra sauce—must be mad useful in war.”

“deadass, if possible.”

“there were two parts in our old‑school edu plan, weren’t there?”

“just so.”

“one part was gym—like the hardcore gym sesh that ran the body’s gains and eventual decay, low‑key linked to generation and corruption, right?”

“true.”

“so that’s not the brain juice we’re tryna uncover?”

“nah.”

“but yo, what about music, which also had a cameo in our previous scheme?”

“music, as you’ll recall, was the yin to gym’s yang—it schooled our guardians through habit vibes, making ‘em harmonious and rhythm‑flexed, but it wasn’t about dropping real science; whether the words were wild tales or maybe even true, they carried the same rhythmic drip. but honestly, music didn’t serve that epic upgrade you’re chasing.”

“spot on, in your recollection; music def didn’t come with that level of truth.”

“so what branch of knowledge, my dear glaucon, has that next‑level vibe we crave, since all our utilitarian arts came off as basic?”

“undoubtedly; but if we ghost music, gym, and the arts too, what’s left?”

“yo, i said, maybe our exclusive subjects are all ghosted—in which case we gotta roll with something basic, a universal flex that every art, science, and brainiac vibes with from the get‑go.”

“so what could that be?”

“it’s gotta be that low‑key skill we all pick up: telling one, two, and three apart—that is, number and calculation. don’t all arts and sciences dip into that pool?”

“yes.”

“then the art of war definitely rides that math wave, right?”

“to be sure.”

“so check it: whenever palamedes pops up in a tragedy, he seriously throws shade at agamemnon, calling him ridiculously unfit as a general. did you not notice how he flexed that he invented numbers—he even counted the ships and lined up the troy troops—implying they’d never been counted before and that agamemnon, like, couldn’t even count his own kicks? if the dude was clueless on numbers, then what kinda general was he supposed to be?”

“i’d say he’d be one weird af general if that’s the tea.”

“can we seriously front that a warrior shouldn’t be dialed into basic arithmetic?”

“certainly he should, if he wants even a smidge of military tactics—or, honestly, if he wants to be a man at all.”

“i wanna know, do you see arithmetic the same way i do?”

“what’s your take?”

“i think it’s exactly the kind of study we need—a vibe that naturally sparks reflection, even if it hasn’t been fully exploited yet; its real mission is to pull the soul from just ‘becoming’ into straight-up being.”

“explain that, fam?” he said.

“i’ll try, i said—just vibe with me and hit a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as i break down which branches of knowledge pack that pull, so we can be 100% sure arithmetic is, like, one of them.”

“explain,” he said.

“i mean, our sense objects come in two vibes: some are so obvious that your senses handle the call without any brain work, while others are mad sus, forcing you to dive deep for the extra deets.”

“you’re straight up talking about how our senses get messed with by distance and all that dope light and shade, huh?”

“nah, i said, that’s not what i meant at all.”

“so what’s the real tea then?”

“when i say ‘uninviting objects’, i mean those that don’t flip from one vibe to its opposite; but ‘inviting objects’ do, where your senses—whether up close or from afar—serve equal deets on both sides. check it: here are three fingers—a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.”

“lit.”

“picture ‘em right in front of you; and here’s the kicker: each one just vibes as a finger—whether seen mid‑range or at the edge, whether white or black, thick or thin—it don’t matter; a finger is a finger, period. so you ain’t gotta ask, ‘what even is a finger?’ because your sight never twists it into something else.”

“true.”

“and so, i said, as expected, there’s nothing here that even triggers deep brainwave.”

“nah, there isn’t,” he replied.

“but what about the scale—big finger, small finger? can our peepers really lock that down? does it matter if one’s in the middle and another on the edge? same with touch—can it really flex on thick versus thin, soft versus hard? like, do our senses ever serve up perfect tea on those vibes? it seems like if a sense catches on hardness, it’s also picking up softness, only hintin’ that the same thing can feel both ways.”

“facts,” he said.

“and like, isn’t the soul gonna be totally bamboozled by getting that a hard vibe can also come off soft? what’s the even meaning of light versus heavy if the same thing can flip between both?”

“yep, he said—those hints the soul gets are hella weird and definitely need some breakdown.”

“exactly, i said, and in these mindfucks, the soul naturally calls in arithmetic and pure intel to figure out if what’s being seen is one thing or split into two.”

“facts.”

“and if it turns out to be two, then each is a distinct unit, right?”

“certainly.”

“and if each is one, yet together they make two, then you clearly see they’re in a state of division—cause if they were undivided, you’d just peep one big vibe.”

“true.”

“the eye might catch both little and big, but in a fuzzy, no‑details manner; it just doesn’t break it down.”

“yes.”

“whereas the thinking mind, tryna clear the chaos, flips the switch and sets little and big apart, no mix‑up.”

“very true.”

“isn’t that where we first started asking, ‘what’s great?’ and ‘what’s small?’”

“exactly so.”

“and that’s how the epic split between what’s visible and what’s understood on a higher level was born.”

“most true.”

“this is exactly what i meant by saying that impressions dropping dual vibes hype the intellect—while those that don’t just leave the brain chillin’.”

“i get it, he said, totally vibing with you.”

“so, where do unity and number even slot in?”

“i dunno,” he replied.

“think about it a bit, and you’ll see that everything i just dropped answers that; cuz if simple unity was obvious to our eyes or any sense, then—just like with the finger—there’d be zero pull toward true being. but when there’s this constant low‑key contradiction, where one flips into its opposite and sparks the idea of many, that’s when the brain kicks into overdrive and the soul, all perplexed, is like, ‘yo, what’s absolute unity?’ and that, fam, is how the study of the one pulls your mind into contemplating true being.”

“and real talk, he said, this totally goes down with one—like, one can be both singular and, like, endless in its vibes?”

“yep, i said; if it holds for one, then it def applies to all numbers.”

“certainly.”

“and arithmetic and all that calculation biz are basically about numbers too, right?”

“yes.”

“and they seriously guide the mind toward the real truth?”

“yes, in a very remarkable manner.”

“so, this is the kind of knowledge we’re on the hunt for—double‑duty for both war and deep philosophy; cuz a warrior who can’t count his troops is straight‑up lost, and a philosopher who ain’t math‑savvy won’t escape the chaotic sea of becoming. hence, he’s gotta be an arithmetic boss.”

“that is true.”

“so our guardian is both a warrior and a philosopher?”

“certainly.”

“then this is the kind of knowledge that laws should be all over—our future top dogs of the state need to be pushed to grind on arithmetic, not as random dabblers, but until they can peep the nature of numbers purely with their minds; not like some merchant tryna hustle for quick cash, but for the sake of killer military moves and that essential soul glow‑up—’cause that’s the easiest ride from just tryna be to full‑on being.”

“that is excellent,” he said.

“yes, i said, and now that we’re on this, gotta drop: arithmetic is super charming and slays in so many ways toward our goals—if you vibe with it like a full‑on philosopher rather than a sketchy shopkeeper!”

“how do you mean?”

“what i mean is, arithmetic seriously elevates the soul—forcing it to flex on abstract numbers and straight‑up rebel against throwing in cringey, tangible distractions. you know how the math masters always roast anyone who even tries to split absolute unity when crunching numbers? like, if you divide, they multiply (either because they consolidate the number by shutting down fraction drama, or they see division as just another form of multiplication, keeping one intact), ensuring that ‘one’ stays pure and doesn’t get lost in a mess of fractions.”

“that is very true.”

“now, suppose some dude rolls up and goes, ‘yo my friends, what’s the low‑down on these epic numbers you’re dropping—numbers with that unity you demand, where every unit is equal, unshakeable, and indivisible?’ what would the math squad say?”

“they’d say, as i figure, that they’re talking about numbers that can only be vibed in the mind.”

“so, you see that this knowledge is truly necessary—demanding pure, unfiltered intelligence to snag real truth?”

“yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.”

“and have you peeped that those who naturally flex on calculation tend to be way quicker on every other type of knowledge? even the basic noobs, if they’ve been schooled in arithmetic, end up way sharper than they’d otherwise be.”

“very true,” he said.

“and honestly, you won’t easily find a study as hardcore as arithmetic.”

“you will not.”

“and for all these reasons, arithmetic is the kind of brainfood that the best peeps should totally train in—and it’s not something we can ever just ghost.”

“i agree.”

“let this be locked in as one of our core edu subjects. and next, are we down to see if its kin science also vibes with us?”

“you mean geometry?”

“exactly so.”

“clearly, he said, we’re all about that side of geometry that’s linked to war; cuz whether you’re pitching a camp, locking down a position, or fine‑tuning the battle lines during a real skirmish or on the march, it’s a total game‑changer if your general is a geometry boss.”

“yes, i said, but for tactical moves a bit of geometry or calc will do the trick; it’s more about that advanced geometry which somehow helps you peep the true idea of good—since everything naturally pushes your soul to lock its gaze on that spot where true perfection of being is, which it def should witness.”

“true,” he said.

“so if geometry makes the soul peep true being, then it’s on our plate; but if it’s just about becoming, nah, it ain’t our vibe.”

“yes, that is what we assert.”

“yet anyone who’s even dipped their toes in geometry will agree that this view totally clashes with the everyday geometric chatter.”

“how so?”

“they stick to hardcore practice—always yapping about squaring, expanding, applying, etc.—totally confusing geometry’s true essence with basic daily needs; but the real aim of geometry is pure, eternal knowledge.”

“certainly,” he said.

“then shouldn’t we drop an extra admission?”

“what admission?”

“that geometry is all about aiming for eternal truth, not just some fleeting, temporary nonsense.”

“that, he replied, is totally fair and true.”

“then, my noble friend, geometry will pull the soul toward truth, spark that philosopher spirit, and elevate what’s now sadly slumping.”

“nothing else is gonna have that kind of impact.”

“so nothing should be more strictly enforced than making sure the peeps of your dope city learn geometry. plus, geometry drops extra bonus vibes that are hella huge.”

“of what kind?” he said.

“i said, there’s the military boost you mentioned; and in every field of knowledge, experience shows that anyone who studies geometry is mad quick on the uptake compared to those who don’t.”

“yes indeed,” he said, “there’s an infinite gap between them.”

“then are we cool with making this our second key edu branch for our youth?”

“let’s do so,” he replied.

“and suppose we add astronomy as branch three—what’s your take?”

“i’m totally down for that,” he said; “tracking seasons, months, and years is as clutch for a general as it is for a farmer or a sailor.”

“i’m low‑key amused, i said, by how you’re tripping about coming off as if you’re forcing useless studies; and i totally get the struggle of believing that every dude’s got a soul‑eye which, when dulled by other lame pursuits, gets re‑illuminated by these teachings—and that it’s way more precious than like, ten thousand physical eyes, since that one eye is the only one that sees pure truth. now, there are basically two kinds of peeps: one squad that digs your words like they’re pure revelations, and another that thinks it’s just idle chatter with zero profit. so, you gotta decide which crew you’re rollin’ with. you’ll probably say you’re here mainly for your own glow‑up, while not minding if others scoop some benefits too.”

“i think i'd rather roll this argument for my own level‑up.”

“then hold up—let’s step back, cuz we've totally messed up the order of our subjects.”

“what did we do wrong?” he asked.

“i said, right after plane geometry, we went full send into solids in revolution instead of chillin’ with solids as they are; we should’ve rolled from the second dimension into the third—the one that’s all about cubes and depth.”

“that is true, socrates; but honestly, there’s mad nothin’ out there on these subjects yet.”

“why, yes, i said, and for two reasons: first, no government is backing them—which kills the energy to chase ‘em since they’re super hard; and second, students can’t really tackle ‘em without a legit director. but a director’s hard to find, and even if one shows up, our ego‑trippin’ students wouldn’t give him a second glance. that’d be different if the whole state was running the show for these studies and giving ‘em mad honor; then disciples would be lining up nonstop and discoveries would be drip‑feeding in. even now, even though the world totally disses them and they’re all outta proportion with no one claiming their use, these subjects push through with natural charm—and if the state had their back, they’d definitely bust into the light someday.”

“yes,” he said, “they got remarkable charm. but i don’t get the switch‑up in order. first, you kicked off with plane geometry?”

“yes,” i said.

“and then you dropped astronomy right after, and then stepped back?”

“yes, and i kinda rushed—sorry; the wack state of solid geometry, which should’ve naturally come next, forced me to skip over it and jump straight to astronomy, aka the motion of solids.”

“true,” he said.

“then assuming that the now‑omitted science would totally drop into existence if given state love, let’s continue with astronomy as the fourth branch.”

“that’s the right order,” he replied.

“and now, socrates, since you clapped down on my lame way of praising astronomy before, my hype will now be in your own epic vibe. because, i honestly think, everyone gotta see that astronomy pushes the soul to look up and lifts us from this world into another.”

“everyone but me,” i said; “for others it might be obvious, but for me it’s still a head‑scratcher.”

“and what then would you say?”

“i’d say that when folks try to elevate astronomy into philosophy, they end up making us look downward instead of upward.”

“what do you mean?” he asked.

“you, i replied, hold this ultra‑sublime concept of knowing the higher things. i dare say that if some dude leans back to study a fancy, fretted ceiling, you’d still reckon that his mind is doing the real perceiving—not his eyes. and you’re probably right, and i might be a noob; but in my view, only that knowledge about true being and what’s unseen makes the soul look up. like, if a guy’s just gawking at the heavens or, on the flip side, staring at the ground trying to scoop some sensory detail, i’d argue he ain’t actually learning—because that stuff isn’t science; his soul’s locked on looking down, whether he’s cruising by water or on foot, floating or just chilling on his back.”

“i acknowledge,” he said, “your roast is legit. still, i’d really like to figure out how astronomy can be learned in a way that seriously vibes with the kind of knowledge we’re talking about.”

yo, listen up fam, i gotta spit you this: the starry heaven we’re lowkey peepin’ is built on a visible drip ground, so even tho it’s the absolute aesthetic and most on-point of all seen stuff, it’s still way inferior to the legit moves of absolute fast vibes and absolute slow vibes—both interlinked and carrying that full-on true number and every prime figure flex. and btw, these moves are for your brain’s big flex, not what you catch with your peepers.

"true," he clapped back.

yo, the lit, spangled heavens are meant to be our blueprint for that higher level knowledge; their glow is like the aesthetic of pics or figures mad mastered by daedalus or some other legendary artist we might randomly peep. any geometry whiz who scopes them would be straight-up shook by the finesse of their craft—but they’d never even entertain the idea of snagging the true equal, the true duplicate, or the actual ratio of any other level of drip.

"nah fam, that idea’s straight-up clownin’," he replied.

and ain’t a real astro influencer gonna vibe the same when he watches the star moves? won’t he think that heaven and all its contents are curated by the ultimate creator in the most flawless way? but yo, he’d never even imagine the ratios of night to day, or day to month, or month to year, or even stars to stars, and all the other visible, material drip being eternal and never glitchin’—that’d be hella absurd; and it’s equally wack to stress so hard over pinning down their exact specs.

i’m deadass vibing with that, though i never peeped it that way before.

then, i dropped some knowledge: in astronomy, just like in geometry, we gotta flex with problems and leave the literal heavens alone if we wanna approach the subject the right way and make that natural brainpower actually count.

"that, my dude, is way above our current astro squad," he said.

"facts, and there’s a whole bunch of other stuff that needs that same insane upgrade if our laws are gonna be on point. but yo, can you hit me with any other dope studies?" i asked.

"nah," he replied, "not without some deep vibes."

"motion, bro, comes in mad flavors—there isn’t just one lane; there are two moves so obvious even to peeps like us, and then there’s extra sauce saved for the real OGs," i explained.

"but yo, where’s the two?" he pressed.

"i said, there’s a second vibe that’s basically the ear-version of what the eyes do," i explained. "like, just as your eyes are tuned to peep the stars, your ears are meant to catch those harmonious moves. they’re like twin sciences—as the pythagoreans say, and you, glauc-on, are totally with that, right?"

"yup," he replied.

"but here’s the tea: this study is mad grind, so we should bounce and learn from them; they’ll clue us in if there’s any other legit flex in these sciences. meanwhile, let’s not ghost our ultimate higher goal."

"what’s that even?" he asked.

"there’s a perfection that every bit of knowledge should hit, and our squad of learners should level up to it too—no half-steppin’, like what happened in astro. cuz in the harmony game, as you def know, the same drama goes down. the harmony teachers compare sounds and spreads you can only hear, but their hustle—like that of the astro crew—is kinda wasted."

"facts, by the gods!" he exclaimed. "it’s like watching a play when they start dissing their 'condensed notes'—as they call them—hunching their ears up like they’re snooping on a neighbor’s playlist. one squad claims they spot an in-between note and discovered the tiniest spot that should be the standard measure; while others are all like, 'nah, these two sounds are vibing the same,' with each crew putting their ears before their big brain."

"you mean, bro, those dudes who straight-up mess with the strings, tweaking them on the instrument’s pegs? i could keep runnin’ with that metaphor and drop deets on how the plectrum slaps the strings—calling out their lag and hyperdrive in sound—but that’d get old real quick. so imma just say i’m not talking about those clowns; i mean the pythagoreans, whom i was just about to school on harmony. like the astro peeps, they’re off-key—they crunch the numbers in the harmonies they hear but never nail down the real probs. in other words, they never tap into the natural harmony of numbers or break down why some digits vibe together while others don’t."

"that, my dude, is some next-level, beyond-mortal knowledge," he said.

"i’d call it useful, tho—if you’re chasing the vibe of beauty and goodness; but if you’re on a different wavelength, it’s just straight-up useless," i replied.

"big facts," he agreed.

now, when all these studies start linking up and vibing together, and when we peep their mutual connections, then—and only then—will chasing them really pay off for our goals; otherwise, it’s just extra work for zero gains.

"i feel you; but socrates, you’re talking about a mega quest," he said.

"what are you saying? is this just the trailer? don’t you know it’s the preface to the actual main banger we gotta learn? cuz you ain’t gonna call a math genius a dialectician, right?"

"def not," he said. "i barely know any mathematician who can actually drop logical truth."

"but do you seriously think that peeps who can’t throw a reason around will ever have the knowledge we need?" i asked.

"can’t even imagine that," he agreed.

"so, glauc-on," i said, "we’ve finally landed on what i call the hymn of dialectic. this jam is all about the intellect, even though your eyes might try to mimic it. remember, our eyes eventually got to peep real animals, the stars, and finally even the sun. just like with dialectic: when someone starts hunting for the absolute truth using only that pure brain light—no sensory crutches—and grinds until, through sheer intelligence, they hit the absolute good, they eventually reach the finish line of the intellectual realm, like how vision ends at the border of the visible."

"facts," he agreed.

"so this is the glow-up you call dialectic?"

"true," he replied, "no cap."

"but check it: the liberation of the chained homies, the flip from shadow-mode to full-on light and images, the rise from the underground dens to bask in the sun—even as they struggle to peep animals, plants, and the solar drip with their weak eyes, yet can still catch the divine reflections in water (straight-up heavenly), which are just the shadows of true existence (not the lame fire-shadow imitations compared to the sun’s real glow)—this mega power of lifting the soul’s highest vibe to contemplate the absolute best in existence (like leveling up the body’s natural light to catch the brightest drip in the material world) is all thanks to that grind and chase in the arts i just broke down."

"i’m 100% with you on that," he replied. "it may sound wild, but from another angle it’s even harder to deny. look, this isn’t just a side hustle topic—it’s something we gotta loop over again and again. so whether our final vibe ends up true or false, let’s roll with it and bounce right from the preface into the chief jam (yeah, a play on the greek term that means both 'law' and 'strain') and break that down too. lay it on me: what’s the essence and the splits of dialectic, and what trails lead there? ‘cause these trails are also our ticket to final chill."

"dear glauc-on," i said, "you might not catch my full drift right here, even though i’m gonna do my best. you’ll peep more than just an image—you’ll glimpse the absolute truth, at least in my book. whether what i dropped on you is fully reality i can’t even promise; but i’m hella confident you’ll see some legit realness."

"no cap," he replied.

"but gotta remember, only the raw power of dialectic can drop this level of truth—and that’s only for those who are already down with the previous knowledge squads."

"you can bank on that," he said.

"and seriously, no one’s gonna say there’s any other legit method—any regular process—to fully peep true existence or nail what each thing really is at its core. cuz, generally, the arts are all about human cravings and opinions, or they’re hyped for making stuff, building things, or keeping those builds alive; and the math sciences—which we mentioned, like geometry, have a slight boss factor in understanding true being—are just dreamin’ about existence. they never really catch wakeful reality as long as they leave those unexamined hypotheses hanging and can’t even break ‘em down. like, when a dude doesn’t even know his original base vibe, and when both his final take and all his in-between moves are built out of some unknown sauce, how can he think that lame chain of conventions will ever level up into true science?"

"impossible, bro," he said.

"so, dialectic—and only dialectic—goes straight to the original vibe and is the one science that yeets hypotheses to lock its ground down. it’s like the eye of the soul, which is literally sunk in a cray bog, but with its gentle assist it gets lifted right up high. and it squads up all those sciences we been chatting about as its homies in the conversion hustle. sure, folks call ‘em sciences, but they deserve a snazzier label—something that screams more clarity than just plain opinion but not full-on science. in our earlier sketch, we called that 'understanding.' but yo, why even sweat the names when we got heavy realities to peep?"

"why indeed," he said, "when any tag that nails the brain’s vibe clearly is all that matters?"

anyway, we’re cool with splitting things into four zones—two for intellect and two for opinion. we call the first zone science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth just shadow perception. opinion’s all about what’s coming into being, while intellect owns the state of being. so here’s the ratio:

as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as intellect vibes with opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to shadow perception.

but yo, let’s chill on drilling further into splitting up opinion and intellect—they’d take way longer than this chat.

"i get you," he said, "i’m totally with that."

and then i asked, "you also down with calling a dialectician the one who nails the true essence of every single thing? and if someone can’t flex that conception properly, can we say they’re failing on the intelligence front?"

"yes, how could i even front on that?" he replied.

"and you’d say the same goes for the vibe of 'good'? like, until someone can straight-up extract and rationally define what good is, and until they can run every clapback and shoot down objections—not just with opinions, but with straight-up absolute truth, never slipping at any step of the argument—you’d say they don’t even really know what good is; they only peep a weak shadow, something dished out by opinion and not by science. i mean, they’re out here sleepwalking through their life, and by the time they’re fully woke here, they hit the ultimate timeout in the underworld."

"on all that, i’m 100% with you," he said.

"and bet, you wouldn’t let the kiddos of your dream state—the ones you’re raising and schooling, assuming that ideal ever goes viral—slap future rulers who are just static, like basic posts with no reason in them, to run the highest-level deets?"

"def not," he replied.

"so you’d drop a law that they gotta get an education that levels them up to be the ultimate question-asking and answering legends, right?"

"yep, you and i, we’re co-creating that," he said.

so dialectic, as you’re vibing, is like the ultimate crown jewel of the sciences—it sits right on top, no other science can climb any higher. the nature of knowledge can’t get any more lit, right?

"i agree," he said.

"but who we hand these studies to, and how we dish ‘em out, are still big questions we gotta figure out."

"yep, totally," he agreed.

"remember how we picked the rulers before?" i reminded him.

"for sure," he said.

we still gotta choose the same real ones, giving mad props to the most solid and brave, and if possible, the freshest, most aesthetic homies; and with noble and generous vibes, they gotta have those natural boss gifts to make learning a breeze.

"and what gifts are those?" he asked.

"gifts like mad sharp focus and that clutch ability to pick up info super quick; cuz honestly, a brain usually taps out from hardcore study way before it taps out from gym drills. the grind is hella a brain thing, not a bod thing," i explained.

"big facts," he replied.

furthermore, the dude we’re scouting should have a killer memory and be an unwearied, solid bro who vibes with any hustle—otherwise, how’s he gonna survive all the hardcore physical drills and the insane brain grind we demand?

"definitely," he said. "he’s gotta come with those natural gifts."

here’s the lowkey mess right now: peeps studying philosophy ain’t got a true hustle, and that’s why philosophy’s gotten major disses. her true homies should be those who ride with her hand-in-hand, not these fake, off-brand wannabes.

"what u mean?" he asked.

"first off, her diehards shouldn’t be half-assed—i mean, they shouldn’t be half grind and half chill. like, say a dude loves gym, hunting, and all sorts of physical action but straight-up hates the grind of learning, listening, or deep diving into knowledge. or maybe his whole hustle is totally flipped, and he’s lacking in that intellectual hustle."

"for sure," he said.

"and about truth, isn’t a soul considered lame if it hates intentional lies and gets hella heated when someone tosses a fib, yet dangerously chill with accidental BS—like wallowing in ignorance with no shame when caught?"

"facts," he agreed.

"and again, when it comes to temperance, courage, magnificence, and all that other virtue, shouldn’t we peep the true bloodlines from the fakes? cuz if we can’t spot those real vibes, both the state and individuals will end up trippin’, and suddenly the state crowns someone as ruler or friend who’s missing key virtue juice—making them look lame or just a fake."

"that’s mad true," he said.

"so all this stuff is on us to really break down. and if only the peeps we drop into this massive edu system are solid in both bod and brain, then even justice herself won’t have any beef with us, and we’ll be straight-up saviors of the constitution and the state. but if our students are off in another lane, the tables flip and we end up drenching philosophy in even more ridicule than it’s already snaggin’."

"that’d be a total trainwreck," he said.

"def not," i replied, "but maybe by flipping from clownin’ around to serious vibes, i’m just as extra ridiculous."

"how so?" he asked.

"i forgot, i said, that we were just vibin’ and got way too hyped. when i peeped philosophy gettin’ mad dissed and trampled on by fools, i couldn’t help but feel a surge of indignation at the clout-stealers behind her downfall—and man, my anger went full savage mode."

"indeed! i was listening and wasn’t even trippin’ that hard," he said.

"but i, the one spitting this truth, totally felt it. and now lemme remind you that even though in our earlier picks we chose old heads, we can’t roll that way here. solon was straight-up trippin’ when he said old dudes can learn a ton—like, they can’t learn any more than they can sprint; youth is the prime time for that extra hustle."

"of course, fr," he replied.

"and so, math, geometry, and all those other ed vibes that pump you up for dialectic should be served to the brain from childhood; but never in a forced, no-chill edu vibe."

"why not tho?" he asked.

"cuz a free homie shouldn’t be turned into a slave for knowledge. forced physical training is cool for the bod, but forced brain drip? nah, that ain’t gonna lock in."

"mad true," he agreed.

"then, my good friend, i said, ditch the compulsion. let early education be pure amusement; that way you can peep someone’s natural flex better."

"that’s a hella rational vibe," he said.

"remember how the kiddos were supposed to catch a vibe watching battle rides on horseback? and if it’s all safe, they get up close so they can, like, taste a bit of the blood drip like young pups?"

"yep, i remember," he replied.

"same play applies, i said, to every hustle—lessons, workouts, even dangerous vibes—and whoever’s most chill in all of them gets bumped to the elite crew."

"at what age tho?" he asked.

"at the point when the essential gym time is done—like that 2-3 year training period which is basically useless for any other flex; cuz sleep and workouts don’t really mix with deep learning—and the showdown of who’s first in the gym is one of the dopest tests our youth face," i explained.

"definitely," he replied.

"after that, the chosen 20-year-olds get leveled up to higher honor, and all the random sciences they picked up in early chaos merge, letting them peep how everything’s connected and aligned with true being."

"yep, that’s the only kind of knowledge that sticks," he said.

"yes, and that ability to soak up this kind of knowledge is the ultimate flex of dialectical talent—a broad, all-encompassing mind is always the dialectical mind."

"i agree with you," he said.

"so these are the vibes you gotta weigh up; and those who seriously get it, who are the most consistent in their learning, and who slay in military and other key gigs, by the age of thirty should be plucked from the elite crew and leveled up. then, you gotta test them with dialectic to see which one can ditch basic sight and senses altogether, squad up with truth, and hit absolute being. and here, my dude, you gotta be mega cautious."

"why mega caution?" he asked.

"don’t you see how massive the chaos dialectic has stirred up?" i pressed.

"what chaos?" he asked.

"the students of this art are straight-up wildin’ with lawlessness," i said.

"for real," he agreed.

"so, do you think there’s anything so extra, so inexcusable about their vibe? or you gonna let it slide?"

"in what way, let it slide?" he asked.



yo, i want you, i said, on a parallel vibe, to peep this imaginary son raised in crazy baller wealth; he’s from a massive fam and his timeline’s flooded with bootlickers. when he levels up to grown man mode, he finds out that the folks he thought were his ride-or-die crew are actually sus AF fake news – and the legit ones? total mystery, like a secret drop with no clues. so, can u vibe out how he’ll act toward his clout-chasing simp squad and his pseudo fam—first when he’s still oblivious to the epic fraud, and then after the tea’s spilled? or shall i drop the deets for you?

if you please.

i’d say, while he’s still living in oblivion, he’s gonna flex mad respect for his dad, mom, and that so-called fam way more than for all those bootlickers; he won’t ghost or throw shade at them when they need him, and he’ll def not diss them over any big deal.

for sure, he will.

but once he peels back the truth, i’m betting his respect for his fake fam will nosedive, and he’ll go hard for the bootlickers instead; their clout on him will skyrocket, and he’ll start straight-up living by their playbook—chilling with them open and all, and unless his vibe is extraordinarily lit, he won’t stress over those pseudo-parents anymore.

fr fr, that seems mad likely. but how does this tea drop on the philosophy squad?

look, it’s like we were schooled on OG vibes like justice and honor from day one, raised under that parental authority, obeying and honoring those core maxims.

facts.

plus, there’s this other squad of wild maxims and pleasure habits that try to flex on your soul, but they don’t even phase someone who’s on that right-path vibe—we keep it 100 with the values our old-school fam taught us.

true that.

so, when a dude’s in that state, and his inner skeptic starts asking “what’s actually fair or honorable?” and he spouts the legislator’s old-school lines, then a crazy remix of arguments comes at him from every angle, wrecking his vibe until he ends up thinking nothing’s really honorable versus dishonorable, or just versus bad—even all the ideas he used to stan get flipped on him. u think he’ll still ride or die for those values like before?

impossible, fam.

and once he’s over it and no longer sees them as naturally rad, and he can’t even peep what’s true, can we really expect him to chase any life apart from the one that just flatters his own craving for vibes?

he cannot.

and so, from playing the lawkeeper, he straight-up transforms into a lawbreaker?

unquestionably, bet.

so all this is hella natural for philosophy peeps like i described, and like i just dropped, it’s totally excusable.

yea, he said—and honestly, kinda triggering pity.

so, to keep u from getting all mushy over our 30-year-old citizens, we’ve gotta be extra cautious when sliding them into dialectic.

for sure.

there’s a risk they might catch that sweet delight way too early; cuz, as u’ve prolly seen, when newbies first get a taste, they start arguing just for clout, always clapping back and contradicting others like it’s a meme battle—like little puppy-dogs hyped on pulling and tearing at anything that comes near.

yea, no cap, that’s literally their fave move.

and once they rack up mad wins and epic fails, they flip their whole belief system on the spot, so not only do they get all shook, but philosophy itself ends up getting a sus rep everywhere.

too true, fr.

but when a dude levels up in age, he won’t be that extra wild anymore; he’ll start vibing like a proper truth-seeking dialectician instead of a clown eristic just dissing for giggles, and his overall cooler, more balanced character will actually boost the honor of his pursuit.

very true, bet.

and didn’t we lock in that philosophy disciples gotta be on point and ride or die, not just any random wannabe or intruder crashing the party?

facts.

so, suppose i drop that studying philosophy replaces gym class, and we grind on it full send for double the number of years you’d normally sweat it out—u reckon that’s enough?

“you think six or four years?” he asked.

i’m like, “nah, five years,” i replied; and when that timer’s up, they gotta be sent back into the den, forced to snag any military or other gig that a young buck qualifies for—so they grind out real-life xp and get tested on whether, when tempted in all sorts of wild ways, they hold it down or yeet out.

and how long is this whole phase gonna last?

fifteen years, i answered; and once these legends hit fifty, then let those still kicking and who’ve flexed in every move of life and every field of knowledge finally hit their peak: the moment drops when they gotta lift their soul goggles to the universal light that levels up all things, and peep the absolute good. that’s the blueprint for how they’re gonna order the state and drop rules on individual lives for the rest of their days—making philosophy their main hustle, but when it’s their turn, they also grind in politics and rule for the common squad, not like they’re on some epic heroic quest, just doing it out of straight-up duty. and when they’ve raised a posse of mini icons in every generation to keep the state on lock, they’ll yeet off to the islands of the blest to chill forever; and the city will drop public memorials, sacrifices, and mad props on them—if the pythian oracle gives a thumbs up, they get hailed as demigods, otherwise, they’re still forever blessed and divine.

bro, you’re a dope sculptor, socrates, and you’ve carved our governors into statues that are major aesthetic goals.

yep, i said, glaucon, and our queens too; cuz u gotta know, my vibe isn’t just for dudes, but for women as well, all in their true essence.

deadass, he said, since we made them vibe equal in all things, just like the guys.

alright, i said, and u’d agree, right? that everything said about the state and government isn’t just some wishful dream—it’s tough but not impossible, only possible in the way we pictured; that is, when true philosopher kings are born into a state, one or more of them, totally dissing the lame honors of this sus present world they see as trash, holding what’s right and the honor that flows from it as the ultimate flex, and treating justice as the top-tier essential, will rise up as their ministers and exalt these principles when they lay out the city’s order.

so, how they gonna roll?

they’ll kick off by sending out into the countryside every homie from the city over ten years old, scooping up all the kiddos (who haven’t yet caught the shady vibes of their parents) and schooling them on a fresh set of habits and our own solid laws—i mean, the rules we laid down. this way, the state and constitution we’re hyping will hit that happiness level super fast, and the nation rocking that setup will totally come out on top.

facts, that’s the ultimate plan. and i think, socrates, u totally nailed the deets on how such a constitution might ever drop.

alright, that's enough on the perfect state and its vibe mirror—it's hella obvious how we’re gonna paint its homie.

no cap, he replied; and i’m with u that nothing more needs to be spilled.
