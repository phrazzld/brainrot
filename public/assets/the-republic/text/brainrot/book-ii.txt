book ii.

with those words, i figured i’d wrapped up the convo; but real talk, that end was just the kickoff. glaucon, always the most trigger-happy dude, wasn’t down with thrasymachus bouncin’ – he was all, “let’s throw down for real.” so he hit me with, “socrates, you tryna actually school us, or just fakin’ like you convinced us that bein’ just is always better than bein’ crooked?”

i’d really love to school you, i replied, if i could.

then, clearly, you ain’t nailed it. now lemme ask: how would you sort out the goods – aren’t there some things we stan just for their own vibe, independent of any follow-up perks, like harmless pleasures that hit different in the moment even if nothing extra drops later?

i totally vibe with that idea, i replied.

and ain’t there also a second squad of goods – like knowledge, sight, health – that are dope not only on their own but also for the glow-ups they bring?

certainly, i said.

yo, wouldn't you peep a third squad like gym class vibes, sick-care crew, and doc skills; plus all those money-making side hustles—lowkey they do us good but we still think they're kinda sus; nobody's choosing 'em for the pure feels, only 'cause they bring that extra clout or reward, no cap.

yeah, there's a third crew too. but why you askin'?

straight up, i wanna know—in your three-tier menu, where you droppin' justice?

i replied, "it's in the supreme squad—the kind of glow-up a true vibe-seeker wants both for the pure feels and for that epic payoff."

then a bunch of peeps be like, "nah fam, justice is actually in the sus squad—it's all about chasing clout and receipts, but on its own, it's hella meh and best left ghosted."

i know, i said, that's literally their flex, and that was exactly the tea thrasymachus was droppin' just now—roasting justice and hyping up injustice. but real talk, i'm too stupid to get swayed by his cringey drip.

i wish, he said, that you tuned into my vibe as hard as you did his, then we'd see if we’re on the same wavelength. like, thrasymachus got snagged by your voice like a snake mesmerized by sick beats, but honestly, the real lowdown on justice and injustice is still mad foggy for me. ditching all that clout and reward talk, i wanna know what they are deep down and how they work on the soul. if you’re cool, then imma resurrect thrasymachus’s argument. first up, imma spill the tea on the nature and origin of justice as the squad normally sees it; next, i'll flex that every dude who plays justice is doing it on auto-pilot outta necessity—not 'cause it’s inherently lit; and finally, imma hit you with the fact that, if their claim is on point, the shady life is way more fire than being straight-up just—though, socrates, i'm not about that vibe myself. still, i gotta admit, my ears are drowning in thrasymachus and a million other voices, and i've yet to hear anyone convincingly proving that justice trumps injustice on its own. i need to hear justice hyped for the sake of pure justice; then i'll chill, and i know you're the plug who can drop that tea. so imma go full send praising the unjust life, and my flow will show how i wanna see you hype justice and roast injustice. you down with that plan?

i'm totally vibing with it; honestly, i can't think of anything more lit to rap about.

i'm hella hyped to hear that, he replied, so imma kick off by dropping the deets on the nature and roots of justice.

they be sayin' that dishing out injustice is lowkey a win, while catchin' it is hella bad—but the bad vibes always outweigh the good. so when peeps have both served and taken injustice, and can't dodge one or snag the other, they squad up and be like, "nah, let's just skip this game," and boom—laws and mutual deals drop in. whatever gets stamped by law becomes what they call legit and just. this is the tea on justice’s origin—a remix between the dopest move of doing injustice and dodging punishment, and the worst-case of suffering injustice with zero recoil; justice just lands in the middle, not lit as a win, but as the lesser evil, respected only 'cause folks ain't got the juice to be blatantly unjust. cuz real ones, who actually earn their stripes, would never sign up for that lame deal if they could fight it off—they'd be straight trippin'. that's the ancient account, socrates, on how justice came to be.

now, peep this: the real tea on peeps who ride justice is that they do it involuntarily, 'cause they ain't got the power to be shady. to get the full picture, imagine if both the just and the unjust had full-on free reign—let's watch where their cravings take 'em. you'd see that both squads end up chasing what they think is their ultimate win, but only get shoved onto the justice track by the law's hard push. and that freedom? it’d be cranked up if we call it the power that gyges—ancestor of croesus from lydia—was rumored to have. word on the street is, gyges was just a shepherd grindin' for the lydia king; when a mega storm and earthquake cracked the ground where he was chillin' with his flock, my dude slid down and discovered a hollow bronze horse with doors. there, he peeped a dead homie, lookin' larger-than-life and rockin' nothing but a gold ring. he yeeted that ring off the corpse and bounced back up. later, when the shepherd crew gathered to drop their monthly report to the king, gyges strolled in with that ring. while he was kickin' it, he accidentally flipped the ring’s collar inward—boom, he went invisible, and the squad started chattin' like he dipped. he was shook, so he twisted it back outward and reappeared. after a few tests—same drill: inward equals vanish, outward equals visible—he plotted his move, got picked as one of the court's runners, and once there, seduced the queen. with her help, he clapped the king and snatched the whole kingdom. now, picture if there were two magic rings—one on the just crew and one on the shady crew; no dude's got the guts to stick to pure justice if he could flex being shady. honestly, no one would leave cash on the table, or pass up swiping what isn't theirs at the market, or crash any crib for a chill sesh, or even off someone from jail, if they could safely do it, flexing like a god among mortals. then, the moves of the just and the shady would look identical—they’d both end up at the same point. and that's solid proof that no one is just by choice or 'cause they think justice ups their personal game—they only roll with justice 'cause they can't safely be shady. deep down, every soul knows that dodgy moves bring way more wins than being on the level, and anyone vibin' with my theory will agree. imagine someone with that invisibility clout who never does wrong or touches someone else's stash—they’d be seen as a major clown by the watchers, even though they'd get secret props out of fear of catching injustice themselves. enough of that hot mess.

alright, if we wanna seriously judge the just life versus the shady life, we gotta isolate 'em—no mixing allowed. how we do that? here’s the play: let the shady dude be 100% shady, and the just homie be 100% just; nothing gets cut, and both come fully loaded for their own grind. first up, let the shady guy be like a boss-level pro—like a slick pilot or next-level doctor who knows his limits and can bounce back if he slips. so, let him pull off his shady moves the right way and keep it on the DL if he wants to level up in injustice (because if he gets caught, he's done for—nobody's buying that). the ultimate of being shady is when you're falsely tagged as just, even though you're not. so i say, in a truly shady dude, we gotta assume he deploys the peak of injustice; no discounts allowed, but still he scores the highest rep for appearing just while doing the most off moves. if he stumbles, he better be able to recover fast; he’s gotta be smooth on the mic if his moves leak, and use his strength, cash, and squad power to bulldoze through when needed. meanwhile, right next to him, we got the truly just guy—noble and simple, actually wanting to be good instead of just lookin' it—like aeschylus said, to be and not just seem. there should be zero fakin', 'cause if a dude only seems just, he'll rack up honors and rewards, and then we can’t tell if he’s truly just or just chasin' clout; so let him be draped in only genuine justice, with no extra flair; picture him livin' the complete opposite life from the shady one. let him be the best of men, even if the world thinks he's the worst—then his real self gets tested. and let him ride that vibe all the way to the grave, being just inside while appearin' shady outside. when both push to the extremes—the one on justice and the one on injustice—let's drop the final verdict: which one ends up truly happier?

bro, my dear glaucon, i said, how you shinin' these up for the showdown—like you're polishing two statues one after the other.

i do my best, he replied. now that we peep their true profiles, it's easy to map out the life path awaiting each. imma break it down now; but if my description comes off a bit raw, socrates, just roll with it and imagine these words coming straight from the eulogists of injustice: they'll tell you that the just dude who gets tagged as shady ends up getting whipped, tortured, tied up—have his eyes burned out; and then, after catchin' every kind of L, he even gets impaled. then he realizes he should just look the part and not actually be just; aeschylus's lines might actually vibe better for the shady crew than the truly just. cuz the unjust are chasing the real deal—they don’t live for appearance; they wanna be actual shady, not just seem it.

"his mind got that deep, fertile dirt where all his dope brain moves just spring up, no cap."

first off, peeps see him as straight-up just, so he runs the city scene; he can marry whoever he wants and even hook up others, trade and deal wherever, always flipping it to his own advantage 'cause he ain't got no guilt about being shady; in every matchup—public or private—he claps his rivals, cashes in on their losses, stacks that paper, and uses his gains to boost his friends and wreck his enemies. on top of that, he can drop lavish sacrifices and epic gifts to the gods, and honor whoever he pleases way better than the truly just, meaning he's likely even more favored by the gods. so, socrates, it's like gods and mortals team up to make the shady life way more baller than the just life.

i was about to drop some words to glaucon when adeimantus, his bro, jumped in: "socrates, you ain't gonna tell us there's nothing else to add, right?"

i was like, "c'mon, what else is there to yeet?"

he shot back, "yo, you missed the absolute strongest flex of them all."

aight, then, as the old saying goes, "let brother help brother"—if a dude flops anywhere, you gotta back him up; even tho, i gotta admit, glaucon already spilled enough tea to put me on blast and strip me of any clout in boosting justice.

nah, bogus, he replied. but lemme drop some extra tea: there's another angle to glaucon’s whole spiel on praising and trashing justice versus injustice—which you gotta catch to get his drift. basically, our parents and teachers are always on us about staying just; but why? not for the love of justice itself, but for rep and clout—in hopes that if you're known as just, you unlock dope offices, marriages, and all those perks glaucon mentioned that shady folks get from the rep of justice. plus, this crew cares more about the looks than the real deal; they even throw in the gods' blessing and hype up how a shower of benefits rains on the pious—as told by the noble hesiod and homer. hesiod drops lines sayin' that the gods make the oaks of the just "bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle; and the sheep get bowed down by their heavy fleeces," and serves up a load of similar epic blessings. homer’s on the same beat: he hypes up a dude whose rep is "like that of a flawless king who, like a god, keeps it just; to whom the black earth drops wheat and barley, whose trees are loaded with fruit, and his sheep never bail, while the sea hooks him up with fish."

and yo, the heavenly gifts for the just are even next-level—musaeus and his son drop blessings straight into the mortal realm, where saints are chillin' on couches at eternal ragers, always smashed and crowned with garlands; apparently, an everlasting binge is the ultimate badge of virtue. some even say that the squad of the faithful and just will flex their legacy through third and fourth generations. that's the vibe when they hype justice. but when it comes to the wicked, they flip the script: they dump them in a gross slough in hades, making 'em haul water with a broken sieve; plus, while they're still livin', they drag their names through the mud and hit 'em with all the punishments glaucon described for those just dudes who are mistaken as shady—nothing extra in their punishment toolkit. that's how they serve praise for one and throw major shade for the other.

once more, socrates, lemme ask you to peep another angle on justice and injustice—a spin not just from the poets, but also from the straight-up prose voices. the universal voice of mankind keeps shoutin' that justice and virtue are mad respectable but hella heavy and toilsome; meanwhile, the perks of vice and being shady are super accessible, only gettin' clapped for by law and public opinion. they even say that being honest is usually less profitable than dodgy moves; and they're quick to call bad dudes happy, hyping 'em publicly and privately when they're rich or influential, while dissing and ghosting the weak and broke—even though deep down, they know those weakies are better than the rest. but the wildest flex is how they rap about virtue and the gods: they claim the gods dole out mad misery to way too many good peeps, while blessing the shady ones with all the good vibes. then, those hustlin' prophets show up at rich dudes' doors, convincing them that they've been handed divine power to clear a man’s or his ancestors' sins through sacrifices, charms, epic feasts, and ragers; promising to smack an enemy—just for a small fee—using magic and incantations that supposedly bind the heavens to their will. and the poets? they’re the OG authorities who smooth out the path of vice with hesiod’s bars: "vice may be had in abundance without any hassle; the way's smooth and her crib is right nearby. but before virtue, the gods set you on a grind," a tedious uphill hustle. then they drop homer as witness that even the gods can get swayed by mortals; like, he says, "the gods, too, can be turned from their groove; and dudes pray to them, dodging their wrath with sacrifices, chill entreaties, libations, and that bomb aroma of fat when they've totally screwed up."

and then they serve up a whole squad of books by musaeus and orpheus—the so-called kids of the moon and the muses, as they claim—in which they flex their ritual moves and convince not just individuals but entire cities that you can wipe your sin slate clean with sacrifices and dope distractions that fill a free hour, serving both the living and the dead; for the dead, they call it "mysteries," which are supposed to redeem us from hellish pain, but if we ghost 'em, no one even knows what epic L awaits.

he proceeded: "and now, when the youngins catch all this chatter about virtue and vice, and how gods and mortals rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i'm talkin' about the quick-witted crew, buzzing like bees all over every dope flower, scooping up all these takes on what kinda peeps they should be and how they should roll if they wanna live their best life. probably these youth will be like quoting pindar in their head: 'can i, by keepin' it just or by flexin' some crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people be sayin' that if i'm truly just and also seen as just, there's zero profit—instead, you'll only suffer mad pain and losses. but if, while bein' shady, i score the rep of justice, then a heavenly life is on the menu. since philosophers proved that appearances flex harder than truth and rule the happiness game, i gotta ride that look. i'll deck out the front of my crib with a picture-perfect vibe of virtue; and behind the scenes, i'll let a sly, crafty fox shadow my moves—just as archilochus, the dopest of sages, recommends. and sure, i hear some peep yellin' that hidin' your shady deets is mad difficult; to that, i say, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth, we'll set up secret crews and underground political clubs. plus, there are straight-up rhetoric profs teachin' how to sway courts and assemblies; so, mixin' smooth talk with a bit of muscle, i can snag illegal gains and dodge the heat. and yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be fooled or forced. but what if there are no gods—or if they could care less about human drama? then why sweat about stayin' lowkey? and even if the gods are on our side, we only know 'em from legends and poet family trees—the very same folks who claim they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it 100: either we buy it all or we don't. if the poets are droppin' straight facts, then we had better be shady AF and cash in on those unjust gains; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge cosmic revenge, we'll miss out on the sweet wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating between sinning and prayin', the gods get all appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future crew will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the reflection—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with epic power. that's what the major cities be proclaimin', and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same truth.

. . .

so then he went on, "and now when the young bloods get all this talk on virtue and vice, and how gods and peeps rate 'em, how's that gonna twist their brains, my dear socrates? i mean, the sharp ones—buzzin' like bees across every dope flower and snatching up conclusions about how they should roll—might be like, in the words of pindar, 'can i, by bein' just or by pullin' off crooked hustle, climb up to a fire fortress that lasts all my days?'"

cuz people say if i'm actually just and also seen as just, then there’s zero profit—and you'll only rack up pain and loss. but if, while bein' shady, i secure the rep of justice, then a heavenly life gets promised to me. since philosophers proved that appearances straight-up rule over truth and happiness, i gotta devote myself to that vibe. i'll set up a dope picture of virtue as the entrance and face of my crib; and behind it, i'll let the subtle, crafty fox of deception trail my moves, just like archilochus—the dopest sage—recommended. sure, i hear someone shout that hidin' your shady side is mad tough; to that, i hit back, "nothing epic comes easy." still, the whole argument points out that if we wanna be happy, that's the road we gotta roll on. for stealth mode, we'll form secret brotherhoods and underground political clubs. plus, there are rhetoric professors droppin' lessons on persuading courts and assemblies; so, partly with slick talk and partly with muscle, i can snag illegal gains and avoid the heat. yet, i still catch voices sayin' that the gods can’t be tricked or forced. but what if there are no gods? or, if they literally don't give a damn about human biz—why should we even sweat the stealth? and even if the gods are out there, we only know 'em from legends and poet fam trees—and those same poets drop that they can be swayed by "sacrifices, chill entreaties, and bomb offerings." so let's keep it real: either we buy into it all or we don't. if the poets are spittin' truth, then we had better go full shady and bank on the gains of injustice; cuz if we're just, even if we dodge heaven's vengeance, we lose out on the unlawful wins; but if we're shady, we keep the loot, and by alternating sinning and prayin'—sinning and prayin'—the gods get appeased and we never get clapped. "but there’s a below-world where either we or our future squad will catch an L for our shady moves." yeah, my friend, that's the takeaway—but there are mysteries and atoning deities with major clout. that's the word from the big leagues, and the offspring of the gods—our poets and prophets—drop the same testimony.

on what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice? like, if we just squad up the worst injustice with some extra shady flex on appearances, then both the gods and the homies in life and in the afterlife are totally vibing with that, as the most extra and highest authorities be preaching. now, socrates, with all that cosmic tea in play, how in the world is any dude with extra smarts, clout, rank, or stacks ever gonna be down to honor justice—or even chill enough not to crack up when justice gets hyped? and even if some genius comes around to drop the truth bomb that justice is the real mvp, he still ain’t throwing fits at the baddie crew; he’s hella down to forgive ’em, ‘cause he knows straight up that peeps don’t just pick justice by free will—unless, of course, some inner divine flex inspires a savage hate for injustice or he unlocks the secret sauce of truth (and no other normie can claim that). honestly, only the weak sauce who, thanks to being a total wuss, old, or just low on clout, can’t even flex being unjust will end up roasting injustice; and, no cap, as soon as that weak sauce gets the power, he goes full-on unjust mode, doing the maximum diss.

yo, the root of all this, socrates, was already dropped at the start of our chat, when my bro and i were like, “we were shook that among all the justice squad—right from the ancient hero legends (whose drip has been preserved for us) to the modern-day peeps—not one of these justice clout preachers ever dissed injustice or hyped justice except to flex the glories, honors, and epic perks that come with them.” no one has ever seriously laid down in verse or prose the true core vibe of either justice or injustice chillin’ in the soul, hidden from the mortal or the divine eye; or shown that, out of all the swag in a man’s soul, justice is the ultimate boss buff and injustice the sickest debuff. if that lit vibe had been the universal track, if y’all had been schooling us on that since back in the day, none of us would’ve been out here on guard trying to stop each other from going off—instead, every dude would’ve been his own bouncer, scared that a wrong move would load him up with the deadliest virus. i’d bet that thrasymachus and the rest would be lowkey saying that the words i’m droppin’—or even harsher ones—about justice and injustice are, in my honest flex, totally twisting their true nature. but i’m spitting this heat in all that passionate fashion, gotta be real with y’all, ‘cause i wanna hear your flip side; and i need you to show not only that justice slaps way harder than injustice, but also break down what kind of glow-up they give to whoever holds ‘em—making one a straight-up good boi and the other a total villain, whether the gods and the homies can peep it or not.

i always had mad respect for the genius of glaucón and adeimantus, but when these words dropped, i was hella hyped and was like, “sons of an illustrious father, that was a chill kickoff to the elegiac verses our biggest fan dropped for you after you absolutely clapped at the battle of megara:— ‘sons of ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’” that title is bang on, ‘cause there’s something totally divine about debating the superiority of injustice while still being unconvinced by your own drip. and i seriously feel that y’all ain’t even vibing with your own argument—i can peep that just from your overall aura, ‘cause if i was only judging by your soundbites, i’d be throwing major shade. but now, the more i trust your genius vibes, the tougher it is for me to pick the right words. i’m caught between two modes; on one side, i feel like i’m not cut out for this epic flex, and on the other, i’m low on clout ‘cause you weren’t down with the answer i threw at thrasymachus proving that justice is the ultimate upgrade over injustice. yet, i can’t just ghost the convo while i still got breath and words to drop; i fear it’d be a straight-up sin to sit back and let justice get clapped without throwing down a defense. so, i gotta step up and drop whatever fire i got.

glaucón and the rest were all up in my dms begging me not to let the deep dive drop, but to keep probing the truth about justice and injustice and their relative wins. i told them straight up that this quest is gonna be a heavy-duty ride, and it’s gonna need some next-level vision to nail it. so, i was like, “since we’re not exactly the einsteins of the century, we should roll with a hack: imagine a peep with super bad eyesight is asked to read tiny text from afar; then someone is like, ‘yo, maybe these words are over here where they’re bigger’—if it’s the same text and he can read the big letters first and then the small ones, that’d be a rare lucky flex.”

“very true,” said adeimantus; “but how does that vibe drop into our inquiry?”

“i’ll break it down,” i replied; “justice, the main tea of our quest, is sometimes dropped as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the overall vibe of a state.”

“true,” he replied.

“and a state is def bigger than a single homie, right?”

“it is.”

“then in the bigger picture, justice is likely more massive and easier to peep. i propose we scope out the nature of justice and injustice first as they roll in the state, and then zoom in on the individual—going from big to small and comparing the vibes.”

“bet, that’s a killer plan.”

“and if we picture the state while it’s still in beta, we’re gonna see justice and injustice emerging along with it.”

“i dare say so.”

“and once the state hits its full release, maybe the cheat-code to our search will drop even easier.”

“yes, far more easily.”

“but yo, should we even try building one? honestly, to construct one is a mega serious flex. think on that.”

“i’ve been thinking, and i’m hyped for you to keep it rolling,” adeimantus said.

so i said, “a state pops off, in my view, from the wild needs of mankind; no one’s riding solo, ‘cause we all got mad wants. can you even imagine any other OG origin for a state?”

“there’s literally no other way.”

“then, since we all got a bunch of needs and a crew is needed to cover ‘em, you grab a helper for one vibe and another for a different one; and when you gather all these partners in one crib, boom—that’s a state.”

“true,” he said.

“and they’re swapping with each other—one drops his goods and the other picks ‘em up—thinking the trade’s gonna be a win-win, a straight flex for everyone.”

“very true.”

“so, let’s start by building a mental state; but remember, the true creator here is necessity, the original mom of our hustle.”

“of course,” he replied.

“now, the numero uno and biggest need is food—the fuel for life.”

“definitely.”

“next up is a crib, and then fresh threads and all that.”

“true.”

“and now, let’s see how our city can handle this major demand: suppose one dude’s a farmer, another’s a builder, someone else slays as a weaver—should we throw in a shoemaker, or maybe another peep to cover our bodily needs?”

“exactly right.”

“in the most basic blueprint of a state, you gotta have like four or five peeps.”

“for real.”

“and how they grind? will each homie drop the fruits of his hustle into a common stash—like the farmer producing extra for the squad, hustling four times as hard to feed not just himself but everyone; or will he ghost collaborating and only handle his own chunk of the feed in a fraction of the time, then spend the rest of his grind building a crib, a coat, or kicks—doing his own thing without teaming up, just handling his own biz?”

adeimantus was like, “i think it’s better if he just focuses on farming instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.”

“probably,” i replied, “that’s the smarter play; and hearing that reminds me that we’re all built diff—our natures are prepped for different hustles.”

“very true.”

“and yo, isn’t a task way more on point when a homie sticks to one gig rather than juggling a whole buffet of work?”

“when he’s on one, it’s def better.”

“plus, no cap, a job is straight-up doomed if it ain’t done at the right moment.”

“no doubt.”

“business isn’t waiting for the homie to chill; he’s gotta lock in his hustle and make it his top priority.”

“facts.”

“so, if that’s the case, then everything gets produced more smoothly, in bulk, and with better quality when a dude just does the one thing he’s naturally built for at the perfect time and leaves the rest alone.”

“undoubtedly.”

“hence, we need more than four citizens; ’cause the farmer ain’t gonna whip up his own plow or mattock if he wants them to perform, and the builder won’t craft his own tools—he’s gonna need a squad; same goes for the weaver and the shoemaker.”

“true.”

“so then carpenters, smiths, and a whole bunch of other artisans will be part of our little state that’s already starting to grow?”

“true.”

“and even if we add herdsmen, shepherds, and other animal handlers—so our farmer squad can cop oxen for plowing, and builders and farmers can get draft cattle, while curriers and weavers score fleeces and hides—our state is still gonna be pretty modest.”

“that’s true; but it won’t be super tiny either as long as all these peeps are in the mix.”

“then, again, there’s the sitch of the city—finding a spot where nothing needs to be imported is basically impossible.”

“impossible.”

“so there must be another class of citizens who roll in with the goods from another city, right?”

“there has to be.”

“if a trader rolls up empty-handed with nothing for the peeps who need him, he’s just gonna bounce back with nada.”

“that’s for sure.”

“so what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but also so epic in both quantity and quality that it hooks up those who bring in the missing vibes.”

“very true.”

“then more farmers and more artisans will be needed?”

“they will.”

“not to mention the importers and exporters, aka the merchants?”

“yes.”

“then we’re gonna need merchants?”

“we are.”

“and if merchandise has to be carried over the sea, mad skilled sailors are gonna be needed in huge numbers?”

“yes, in huge numbers.”

“then, back in the city, how do they swap their drip? setting up that exchange was, as you remember, one of our main moves when we squad’d up and formed a state.”

“clearly, they’re gonna be buying and selling.”

“so they’re gonna need a marketplace, plus some coin—a money-token—for smooth exchanges.”

“definitely.”

“imagine now if a farmer or artisan brings his goods to market and shows up when there’s nobody around to trade—does he just dip and chill, leaving his hustle behind?”

“not at all; he’ll find peeps there who, spotting the gap, step in as the official sales crew. in well-run states, these are usually the ones who aren’t exactly jacked up—low on muscle and thus not too useful for heavy lifting—so their only gig is to chill in the market, swapping cash for goods with sellers and grabbing coin from buyers.”

“this need creates a class of retail traders in our state. isn’t ‘retailer’ the term for those holding down the market spot, while the roaming squad between cities get dubbed merchants?”

“yes, exactly.”

“and then there’s another crew of workers who might not be brainiacs but are jacked enough for heavy labor—they sell their strength and are called, if i’m not tripping, hirelings (with ‘hire’ being the tag on the price of their grind).”

“true.”

“so hirelings help bulk up our population?”

“yes.”

“and now, adeimantus, is our state all leveled up and perfect?”

“i think so.”

“then, where’s justice and where’s injustice, and in which corner of the state did they drop in?”

“i’d say they pop off in the way these citizens interact with each other. i can’t see them cropping up anywhere else.”

“i dare say you’re onto something,” i said; “we’d better really think this through and not shy away from the inquiry.”

“let’s then peep their way of life now that our state is on lock. won’t they be growing corn, brewing wine, sewing threads, cobbling shoes, and building cribs for themselves? and once they’re housed, they’ll be grinding all summer—usually stripped down and barefoot—but in winter, they’re gonna be decked out with full gear and kicks. they’ll chow down on grub like barley-meal and wheat dough, baking and kneading them into noble cakes and loaves; served up on reed mats or clean leaves while they chill on beds dotted with yew or myrtle vibes. then, they and their kiddos will go all out feasting—sipping the wine they brewed, rocking garlands on their dome, and hyping the gods in a lit hangout session. plus, they’ll keep it real by making sure their fam stays within budget, always watchful of poverty or the threat of war.”

“but,” interjected glaucón, “hold up—you didn’t add any extra flavor or relish to their meal, did you?”

“true,” i replied, “i totally spaced that—of course they gotta have a killer relish: salt, olives, and cheese, with roots and herbs boiled up just like the country peeps do; for dessert, we’ll dish out figs, peas, and beans; and they’ll roast myrtle berries and acorns over the fire, sipping moderately. with a menu like that, they’re set to live in peace and health for ages and pass down that vibe to their kiddos.”

“yes, socrates,” he said, “and if you were feeding a city of pigs, how else would you keep the beasts fed?”

“but what would you have, glaucón?” i replied.

“dude, you gotta hook them up with the everyday luxuries—soft sofas to chill on, fancy tables to dine off, and modern sauces and sweets to keep it lit.”

“yeah,” i said, “now i catch your drift: you want me to explore not just the basics of a state but also how to build a deluxe, luxury state; and honestly, no harm in that, ‘cause in a deluxe state we might see how justice and injustice really pop off. in my opinion, the true and healthy constitution of a state is the one i just laid out—but if you’re also about that extra hype, i’m down. i suspect plenty of peeps won’t settle for the simple life. they’ll be about adding sofas, tables, and a whole lot of extra flair; along with gourmet treats, dainties, perfumes, incense, courtesans, cakes in every flavor—not just one kind, but mad varieties. we’d be pushing past the basic needs of cribs, threads, and kicks: the arts like painting and embroidery would have to get in on the hustle, and gold, ivory, and pretty much every kind of bling would need to be snatched up.”

“true,” he said.

“then we gotta expand our borders, ‘cause the OG healthy state just won’t cut it. now the city will have to swell with a massive crew of extra gigs that aren’t needed for the bare necessities—like an entire tribe of hunters and performers (one squad handling visuals and colors, another squad dropping beats and rhymes with poets, players, dancers, and managers), plus makers of all kinds of goods (even women’s dresses). and we’ll need even more assistants. won’t there be a serious need for tutors, nurses (both wet and dry), tirewomen, barbers, bakers, and cooks; and even pig herders, who weren’t on the roster before but are now totally in demand? they can’t be forgotten—and if peeps are munching on animals, a bunch of other critters will be needed too.”

“definitely.”

“and living all this luxe, we’re gonna need way more physicians than before, right?”

“way more.”

“plus, the land that used to support the original crew will be way too cramped now.”

“totally true.”

“then we’ll have to snag a slice of our neighbors’ land for extra pasture and farming, and they might end up wanting a slice of ours too if, like us, they overdo the flex and chase endless wealth.”

“that, socrates, is inevitable.”

“and so, glaucón, looks like we’re heading to war, huh?”

“most certainly,” he replied.

“then, without even deciding whether war is a win or a fail, one thing’s for sure: war comes from the same wild causes that brew nearly every evil in both private and public states.”

“undoubtedly.”

“and our state must expand again—and this time, the upgrade is straight-up an army that has to roll out and battle invaders for every bit of what we got, as well as for the peeps and goods we just broke down.”

“why though?” he asked; “aren’t they strong enough to defend themselves?”

“no,” i said, “not if we stick with that principle we all peeped when we built the state: one dude just can’t nail a bunch of arts at once.”

“very true,” he replied.

“but like, isn’t war an art in itself?”

“definitely.”

“and an art that needs as much focus as, say, shoemaking?”

“definitely, no cap.”

and yo, our squad straight up banned the shoemaker from doing extra gigs like farming, weaving, or building—cuz we needed those kicks on fleek, no cap; each homie got one designated grind that just vibes with their natural drip, and they had to stick to that hustle for life, fr only that gig. no one’s allowed to ghost their chance to level up, else their work game stays lame. honestly, nothing is a bigger flex than soldiers nailing their battle hustle.

but like, can you really think war is such a chill skill to pick up that a dude can be a warrior while also doing farming, shoemaking, or any other artisanal hustle? cuz ngl, no one’s ever been lit at dice or checkers if they just dabble for fun without grinding hardcore from day one. no fancy gear can turn you into a boss workman or defense master if you never put in the hours learning the moves. so how in this meme-filled kingdom is some dude gonna grab a shield or any war gadget and go full fighter in a single day, whether he’s squad-dealin’ heavy fire or rocking any other troop flex?

yeah, he dropped that those epic tools teaching peeps how to use their own gear are straight up priceless, no cap.

and i was like, yo, the bigger the guardian job gets, the more major hours, sick skills, savage art, and hustle are gonna be required, right?

no doubt, fam, he snapped back.

and don't forget, he gotta be born with that clutch vibe for the hustle, right?

straight up, no cap.

so basically, it's on us to flex our selection game and scoop up those natty types who are a perfect match for guarding the city’s crib, bet?

for real, it will.

and i was like, yo, picking these guardians ain’t a walk in the park, but we gotta be bold and put in all our savage effort.

bet, we absolutely must.

aren't the noble youngins just like a snatched, well-bred pupper when it comes to guarding and peeping?

what's that even vibe though?

i mean, both gotta be super on point with their vision, hella fast in catching enemy lurkers, and straight up buff enough to throw down when it's go time.

all those dope traits, he iced, are an absolute must for the guardian squad.

and i mean, your guardian gotta have guts if they're gonna wreck it in battle, right?

100%, definitely.

and honestly, can a dude be brave with zero spunk, whether he's riding a hooptie, flexing like a pupper, or reppin' any beast? seriously, have you not peeped how pure spirit is untouchable and boss-level, making any soul totally fearless and unbreakable?

i mean, i've def caught that vibe.

so basically, we now got a vibe-check on the physical glow-up needed for a guardian.

facts.

and don’t sleep on the brain game too; his soul gotta be lit with spirit, eh?

hell yeah.

but yo, aren’t these extra spirited peeps prone to throw shade and go savage on each other and everyone else, fr?

he admitted that's a major diff obstacle to squash, no cap.

but i was like, they gotta be absolute beasts to their haters and total softies for their squad; otherwise, they’re gonna be self-sabotaging, crashing their own vibe before their enemies even get a chance.

facts, he clapped.

so what’s the move then? i asked—how the heck do we scoop a mellow vibe that still packs that insane spirit, cuz those two seem like total opposites?

true that.

i mean, a guardian missing either vibe is straight weak; but combining both seems like an impossible meme hack—so one might think that leveling up as a top-tier guardian is, like, a total myth.

fr, he admitted, "i’m lowkey scared that you’re absolutely right."

feeling hella confused, i started to re-evaluate the whole convo. "my dude," i said, "no surprise we’re in a total state of confusion—cuz we kinda lost the original vibe we started with, ya feel?"

he was like, "what you even mean, bro?"

i meant to drop that real talk: there are peeps out there pre-gifted with that wild combo vibe.

and like, where do we scoop these legend-status natures, huh?

i fired back, "check it: plenty of animals show us how it’s done. take the dog, for example—these high-key well-bred pups are super chill with their fam and squad, but go savage on strangers."

dude, i know that, fr.

so basically, finding a guardian with that combo is totally valid and natural, right?

for sure, not impossible.

and hold up—a guardian, besides being lit with spirit, should also come with mad philosopher vibes, right?

i’m not really catchin’ your drift, bro.

i clarified, "bro, that trait is also something you peep in dogs, and it’s straight iconic in how they roll."

which trait though?

like, yo, ever notice how a dog gets all heated when a stranger shows up but gives mad love when its homie drops by—even if the stranger never did anything shady and the buddy never did any good? pretty wild, right?

i never really peeped that before, but i gotta admit, your point’s pretty spot on.

and like, that doggy instinct is hella charming—your pupper is basically a lowkey philosopher, no lie.

why’s that, though?

cuz, see, the dog basically peels faces based solely on whether it vibes with you or not. shouldn't every creature be all about that learning life, deciding its faves based on what's known versus what's unknown?

oh for sure, 100%.

and like, isn't lovin' to learn basically lovin' wisdom, aka philosophy?

they're basically on the same vibe, he clapped.

so, can we not, with full drip, say that a dude who’s chill with his squad is naturally a wisdom and knowledge aficionado?

facts—you can bet on that.

so that means a legit epic and noble city guardian’s gotta combo that dope mix of philosophy, spirit, mad speed, and beast strength, right?

no cap—undoubtedly.

so, we've scoped out our ideal peeps; but now that we found them, how do we vibe up their education and rearing? isn't this like a major deets drop on the ultimate quest—how do justice and injustice level up in states? cuz we ain't tryna miss any lit points or drag this convo into endless scroll.

adeimantus was like, "this question is gonna be a major glow-up for our game, trust."

so i told him, my dude, we can’t just yeet this task—even if it’s a mega long haul.

100%, definitely not.

so let’s kick back, chill for an hour droppin' epic stories, and let our tale be the ultimate schooling for our future legends.

yasss, let’s get it.

so like, what’s the education recipe? can we vibe with anything better than the classic drip? cuz it splits into two major tracks: gym class for that body glow-up and music—like tunes for the soul.

facts, true that.

shall we kick off with some sweet beats and then hit the gym for that body flex?

hella yes.

and when you say music, you vibin' on lit too or nah?

i mean, totally.

and literature can be either vibe-true or totally fake?

yeah, for real.

and the kiddos gotta get schooled in both, but do we kick off with the faux tales?

he was like, "i ain't catchin' your drift here, bro."

i was like, "listen up, we start by droppin' stories for kids that might have some truth tea but are mostly made-up, and we serve these up while they're too young to hit gym class hard."

facts, totally on point.

that was my vibe when i said we gotta school 'em on music vibes before all that heavy gym hype.

he was like, "yeah, straight facts."

you also know the start of any project is the ultimate key drop—especially for young, tender things; that's when the squad’s character gets built and that epic impression lands way easier.

no doubt, facts.

and are we really gonna let kids soak up any random, throwaway stories cooked up by random peeps, planting ideas that are like total opposites of what we want their adult vibes to be?

nah fam, we cannot.

so, step one is to set up a lit censorship system for fiction writers, where the censors only let the dope stories fly and yeet the wack ones; and we gotta have moms and caretakers only sharing the approved recaps with the kiddos. let them shape their minds with those epic vibes, even more intensely than they flex on their bodies—but honestly, most of today's tales gotta bounce.

he asked, "which tales you even talkin' about, bro?"

i was like, "yo, the lesser tales reflect the big ones—they both come from the same vibe and share that same spirit, no cap."

he was like, "for sure, but i’m still lowkey confused on what you call the big ones exactly."

i said, "those are the legends spun by homer, hesiod, and the other og poets who've been mankind’s ultimate storytellers since day one."

he was like, "but which stories are you on about, and what's the big tea on their flaws?"

i dropped, "the mega diff is that they be spitting straight lies, and not just any lies—they're servin' up some seriously toxic bs."

but like, when does this epic fail occur?

basically whenever they flex a sketch of gods and heroes that’s totally off—like an artist drawing a portrait with zero vibe of the original masterpiece.

he was like, "yeah, that kind of vibe is totally trash; but which stories you even mean, bro?"

i started, "first off, there's that mega lie straight out of the high towers, where the poet dished on uranus—yeah, hesiod’s wild story about what uranus did and how cronus was like, 'bet, i'm gonna clock you.' even if cronus’s drama and his son’s savage payback were lowkey true, they shouldn’t be casually served up to young, clueless peeps; ideally, just keep that tea locked down. but if you absolutely gotta drop that mystery drop, only a chosen few should peep it, and they gotta sacrifice not some basic eleusinian pig, but like, a massive, legendary, un-findable beast—so only the real ones get in on the secret tea."

he was like, "yeah, no cap, those stories are straight-up massive cringe."

i was like, "amen, adeimantus—they're tales that should never drop in our state; our dudes shouldn't get the message that doing the worst crimes is like, no big deal, or that callin' out your old man on bein' wack is just mimicry of the og god moves."

he straight-up agreed, "i'm totally with you—those stories are not even on the menu for retweetin'."

and also, if we want our future guardians to see internal beef as totally trash, we shouldn't be droppin' any tea about celestial wars or gods schemin', cuz that's all bogus. nah, we ain't ever gonna drop battle recaps of giants or stitch those sagas on their drip; we gotta stay muted on endless godly feuds among buddies and fam. if they’d just vibe with us, we'd say, "yo, squabblin' is unholy," and that there’s literally never been any beef among citizens. that’s the vibe our OGs—old heads—should first school the kiddos on, and later, poets gotta write in that same tone. but those wild stories about hephaestus strappin' his mom down, or the time zeus yeeted him for defending her, and all those god wars in homer—nah, those tales are outright banned in our state, whether they’re deep allegories or not. cuz a young brain can’t even tell what’s metaphor and what’s literal; whatever they soak up at that age sticks like a permanent meme watermark. so it's crucial the first stories they hear are pure, epic role models of virtue.

he was like, "facts, but if any cat asks, 'where do we peep these ideal models and which tales are you spillin'?' how do we even answer that?"

i said, "bro, you and i right now aren’t just poets—we’re the og founders of this state. founders need to know the blueprint of how poets should flex their stories and the boundaries that gotta be maintained, but creatin' the stories isn’t on us."

he was like, "facts, but what exactly are these theology forms you’re on about?"

i replied, "think of it like this—god should always be dropped as he really is, no matter if it’s in an epic, lyric, or tragic style."

right on.

and like, isn’t he the ultimate good boi? shouldn’t he always be shown as such?

absolutely.

and literally, no good thing ever hurts, right?

nope, for real.

and what ain’t hurt, stays harmless, no cap?

definitely not.

and if it doesn’t hurt, it ain’t evil, yeah?

nah.

and can something that’s all good be the reason for evil, fam?

impossible, straight up.

and the good stuff is totally a major plus, right?

100%, yes.

so it’s like, the secret sauce for all that well-being?

yep.

so basically, the good only drops good vibes—it’s not behind every single thing, just the top-tier goods, right?

word, assuredly.

so like, if god is truly good, then he ain’t behind every lil’ thing like everyone says—he’s only the mastermind for the really dope stuff, not most of what hits humanity. c’mon, there’s only a couple of lit perks in human life and tons of burns, so the good vibes come solely from god, while the evils get their receipts from somewhere else, not him.

he was like, "that’s fact, most true that is."

then we can’t vibe with homer or any other poet who goes full cringe by spitting lines like:

  "lie at the threshold of zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots,"

and that if zeus mixes them,

  "sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;"

but if you get the cup of pure bad juju,

  "him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth."

and again—

  "zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us."

and if some fool claims that breakin' oaths and treaties—which was really pandarus’s move—was actually sparked by athene and zeus, or that all that godly drama was kicked off by themis and zeus, then zero respect, my dude; plus, we ain’t lettin’ our young bros catch aeschylus say, "god plants guilt among men when he’s dead set on wreckin' a house." and if a poet starts dishing on niobe’s sufferin’—from that tragic iambic drop—or on the house of pelops, or on the trojan war, or any similar theme, we either don’t let him claim these are god’s works, or if they are, he’s gotta spin a legit explanation that vibes with our search for truth; he must say god did what was righteous and it only made things more epic by droppin' punishment—but then admit that the punished are straight-up miserable and that god can’t be credited with causin' their misery. the poet is totally blocked from sayin' otherwise; sure, he can note that the wicked get their l's cuz they deserve punishment and might even benefit from that divine hammer drop, but sayin' that god, bein' all good, is behind evil for anyone is a major no-go, and that kind of fake news is suicidal, ruinous, and hella impious.

he was like, "i totally agree, i'm down to sign off on that law."

so let this be one of our core rules when it comes to the gods, fam—our poets and reciters gotta stick to the vibe that god ain't the creator of everything, just the source of pure good.

he was like, "that’s dope, that works."

and what about a second rule? can i ask, do you think god is like a mad magician who pulls shape-shifts outta nowhere—showing up in all kinds of forms, sometimes trickin' us with these epic transformations; or is he one and done, locked into his forever epic original form?

he was like, "bro, i need a sec to vibe on that before i drop an answer."

i replied, "look, if anything's gonna change, it’s either the thing doing its own glow-up or some external force messin' with it, ya feel?"

most definitely, no cap.

and like, stuff vibin' at its peak is the least likely to get wrecked; like, when a human’s at their healthiest and strongest, they ain’t easily messed up by food or drinks, and a plant in full blossom barely gets shook by winds or savage sun heat—that’s just facts, fam.

of course.

and wouldn’t the bravest, wisest soul be totally unbothered by any external bs?

totally true.

and i’m guessing the same rule goes for all composite stuff—furniture, houses, clothes: if they’re on point quality, they basically don’t get wrecked by time or life’s curveballs.

very true, no cap.

so basically, any good thing—whether crafted by artsy hands or natural vibes, or both—is the least likely to be messed up by external forces?

true.

but fr, god and all his divine creations are, like, perfect in every way, right?

of course they are, straight up.

so god can hardly be pushed by any outside bs to flip into different shapes?

he’s not gonna, no way.

but could he, like, decide to glow up or transform himself at all?

clearly, he was like, "if change happens at all, it can only be a self-initiated glow-up."

and if he does switch it up, will it be a major upgrade for beauty or just a downgrade into a rougher look?

if god ever changes, it’d only drop his level—because we can’t honestly think he’s ever been lacking in virtue or that epic beauty, right?

very true, adeimantus; but really, who in their right mind—god or mortal—would wanna downgrade and make themselves worse?

impossible, bro.

so it’s like, god will literally never be down to change, cuz he’s supposed to be the ultimate, most flawless version possible—like every god stays 100% locked in their own epic form forever, no cap.

that straight-up follows logically, he said, in my judgment.

then i said, "my dear friend, no poet should ever be allowed to flex that the gods, sneakin' around in weird stranger disguises, strut through cities in all sorts of random forms;" and no one is gonna trash proteus or thetis, nor should any poet—whether in tragedy or any other vibe—drop lines like someone in priestess cosplay beggin' for alms, sayin', "for the life-givin' daughters of inachus of the argos river;" like, we’re not about that fake hype. also, we can’t let moms influenced by these poets scare their kids with messed-up myth versions—spoutin' that certain gods "roll around at night in random stranger looks and in all kinds of forms;" cuz that only turns our kiddos into scaredy-cats while dissin' the gods.

he was like, "heaven forbid, bro."

but even though gods are totally unchangeable, could it be that through some witchcraft or straight-up deception they trick us into thinkin' they're switchin' forms?

maybe, he replied.

but can you really imagine that god would ever be down to lie, either in words or actions, or even send a phony ghost of himself around?

he was like, "i can’t really say, i’m not feelin' that vibe."

i said, "don't you know that the true lie—if we can even drop that term—is despised by both gods and humans alike?"

he was like, "what you mean by that, bro?"

i meant that no one wants to get their core, real self or their highest truths messed with by a lie; that's the one thing they fear infiltrating their whole being.

still, he said, "i just don’t get what you're on about, bro."

i explained, "look, you're readin' super deep into my words, but i'm just sayin' that deception—being duped about the highest truths in your inner self, your soul, and letting a lie stick there—is what people are most majorly not about; they straight up hate it, like, hardcore."

there’s literally nothing more cringey to them.

and like, as i was sayin', that deep ignorance in someone’s soul once they've been duped is what i'd call the real lie; cuz a lie in words is just a lame imitation—a shadow of a past soulful vibe, not pure, unfiltered falsehood. right?

exactly right.

so the true lie gets downright despised by both gods and dudes, right?

yes.

meanwhile, a lie in words can actually be super useful and not all bad; like when you're dealin' with haters—or when your so-called friends go off in a fit of wild madness and are about to do some harm—then that lie can serve as, like, a remedy or a preemptive fix. also, in those myth vibes we were chattin' about—since the real tea on ancient times is lowkey a mystery, we mash up falsehoods to look as real as possible and turn that to our advantage.

he said, "that's mad true."



but can any of these reasons even apply to god? like, are we supposed to think he’s so clueless about the ancient vibes that he ends up straight-up inventing stuff, no cap?

bruh, that would be totally absurd, he said.

so then, does that mean the lying poet has no spot in our god squad?

i’d say nah.

or maybe he drops a lie just ‘cause he’s shook by haters?

that is totally unthinkable.

but what if he’s rolling with friends who are, like, totally cray or extra?

no way—no mad or senseless person can be down as a friend of god.

so there’s literally zero reason for god to cap?

none whatsoever.

so does that mean our superhuman, divine bae is absolutely incapable of any fake energy?

yaaaass.

so god is, like, perfectly simple and 100% real in word and deed; he never switches up, never yeets anyone with fake vibes—neither by sign nor word, by dream or fully woke vision.

“your thoughts,” he said, “reflect mine.”

you’re on the same page then, i said, that this is the second style in which we should spill the tea about divine things. the gods aren’t no magic chameleons who flip modes on us, nor do they ever ghost humanity with deception.

i vibe with that.

then, even though we stan homer, we’re not here for that lying dream that zeus dished out to agamemnon; and we sure ain’t gonna hype up the verses from aeschylus where thetis claims that apollo at her nuptials

  ‘was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long, and to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. and i thought that the word of phoebus, being divine and full of prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has slain my son.’

these kinds of vibes about the gods are pure trigger material; whoever drops them gets benched from the chorus, and we won’t let teachers use that trash to school the young—‘cause our guardians, as human as they get, need to be 100% real worshippers of the gods, on their level.

i’m totally down with that, he said, and promised to lock it in as his own law.
