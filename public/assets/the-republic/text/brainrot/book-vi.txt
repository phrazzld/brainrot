book vi.

and so, glaucon, after this marathon debate rolled on for what felt like forever, the real ones—and the fakes—of philosophy have finally dropped into the feed.

i don’t think, he said, that we could’ve cut this convo any shorter.

i guess not, i said; but i still feel we could've scoped out both crews better if we’d just stuck to this one topic and not been sidetracked by a gazillion other questions. anyone tryna figure out how the life of the just vibes differently from that of the unjust has got a lot more to consider.

"and what’s the next question?" he asked.

surely, i said, it’s the one that follows in line. since only philosophers can really vibe with the eternal and unchangeable, and anyone roaming in the messy, variable zone ain’t a philosopher—i gotta ask: which of these two crews should be ruling our state?

and how can we even answer that deets?

whichever crew is best suited to guard our state’s laws and setups—let them be our ultimate guardians.

bet.

and i mean, can there even be any doubt that a guardian charged with keepin’ things in order should have legit eyes instead of just stumbling blind?

no question about it.

and aren’t those folks who are seriously lacking in true knowledge about the real nature of every single thing—who got zero clear pattern in their core, and who, like a painter with busted vision, can’t peep the absolute truth or trace it back to that original vibe to set up laws about beauty, goodness, and justice in this world (if they aren’t already set up), and who can’t even keep that order locked down—aren’t those peeps just, like, straight-up blind?

truly, he replied, they’re mad blind in that condition.

and will they be our gatekeepers when there’s others who, besides being on fleek in experience and never falling short on any virtue drip, also know the real tea on every single thing, no cap?

there’s zero reason, he said, to ghost those rocking the ultimate flex of qualities—they gotta always be frontliners unless they totally flop in another vibe.

so then, i was like, what if we figure out just how far they can mash these next-level excellences together?

bet.

first off, like, as we peeped from the jump, we gotta get the 411 on what a philosopher’s vibe really is. we need to vibe-check him, and once we’re on the same page, then—if i’m not trippin’—we’re gonna admit that this epic squad synergy is totally possible, and only those who flex that whole plug combo should be the big bosses of the state.

what u mean?

imagine if philosophical minds are always down to soak up that kind of knowledge which spills the eternal tea—that truth that never gets sus from generation to generation.

facts.

and then i was like, also, let’s be real: they stan all that is 100% real; there’s no piece of existence—big or small, extra or low-key—they’d hustle to keep, just like we said about the lovebirds and the go-getters.

deadass.

and if they’re gonna be exactly what we just dropped, isn’t there another drip they gotta have?

what quality?

truthfulness: they won’t ever let fake news crash their brain—they straight up despise lies and are all heart for the real tea.

facts, that totally checks out.

“maybe,” my dude, i replied, ain’t the move—you gotta say “must be affirmed:” cuz anyone who’s got that love vibe in their core can’t help but stan anything tight with the object of his crush.

right on, he said.

and is there anything closer to wisdom than the real tea?

how would there even be?

can someone flex as both a wisdom stan and a fake news fanboy?

nah, never.

so the true learning stan must, from day one, if he can, chase every truth, right?

100%.

but real talk: we all know that if someone’s hella hungry for one vibe, then their other cravings are gonna be low-key slack—they’re like a stream getting rerouted into another channel, ya feel?

facts.

someone who’s all about chasing every kind of knowledge is gonna be so deep in soul vibes that physical pleasures become meh—assuming he’s a legit philosopher and not a total poser.

no doubt, fr.

that type is guaranteed to be chill af and the total opposite of greedy; cuz the vibes that make most peeps chase clout and cash just ain’t in his playlist.

big facts.

another ticker for the philosopher vibe gotta be looked at too.

what’s that, tho?

there shouldn’t be any hidden cringe of closed-minded vibes; nothing’s more sus than throwing shade or being petty to a soul always thirstin’ for the full deets of everything divine and human.

preach, he said.

so how can someone with a mega lit mind, who’s out here peeping all the vibes of time and existence, even give two shits about just human life?

nah, fam.

or will that kind of brain be shook by death and its vibes?

nope, not at all.

so a cowardly, basic vibe ain’t invited to the real philosophy party, right?

surely not.

or like, can someone who’s got that perfectly balanced drip—who’s not jealously basic, petty, flexin’, or scared—ever end up being shady or extra brutal in his dealings?

not even close.

so you’ll peep real quick if someone is all fair and chill or straight-up rude and extra AF; these are the obvious signs, even from a young age, that separate philosophy OGs from total noobs.

facts.

another tea drop that needs to be spilled.

what’s the tea?

whether he’s vibin’ with learning or not; ‘cause no one’s gonna stan something that straight up hurts and leaves them grindin’ with barely any level ups.

definitely not.

and again, if he’s stuck on forgetful mode and can’t lock down what he learns, isn’t he just a ghost vessel?

totally.

if he puts in all that work for nada, he’s gonna end up hatin’ himself and his flop hustle, right? yes.

so a soul that’s all forgetful isn’t in the true philosopher squad; we gotta insist a legit philosopher’s got savage memory skills, right?

fact.

and again, a vibe that’s off-key and not on fleek can only get extra unbalanced, right?

for sure.

so, u think truth is more like a perfect balance rather than total chaos?

balance, 100%.

then along with all these sick traits, we gotta scout for a mind that’s naturally balanced and mad graceful—the kind that automatically vibes with the real essence of everything, no cap.

fact.

and like, don’t all these vibes together form the ultimate must-have for a soul to fully live its best existence?

they’re a must, he replied.

and shouldn’t that be a lit journey that only those blessed with epic memory and quick wit—noble, chill, ride-or-die for truth, justice, courage, temperance, all squad goals—can even try?

even the jealousy god himself, he said, wouldn’t throw shade at such a pursuit.

and i said, for peeps like that, once they glow up with years and schooling, only them should be trusted to run the state.

here adeimantus jumped in and was like: "socrates, no one can even clap back at these statements; but when u drop lines like these, your listeners get hit with some wild feels—they start thinking they’re getting played at every step because they ain’t pro at tossing questions and answers. these little missteps stack up, and by the end, they feel like they’ve been totally yeeted, with all their old ideas flipped upside down. it’s like watching noob checkers players get boxed in by pros with zero moves left—ending up with nada to say in this word game, even though they were technically right all along. i’m just spitting facts based on what’s poppin’ right now. because anyone could say, even if they can’t nail every word, we all know for real that the philosophy squad—whether as young rookies in school or full-time deep thinkers in their prime—most of them turn into weird monsters, even total rogues, and the so-called best end up getting wrecked by the very hustle you be hyping."

obviously, he said.

so, u think those haters are totally off-base?

i can’t really say, he replied; but i’m lowkey curious—what’s your take?

check my answer: i think they’re 100% right.

then how u gonna justify saying that cities won’t stop being sus until philosophers run the show, when we all agree that philosophers are totally useless to city life?

u hit me with a question, i said, and the only answer is a lit parable.

yeah, socrates; and i bet that’s not your usual vibe, right?

i can tell, i said, that u’re lowkey cracking up at me for diving us into such a hopeless convo; but just chill and hear this parable, and then u’ll be even more LOL at how basic my imagination is: ‘cause the way the top-tier dudes get treated in their own cities is hella savage—there’s nothing on earth that compares; so if i gotta rep their vibe, i gotta go full fiction mode and whip up a figure made of wild mashups, like those legendary goat-stag unions you see in spicy pics.

picture this: a fleet or ship with a captain who’s majorly tall and strong compared to the crew, but lowkey he’s a bit hard of hearing and his eyesight is kinda sus, plus his navigation game is pretty weak.

the sailors are beefing over who’s gonna steer—everyone’s like “i got dibs” even though none of them ever got schooled in nav skills, can’t even name who dropped the knowledge or when, and they’re throwing mad shade that navigation can’t be taught—ready to yeet anyone who disagrees.

they swarm around the captain, literally begging and pleading to snag the helm; and if they don’t get their way and someone else gets chosen, they straight up off that person by killing or tossing them overboard—and after jamming the captain’s senses with booze or some wild drug, they pull a full-on mutiny, seize the ship, and go ham with the loot; then, eating and drinking, they cruise on their voyage just as degens do.

anyone who’s down with their squad and smart-ass helps them yank the ship from the captain’s grip—whether by brute force or smooth talk—gets mad props as sailor, pilot, able seaman; meanwhile, they diss any other dude by calling him a total waste-of-space; but real talk: a legit pilot’s gotta be all about tracking the calendar, seasons, sky, stars, winds, and every detail of his craft if he’s gonna be a true ship commander—and he must steer, no matter if peeps are down or not. the idea of merging boss authority with real steering skills never even popped off in their clique’s brain.

so in ships taken over by a mutiny, run by rebellious sailors, how’s the real pilot gonna be seen? won’t they roast him as a chatterbox, a star-gazer, a total useless scrub?

obviously, said adeimantus.

then you won’t even need, i said, an extra breakdown of this parable that vibes the true philosopher’s role in the state; cuz u already get it.

facts.

so, now imagine dropping this parable on some dude who’s shook that philosophers get zero props in their cities; break it down for him and try to flex that them getting mad honor would be even more extra.

i gotchu.

tell him this: when he calls the top philosophy fans useless to the rest of the world, he’s kinda right; but also let him know it’s on the people who won’t use them that’s the real weak link—not the philosophers. like, the pilot isn’t supposed to be out here begging the sailors to let him steer—that ain’t how nature vibes; and the idea that “the wise should knock on the rich’s doors” is straight-up fake news. the truth is, when you’re sick—rich or broke—you gotta hit up a doctor, and if you wanna be ruled, you go to someone who can actually rule. a ruler who’s any good shouldn’t be begging his squad to let him boss them around; even though today’s govs are on a whole other cringe level—they’re just like those mutinous sailors, while the real helmsmen are the ones they roast as useless star-gazers.

exactly so, he said.

so, for these reasons, among peeps like these, philosophy—the ultimate pursuit—isn’t gonna be hyped by the opposers; not that its haters do any more damage than the self-professed philosophy fans, who, as the accuser would say, are mostly total rogues with even the so-called best being useless—and i was like, totally agree.

facts.

and the reason why the good end up useless is now laid out, right?

deadass.

so, now should we slide into showing that the majority’s being hella rotten is unavoidable and that it’s not fair to blame philosophy any more than anything else?

bet.

and let’s do a q&a sesh, starting with the gentle, noble vibe. truth, as u remember, was his main squad leader—always in the mix for everything; if he flopped on that, he was just a poser who didn’t belong in true philosophy.

facts, that's what was said.

so, isn’t this one trait, among others, totally at odds with how folks see him nowadays?

for sure, he said.

and can we not stan in his defense that a real knowledge stan is always hustlin’ to be—that’s just his nature; he won’t chill in a crowd of superficial peeps, but will keep grinding—the sharp edge never dulled and his fire never fizzled until he snagged the deets on the true nature of every essence, powered by a soul squad that totally clicks, drawing near, mixing up, and merging with true being—birthing pure mind and truth—then he’ll level up and live for real, and only then will he finally chill from his grind.

nothing, he said, could be more on point than that description.

and will a philosopher ever vibe with lies at all? won’t he straight up hate fake news?

he sure will.

and when truth’s the captain, there’s no way the crew he rolls with is shady, right?

impossible, fam.

plus, justice and chill vibes will tag along, with temperance trailing right behind?

true that, he replied.

also, there’s zero point in me re-dropping the philosopher’s virtues—courage, magnificence, smarts, memory, all that came naturally to him. and u did throw shade that, even though no one could deny my drops back then, when you peep the facts, some peeps described that way are obviously useless and most are just straight-up depraved; so we had to dive into why the majority are bad, which naturally circled us back to breaking down what a true philosopher really is.

exactly.

and next, we gotta talk about the corrupt vibes in philosophy—why so many get totally wrecked while only a few keep it 100% pure. i’m talking about those labeled useless but not outright evil—and then, after that, we’ll drop on the philosophy imposters: what kind of peeps chase a vibe that’s way out of their league, living unworthy, and with all their cray inconsistencies, drag philosophy and all its homies into that universal shade we keep dishing.

what are these corruptions, tho? he asked.

let me spill the tea: everyone can agree that a nature packed with all the dope qualities we require in a philosopher is a rare plant—like, a legendary, one-of-a-kind specimen that almost never shows up among humans.

super rare, fr.

and oh my god, countless savage forces are out here straight tryna wreck these rare vibes!

what kinda causes, tho?

first off, they got their own epic virtues—courage, temperance, etc.—and every one of these dope traits (and yo, it’s wild) can actually wreck and sidetrack a soul from hardcore philosophy.

that’s hella weird, he replied.

then there’s all the usual life perks—beauty, money, muscle, status, and major state clout—you know the drill—these too can totally corrupt and distract.

i feel that; but i gotta know more precisely what u mean about those.

grasp the tea as a whole, i said, in the right vibe; then u won’t trip trying to decode my earlier drops, and they won’t seem weird to u anymore.

and how am i supposed to do that? he asked.

well, i said, think of it like this: all seeds or tiny life germs—be it plant or animal—when they don’t get the proper nourishment, climate, or soil for their level of litness, become even more sensitive to missing that vibe, ‘cause bad juju is a way bigger enemy to something that’s good than to stuff that’s just meh.

facts.

and it makes sense that the dopest vibes, when planted in totally foreign soil, get wrecked even harder than the basic ones—‘cause the contrast is mad intense.

word.

and can we say, adeimantus, that the most extra gifted minds, when ruined by bad schooling, end up being crazy toxic? like, don’t the worst crimes and pure evil vibes spring from full-on nature trashed by education rather than from being low-key basic, while the weak ones barely pull off any epic good or epic evil?

i totally think you're right there.

and our philosopher follows the same vibe—like a plant that, when nurtured right, is destined to bloom into pure virtue; but if planted in trashy soil, he turns into the nastiest weed ever, unless some divine force keeps him in check. do u really think, as ppl always say, that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private tutors mess 'em up in any major way? aren’t the folks spouting that stuff the ultimate sophists? they totally school everyone—young, old, men, and women—and shape them after their own vibe.

when does that even go down? he said.

when they all link up, and the whole squad chills at an assembly—be it in a court, a theatre, a camp, or any poppin’ spot—and there’s a wild uproar, with peeps hyping some things and dissing others, blowing everything way out of proportion, with yelling and clapping that bounces off the rocks and the whole place doubling the noise—won’t a young man’s heart, as they say, get a major jump? can any private schooling help him stand firm against the tidal wave of squad opinion, or will he just ride the wave? won’t he end up thinking just like the masses—doing what they do, being what they are?

yes, socrates; necessity’s gonna force him, no cap.

and yet, i said, there’s an even bigger deal that hasn’t been dropped yet.

what’s that, tho?

it’s the low-key force of being totally canceled, confiscated, or even facing death—which, as u know, these new sophists and educators (the public, basically) throw down when their words lose power.

yup, they do; and for real, no cap.

so, what opinion of any other sophist or random peep can even compete in such a lopsided showdown?

none at all, he replied.

nah, i said, even trying is a crazy fool move; there’s never been, isn’t now, and won’t ever be any kind of character who hasn’t gotten their virtue drip solely from public opinion—i’m talking human virtue only; anything beyond that, as the old saying goes, doesn’t count: i don’t want u to be in the dark that in this messed-up state of governments, whatever gets saved and turns good is straight up saved by god’s power, real talk.

i totally agree, he replied.

so lemme get u to vibe with one more observation.

what’s u gonna drop?

why, so all these mercenary peeps that the squad calls sophists—and basically labels as their haters—are lowkey only teaching the mainstream opinions, the vibes of the crew; and that, my dudes, is their so-called wisdom. i’d compare them to a bro who studies the moods and cravings of a savage beast he feeds—learning how to vibe with that beast, figuring out when it’s lit or when it’s sus, what all its cries even mean, and which sounds chill it out or flip it into rage; and yo, imagine that when he’s been grinding on these beast-mode lessons long enough, he straight up calls his clout “wisdom” and turns it into a system or art form he then flexes, even though he’s hella clueless about what he’s really saying when he chats about these vibes or passions—labeling stuff as honorable or cringey, good or evil, just or bogus, all based on the mood of that mega brute. like, he’s all “good” if it’s what makes the beast hype and “evil” if it’s not; and he can only explain it by saying the legit and noble are just the must-haves—despite never actually peeping the deep diff between them. for real, wouldn’t such a dude be a rare educator?

for sure, bet.

so, how is the dude who thinks wisdom is just about reading the vibes of the random mob—whether in art, beats, or politics—any different from the one i just roasted? cuz when a guy hangs with the masses and flexes his poem, art, or state service, letting them be his judges even when he ain’t forced to, the so-called necessity of diomede got him droppin’ whatever gets mad praise. yet the excuses they drop to back up their own ideas of what’s “honor roll worthy” and “good” are literally clown-level. have you ever peeped any that weren’t straight-up bogus? nah, and i seriously doubt we ever will.

you feelin’ the truth of my tea? then peep this: will the world ever get on board with the idea of absolute beauty instead of just a whole buffet of “meh, pretty” stuff, or the idea of one dope, one-of-a-kind vibe instead of a remix of basics? def not.

so, the world ain’t ever gonna be philosophical? impossi-bro.

and that means philosophers are always gonna catch clout and flak from the masses, right? they gotta.

what about those peeps who squad up with the mob just to score likes? obviously, fr.

so, can a true philosopher stick to his vibe till the end? remember, we were all like, he’s gotta have mad speed, memory, guts, and that major flex—those are the real philosopher’s gifts. facts.

so, wouldn’t a dude like that, even from day one, be first in everything—especially if his bod is as fire as his brain? straight up, bet.

and his crew and fellow citizens will totally ride his wave as he levels up, right? no cap. they’ll be all down at his feet, sliding in with favs and flattery, tryna scoop that power he’s gonna rock someday. and that literally happens all the time.

so, what’s a dude like him gonna do when he’s in a big, bougie city—loaded, noble, and that tall, proper youth vibe? won’t he be dripping with epic dreams, thinking he can boss around both hellenes and barbarians, letting that hype inflate him with extra vain pomp and cringe pride? for sure, bet.

but when he’s riding that ego-high, if some chill homie slides up and gently goes, “yo, you’re a fool, and you gotta grind for real understanding,” do you think he’ll just chill and listen? nah fam, he ain’t tryna.

and even if a genuinely chill dude has his eyes popped a bit and gets humbled by philosophy, how his ride-or-die crew gonna act if they figure out they’re about to lose that clout from his company? they’ll straight-up do and say anything to block him from leveling up to his better self, even throwing shady plots and public drama to make his mentor look weak. no doubt, fr.

so, how can a dude caught in that mess ever glow up into a true philosopher? impossi-bro.

so, weren’t we dead on when we said even the dopest traits that should make someone a philosopher, if he’s mis-educated, can totally sidetrack him from the philosophical grind—just like having mad coins and bling can distract you from the real tea? deadass, correct.

so, my lit bestie, that's how we end up with all that epic wreckage and failin’ vibes from the peeps who were supposedly built for the top-tier pursuits; these rare vibes come from a squad that births the ones who can either drop the sickest baddies on states and peeps or flip the script to deliver major good when the vibe’s right. lowkey, a small-time dude never pulls off any mega moves for individuals or states. facts, 100% true.

and so philosophy gets left lonely af, her wedding vibes totally incomplete—her own crew bails and ditches her, and while they’re out here livin’ that bogus life, some trash peeps, seeing she got no ride-or-die homies to back her, roll in and disrespect her, slapping on all the shade like “your followers are total trash and deserve the savage smackdown.” yeah, that’s literally what everyone’s gossipin’.

yes; and what else could you expect when you peep these tiny, basic creatures who, spotting this land open to them—a land stocked with flashy names and clout titles—dip outta their lame gigs into philosophy like it’s the ultimate flex; those who jump in are probably the savviest wreckers of their own boring trades. even if philosophy’s in a sus state, she still carries a vibe and dignity that the arts just can’t match. and fr, many get drawn to her even if they’re imperfect and their souls are wrecked like their basic hustles—inevitable, right? facts.

aren't they exactly like a balding little tinker who just bounced outta prison and hit the jackpot; who takes a fresh scrub, rocks a new drip, and shows up all decked like a groom ready to flex marrying his boss’s daughter, leaving the OG broke and bitter? straight fire parallel, no cap.

so, what’s gonna come out of these clapped-out unions? ain’t they gonna be totally trash and bastardized? obvious, fr.

and when unqualified peeps try to roll with philosophy—teaming up with someone way above their league—what kind of ideas they gonna spit? won’t it be just fluff sophisms that sound all catchy but are empty and totally lack that genuine sauce of true wisdom? no cap, that's facts.

then, adeimantus, the real-deal disciples of philosophy are gonna be a tiny elite squad: maybe a noble, well-educated homie stuck in exile, who stays loyal to philosophy 'cause there’s no shady drip around; or a high-key soul born in a sketch city whose politics he straight-up disses; and maybe a few gifted bros who ditch the arts—which they rightfully hate—and jump onto the philosophy train; or perhaps some even get kept in check by our boy theages’ leash, since literally everything in his life tried to steer him off philosophy, but bad health saved him from all that political beef. my own internal sign case? Extra AF, and you rarely, if ever, see another dude with such a next-level monitor.

those in this elite club have totally tasted how sweet and blessed philosophy is, and they’ve seen so much crazy mass madness; they know straight up that no politician is hella honest, nor is there any justice warrior worth riding with to save the day.

such a bro is like a dude who falls among savage wild beasts—he won’t join in the shady antics of his crew, but he also can’t, solo, yeet back all their fierce vibes; so, seeing he wouldn’t be flexing any help for the state or his squad, and knowing his life would just be doomed with no gains, he stays lowkey, holds his peace, and rolls solo. he’s like a dude who, in the midst of a dusty, sleety storm whipped by savage winds, finds chill shelter behind a wall; and spotting the world dripping with bad vibes, he’s content just to live his own life, staying pure and free from evil, bouncing out in peace with high hopes.

yeah, and he’ll have dropped a legendary legacy before he peace-signs out. a mega flex work, yes; but not the ultimate, unless he finds a state that totally vibes with him—because in the perfect state, he’d grow big time and be the savior of his country and himself.

the tea on why philosophy got such a trash rep has been spilled, and the injustice of the haters is clear—any more tea you wanna drop? nah, nothing more on that track; but i wanna know, which government out there do you think is actually built for philosophy?

none of 'em, i said; and that's exactly the beef i got with them—not one of these states is worthy of true philosophical vibes, so philosophy ends up warped and alienated; just like an exotic seed dropped in a foreign turf that loses its drip and gets drowned out by the new soil, philosophy’s growth, instead of staying lit, degenerates and morphs into something else.

but if philosophy ever vibes with a state that's as perfect as she is, then it proves she’s actually divine, and everything else—be it human nature or institutions—is just human AF; and now, i know you’re gonna ask, which state is that?

nah, he said; you're off track, cuz i was about to throw another question—like, is it the state we built and invented, or some other one?

yes, i replied, mostly ours; but remember when i dropped that a live authority is always needed in a state—someone rocking that same lit blueprint you had as a legislator when you were laying down the laws.

true that, he replied.

yeah, but not in a chill way; you lowkey shook us by throwing up objections, proving that this convo is gonna be super long and hella tough—like, nothing left but the opposite of easy.

so, what’s left then?

the big question is how to school philosophy without wrecking the state: every epic flex comes with its risks; as the squad says, “hard is the good.”

still, he said, once we clear up the deets, the whole inquiry will be set.

i ain’t gonna be held back by a lack of will, but maybe by a lack of power—check my zeal, fr; and peep this: i boldly declare that states should be chasing philosophy, not like they do now, but with a whole new vibe.

how so?

right now, i said, philosophy students are hella young; starting almost straight outta kiddie status, they only use the leftover time from hustlin’ cash and adulting to study philosophy; and even those tagged as super philosophical, when faced with the mad difficulty of stuff—i mean, dialectic—they yeet outta there. later on, when someone else invites them to a lecture, they make a big scene over it, 'cause they don’t really see philosophy as their main hustle; and eventually, when they’re older, most of them totally fizzle out like heraclitus’ sun—never to glow again. (heraclitus dropped that the sun goes out every evening and relights every morning.)

so what should their game plan be?

flip the script. in childhood and youth, what and how much they learn should match their chill years: while they’re growing from kid to man, the focus should be on buffin’ up that bod so it can serve philosophy later; as life levels up and the brain matures, let them boost the mental gymnastics; but once our citizens are done with civil and military hustle, let them live freely with zero heavy grind—so they can live their best life now and cap it with epic happiness later.

yo, socrates, you’re hella serious, fr, he said; i know it; but most of your peeps, i reckon, will be even more deadset on opposing you, and ain’t never gonna get your vibe—thrasymachus especially, no cap.

yo, chill with beefing between thrasymachus and me, i said, cuz we’re now homies even though we were never haters; i’mma keep grinding until i either convert him and the crew or drop something that boosts them for that next life where we can all vibe together again.

but you’re talking about a time that’s, like, not even on the horizon.

nah, i replied, it’s like a timeframe that’s nothing compared to eternity. still, i ain’t shocked the masses don’t believe—cuz they’ve never seen the real deal we’re plotting; they only peep a boring knockoff of philosophy, a jumble of words that’s all manufactured, not like our natural organic vibe.

but a human who’s perfectly sculpted in word and deed into the ideal of virtue—then ruling a city that straight-up mirrors that drip—have y’all ever even seen that? nah, for real.

no, my friend, and they’ve barely ever caught those free and noble vibes—like when someone drops real talk, hustlin’ every tool in the book to chase truth and knowledge, while straight-up ignoring petty controversy that’s all about opinions and beef, whether in courts or in the streets.

they’re total strangers to that real talk, he said.

and that’s what we predicted, and truth made us admit—with mad hesitation—that no city, state, or individual will ever hit peak perfection until that tiny elite squad of philosophers (whom we once called “useless but not trash”) ends up divinely forced to run the state, whether they like it or not, and until the state is compelled to vibe with them; or until kings, or if not kings, then princes and royal offspring, get mad divinely inspired with a real love for true philosophy.

whether one or both of those moves are possible, i see lil’ reason to doubt: cuz if that were the case, we’d be roasted as just a bunch of dreamers and visionaries. right?

deadass.

so, if in the countless ages past—or even right now in some far-out foreign plug—the ultimate philosopher is, was, or will be forced by a higher power to boss the state, then we’re ready to bet our lives that our constitution has been, is, and will be—yeah, whenever the muse of philosophy reigns. there’s zero impossibility here; we just admit it’s a tough flex.

my opinion’s on point with yours, he said.

but are you saying the masses aren’t on the same page?

i’d imagine not, he replied.

oo, my friend, i said, don’t come for the masses: they’ll flip their minds if, not all savage-like but gently—aiming to chill them out and erase their hate for over-education—you show them your real philosophers and break down their true vibe like you just did; then peeps will see that the dude you’re talking about is nothing like they thought, and they’ll switch up their take and reply with a whole new strain. who can beef with someone who’s all love—someone so chill and envy-free that there’s no reason for jealousy? nah, lemme break it down: this harsh mood might pop up in a few, but not with most of mankind.

i totally vibe with you, he said.

and don’t you also think, like i do, that the mad beef the masses got against philosophy comes from those fake wannabes—those pretenders who roll in uninvited, always trashing philosophy and nitpicking, turning people into the spam of their chat instead of focusing on real substance? nothing is more cringe for a philosopher than that.

deadass, hella cringe.

cuz, adeimantus, the dude whose mind is locked on true being, ain’t got time to sweat the petty drama of earth, or be filled with malice and envy, beefing with fools; his eyes stay locked on those fixed, unchanging vibes, where nothing injures or gets injured, but all moves in sweet, orderly reason; these are his blueprint, and he raps his life to that beat as hard as he can. can a dude not mimic that vibe he’s so respectfully chatting about?

not even remotely possible.

and a philosopher who vibes with the divine order becomes all orderly and god-tier—as much as a human can—but like everyone else, he’ll catch some shade. obviously.

and if he’s forced to shape not just himself, but human nature as a whole—whether in states or with individuals—into that same divine template he sees elsewhere, do you think he’d be a clumsy builder of justice, chillness, and every civil virtue? anything but unskilful, my dude.

and if the world clocks that we’re droppin’ truth bombs about him, will they get triggered at philosophy? will they yeet us when we say that no state can be happy unless it’s designed by artists who flex the heavenly blueprint? they won’t be salty if they get it, he said. but how will they sketch out that master plan you’re vibing about?

they’ll start by grabbing the state and the vibe of humanity, like wiping off an old tablet to leave a fresh slate. it ain’t easy, fr. but whether it’s a breeze or savage work, that’s the diff between these legends and every other lawmaker—they won’t mess with individuals or the state, and won’t drop any laws until they’ve either discovered or crafted that clean slate.

yeah, for real, he said.

once they do that, they’ll sketch out a rough outline of the constitution—no doubt.

and when they’re filling in the details, i see them peepin’ both up and down: first gazin’ at absolute justice, beauty, and chill vibes, then at the human remix; blending all the elements of life into what becomes the image of a man—and all this done with that other epic vibe which, among peeps, homer calls the form and likeness of god.

so true, he said.

and one feature they be yeeted out, and another one be slid in, until human ways get remixed to be as lit as god’s vibes, no cap?

indeed, he said, there’s no remix that could drop a fresher pic.

and now, i said, are we finally low-key convincing those mobs you mentioned who charged at us like full send, that the constitution-making artist is exactly the dude we been hyping; the one who got so triggered 'cause we handed the state over to his clutches; and are they chillin’ a bit after our tea drop?

mad chill, if they even got half a brain.

where else could they scoop up any clout to diss us? will they ever doubt that the philosopher is all about truth and realness?

they wouldn’t be that extra.

or that his vibe, as we broke it down, is on the same level as the ultimate flex of good?

no doubt, they can’t even front that.

but then, will they come at us saying that a nature, when placed in the right drip, ain’t gonna be perfectly good and wise if ever? or are they gonna ride with those we already benched?

nah, fr.

then, will they still be salty about our clapback that until philosopher kings run the show, both states and individual peeps will never catch a break from bad vibes, and our dream state remains just a myth?

i think they’ll be way less heated.

so, can we assume they’re not just less salty but actually mellow, and that they’ve been converted—so messed up with shame that they literally can’t front any more?

by all means, he said.

then, let’s say the squad’s been patched up. can anyone throw shade at our point that there are legit royal spawn—like sons of kings or princes—born as straight-up philosophers?

surely not, he said.

and when these homies pop off, is anyone gonna dare claim they’ve gotta be yeeted out for sure; like, we all know they’re hard to save sometimes, but to say that through all the ages not a single one can survive—who’s bold enough to drop that?

who fr, indeed!

but, i said, one lit dude is enough; imagine one king with a city riding his vibe, who can flex and spawn that ideal squad of society that even the world finds incredulous.

yeah, one is enough.

the ruler can drop the laws and structures we been chatting about, and the citizens might just be cool with ‘em?

for real.

and for others to vibe with what we vibe with? that ain’t some next-level miracle or impossible flex?

i think not.

but we already proved, in the tea we dropped earlier, that if all this is even possible, it’s def the best glow-up ever.

facts.

and now we say not only that our lit-ass laws, if enacted, would be the ultimate, but even getting them off the ground—even though it’s a crazy grind—is totally doable.

big mood.

and so, after a ton of pain and hustle, we wrap one chapter, but there’s mad tea left—like, how and through what savage pursuits will these state-saviors be built, and at what ages do they dive into their different quests?

certainly.

i dipped out on that messy drama about having bae’s, making kids, and picking the rulers, 'cause i knew a perfect state would be so extra it’d spark major envy and be super hard to nail down; but that slick dodge didn’t help me 'cause i had to spill the deets anyway. the whole women-and-kids sitch is sorted, but the ruler convo gotta be kicked off from square one. we were saying, as you probs remember, that rulers gotta be mad in love with their country, proven through both the highs and the hella low pain, and that when things get rough, whether in hardships, dangers, or any critical moment, they absolutely must keep that patriotism on fleek—any dude who flops gets ghosted, but the one who stays pure, like gold tested in a savage fire, earns his crown, stacking honors in life and even in the afterlife. that was the vibe, and then the chat dipped and played it coy, not wanting to stir up the very tea that’s now on deck.

i totally remember, he said.

yeah, my friend, i said, and i kinda held back on dropping that next bold truth; but now, brace yourselves—i’m 'bout to confess that the perfect guardian MUST be a straight-up philosopher.

facts, he said—let that be locked in.

and don’t even think there’ll be a whole squad of them; 'cause the essential flexes we deem necessary rarely squad up together—they usually show up in bits and pieces.

what do you mean? he said.

look, i replied, you know that quick smarts, clutch memory, razor wit, and that clever drip don’t often roll together, and that peeps who rock them while being high-spirited and extra generous are usually too wild to live a chill and orderly life; they get driven all over by their impulses, and any real solid vibe just yeets out.

word, he said.

on the flip, those rock-solid, dependable souls—like, unshakable in any brawl and immune to fear—are just as likely to nap when it’s time for brain flex; they’re in a constant chill mode, prone to yawning and catching z’s over any heavy mental grind.

facts.

and yet, as we were saying, both that wild energy and that ultra-stable chill are essential for anyone getting the ultimate edu and stepping into leadership realness.

definitely, he said.

and are these rare gems gonna drop as a class that’s hard to come by?

yes, fr.

then any aspirant must not only get test-run through the savage labors, dangers, and spicy pleasures we mentioned earlier, but there’s another level-up trial we didn’t even flex before—he’s gotta get schooled in mad knowledge vibes to see if his soul can handle the ultimate boss-level knowledge or if it’s gonna straight up crash like any other weak attempt.

i’m with you on that, he said, you’re right on testing the grind. but what exactly do you mean by the absolute highest knowledge?

you remember, i said, that we chopped the soul into three parts and broke down the vibes of justice, chillness (temperance), courage, and wisdom?

true that, he said—if i’d forgotten that, i wouldn’t even deserve the next tea drop.

and do you recall that little heads-up we threw out before diving into those vibes?

what’s that about?

we were saying, if my mental wifi serves right, that anyone tryna peep them in their full, flawless drip must take the long, twisty road, which eventually leads to their full reveal; but we could also throw in a mainstream breakdown on the same level as our earlier chat. and you were like, “yo, that rundown’s cool enough,” so the convo kept rolling in a way that, to me, tossed off some major glitches; whether you’re vibing with it or not is on you.

yeah, he said—I and the squad thought you dropped a solid truth bomb.

but, my dude, i said, handing out only a half-ass measure of truth ain’t fair; nothing imperfect can set the standard, even if peeps are too lazy to search for the whole vibe and think a little is enough.

so true—people being lazy is a whole mood.

yeah, i said—and there’s no worse flex fail in a guardian for the state and its lit laws.

right on.

so the guardian, i said, has gotta be forced to take that longer detour, grinding hard in both learning and gym sessions, or he’ll never hit that supreme knowledge that's his true calling.

what, he said, is there some knowledge even higher than this—above justice and all them other virtues?

yes, i said, there totally is. and about the virtues, we shouldn’t be satisfied with just a rough sketch—they need the full, high-def drop. when even the tiniest deets get slaved over with endless effort so they shine with max clarity, how extra would it be to think the ultimate truths shouldn’t get that same 100% treatment?

a mad noble thought; but do you think we’ll hold back from asking what the ultimate knowledge really is?

nah, i said, ask all you want; but i’m pretty sure you’ve been served this answer on repeat, so either you ain’t vibing with me or, lowkey, you’re just being extra difficult; ‘cause you’ve heard time and again that the idea of good is the peak knowledge, and every other thing gets its clout only by channeling that. you can’t be clueless that i was 'bout to spill that tea—about which, like i've said a million times, we know barely anything; and without it, all other hustle or stash means jack squat. so, do you really think having all the other bits is worth it if we ain’t got the good? or stacking up all that knowledge if we’re missing out on the beauty and goodness vibe?

assuredly not.

and you know most peeps are like, “pleasure is the move” when it comes to good, whereas the real ones say it’s all about knowledge?

yes.

and you also know that the squad vibing with knowledge can’t even explain what they mean without resorting to saying “knowledge of the good” after all.

how absurd is that!

exactly, i said—they gotta start off roasting us for not knowing the good, then act like we’re all gurus of it—as if when they drop the term “good,” we totally get their vibes. that’s so extra.

most true, he said.

and those who hyped pleasure as the good? they’re just as lost; they gotta admit that there’s whack pleasure along with the fire ones.

for sure.

and so, to claim bad and good are, like, one in the same?

true.

there’s literally no way around the crazy maze of issues this question throws up.

no doubt.

furthermore, don’t we peep that a lot of folks are down to do, have, or front as if they’re all just and honorable without actually being the real deal; yet no one’s vibing with a fake glow—everyone’s chasing that real, raw good, because for the good, the fake just ain’t it.

he said, mad true.

so then, for a principle this huge—the ultimate end that every soul chases, even though they got a gut feeling it exists but then hesitate since they’re not fully clued in on its real nature and ain’t as sure about it as with everything else, losing out on all the extra good vibes—how can the best peeps in our state, the ones who hold all the power, be stumbling in the dark of ignorance?

def not, he said.

i’m 100% sure, i said, that anyone who doesn’t get that the beautiful and the just are also straight-up good will end up being a weak-ass guardian; and i seriously suspect that anyone clueless about the good won’t have any real 411 on them, period.

that, he said, is a savage suspicion of yours.

and if we end up with only one guardian who’s got this next-level knowledge, will our state be totally on fleek?

of course, he replied; but now, i gotta ask—do you vibe that this supreme good principle is straight-up knowledge, or pleasure, or something else entirely?

aye, i said, i knew a refined dude like you wouldn’t settle for someone rehashing basic opinions on these heavy deets.

true, socrates; but i gotta say, someone like you who’s clocked a lifetime deep in philosophy shouldn’t just echo the basic takes of others—time to drop your own next-level truth bombs.

but, then, does anyone really have the right to slap down a positive claim on something they don’t even fully know?

nah, he said—without that solid, 100%-on-lock certainty, nobody’s got the right to flex that; they can only throw out their hot takes as opinions.

and don’t you know, i said, that all mere opinions are kinda whack and, like, totally blind? you wouldn’t disagree that those who claim any “true notion” without real smarts are basically like blind peeps stumbling down a sketchy road, right?

very true.

and do you even wanna peep what’s shady, crooked, and basic, when others are here to drop gems about brightness and real beauty?

still, i gotta beg you, socrates, said glaucon, not to dip out just when you’re nearing the finish line; if you can just serve up an explanation of the good like you did with justice, calm, and the rest of the squad, we’ll be totally satisfied.

yes, my friend, i said, and i’d be just as hyped—but lowkey i’m scared of flopping and getting roasted by my own overeager hype. nah, my sweet bros, let’s not push to uncover the full-down nature of the good right now, 'cause reaching the thoughts in my brain is just too extra for me. but if you’re down, i can totally spill on the kid of the good—basically its mini-me—instead of just droppin’ the offspring tea.

by all means, he said—spill the deets on the kid, and you’ll forever be in our squad’s debt for the full parent saga.

i do wish, i replied, that i could drop the full account of the parent and not just the mini version; so, take this little bonus as interest, and know that i ain’t here to serve fake tea, even though i’m not out here tryna hoodwink you.

we’ll keep it 100 and take all the care we can—proceed.

yes, i said, but first i gotta vibe on the same wavelength with you and remind you of what i’ve been dropping throughout this chat and on so many other days.

what?

the old tea—that there’s a whole lot of beautiful and a whole lot of good, and the same goes for all the stuff we describe and name; for everything in that mix, we slap the label ‘many’ on it.

true, he said.

and then there’s one absolute beauty and one absolute good, and for all the other things we call ‘many,’ there’s an absolute too; they can be united under one vibe, which we call the essence of each.

mad true.

the many, like we say, are what we peep but don’t really get, and the ideas are the ones we truly know even though we never see them.

exactly.

and what’s the tool we use to check out all visible stuff?

the sight, he said.

and with our ears, i said, we catch sounds, and our other senses scoop up all the rest?

true.

but have you peeped that sight is, like, the most expensive and complicated masterpiece the original creator of our senses ever cooked up?

nah, i never pegged that, he said.

then think on it; does the ear or the voice need some extra add-on to do its thing—so that one can pick up sound and the other can be heard?

not at all.

no, indeed, i replied; and the same goes for pretty much all our other senses—you wouldn’t say any of them need a bonus feature, right?

definitely not.

but peep this: without an extra-level glow-up, there’s no way to see or be seen.

how you mean?

sight, as i’m vibing it, lives in the eyes; and if someone’s got eyes but they’re wishy-washy at peeping, even if colors are lit within them, unless there’s a third-level upgrade built just for that, the eye owner won’t peep a thing and those colors will just be invisible.

what kind of nature you talkin’ about?

i replied—it’s that drip you call light.

true, he said.

so, mad noble is the bond that hooks up sight and all things visible, and it’s way more epic than any other link because of that extra natural flex; 'cause light is their ride-or-die, and light is no basic, ignoble thing.

nah, he said—the total opposite of ignoble.

and which of the gods up in the heavens do you say is the boss of this whole element? who’s flexin’ that light that lets our eyes peep perfectly and makes the visible pop off?

you mean the sun, like you and literally everyone call it.

can we say the hookup between sight and that deity goes a little something like this?

how?

are you saying neither sight nor the eyeball itself is the sun?

no.

yet, out of all our sense tools, the eye is hella the most like the sun, right?

by far the most like.

and the power the eye’s got is like a drip that gets poured straight from the sun?

exactly.

so, the sun ain’t sight itself but is the OG author of sight—the one our peepers recognize as the source.

true, he said.

and this, i said, is who i call the child of the good, the one that the good spawned in its own epic likeness to rock the visible world—relating to sight and all that peeper stuff—just like the good is to the mind and all mental vibes:

can you break that down a bit more? he said.

why, you know, i said, that when eyes are pointed at stuff where the sun’s out—where day isn’t ghosting out, but it’s just moon and stars doing a slow-mo glow—the vision gets dim and almost blind; it’s like the clarity just dips out.

mad true.

but when they’re aimed at sunlit things, boom—they’re clear as day and that’s proper sight, right?

for sure.

and the soul is basically like the eye: when it lounges on what radiates truth and real being, it totally perceives, understands, and shines with mad smarts; but if it’s turned toward the twilight of fake, perishing vibes, then it’s stuck with just opinions—it keeps flipping from one opinion to another like no stable drip, barely flexing any real intelligence.

exactly.

now, the thing that gives truth to what’s known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i want you to call the idea of good—and you’ll vibe that it’s the main cause of science and truth, inasmuch as truth becomes the subject of knowing; and, since both truth and knowledge are mad beautiful, you’ll def rate this extra nature as even more stunning than either; and just like light and sight are, in a way, like the sun but aren’t the sun, so too science and truth may be seen like the good—but not the actual good; the good sits on a way higher pedestal.

how dope must that beauty be, he said, that which originates science and truth and yet outshines both; you can’t really be saying that pleasure is the good, right?

god forbid, i replied; but can i ask you to peep the image from another angle?

from which angle?

wouldn’t you say that the sun isn’t only the boss of making everything visible but also the plug for generation, nourishment, and mad growth, even though the sun itself isn’t about generating?

definitely.

in the same way, the good might be seen as not only the OG source of knowledge for all known stuff but also the vibe that gives their very essence, even though the good isn’t the essence itself—it totally exceeds essence in mad dignity and power.

glaucon, sounding hilariously serious, said: by the light of heaven, how amazing!

yes, i said, and you can blame your overdrive for making me drop all these wild fancies.

and please, keep spitting them out; at least, let us know if there’s more to the sun analogy.

yes, i said, there’s hella more.

then don’t leave out any single deet, however minor.

i’ll do my best, i said; but honestly, a ton might have to get chopped.

i hope not, he said.

so, picture this: there are two ruling powers—one that rules the intellectual realm and the other that runs the visible game. i’m not saying “heaven” because, trust, i ain’t tryna play with that name-drop (‘ourhanoz, orhatoz’ and all that). can i assume you got the diff between the visible and the intelligible on lock?

i have.

now, imagine a line cut into two uneven pieces, then split each piece again by the same ratio—let’s say the two main splits represent the visible and the intelligible. then, peep the subdivisions for how clear or hazy they are: you’ll see that the visible vibe is all about images. and by images, i mean, first off, shadows, and then, reflections in water and on smooth, polished, dope surfaces and the like—feel me?

yes, i understand.

now picture the other half, which isn’t just a copy, but includes all the real-deal animals we peep and every living thing or crafted vibe.

mad good.

would you admit that these two splits roll with different degrees of truth, and that the fake copy is to the original what the sphere of opinion is to the realm of straight-up knowledge?

most undoubtedly.

next, let's break it down: we gotta split the intellectual realm in a major way.

in what way, you ask?

so here's the tea: there are two subdivisions. in the lower squad, the soul flexes the figures from the first division as its inspo; this inquiry is totally hypothetical, and instead of leveling up to an ultimate principle, it dips down the other end. meanwhile, in the upper crew, the soul yeets past hypotheses and climbs up to a principle that’s already above the hypothesis game—no cap, it doesn’t even use images like before, just vibing purely in and through the ideas themselves.

"i do not quite understand your meaning," he said.

alright, imma hit you with a redo; you'll catch my drift once i drop some starter notes. you know how peeps studying geometry, arithmetic, and all those related sciences be assuming the odd, the even, the figures, three kinds of angles, and that sorta stuff in their various branches—these are their hypotheses, the baseline memes everyone is supposed to know, so they don’t even waste time explaining them to themselves or others; they just kick off with them and ride the wave until they finally, and in a straight-up consistent way, hit their conclusion?

"yes," he said, "i know."

and you already know that even though they’re using visible forms and chatting about them, they aren’t really about those physical vibes—they’re thinking about the ideals that these forms mimic; not the drawn-out figures, but the absolute square, the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms they sketch or whip up, which have their own shadows and water-reflections, get flipped into memes, but the real hustle is to peep the things themselves, which can only be seen with the mind’s eye.

that’s facts.

and this is what i meant by the intelligible squad—even though in the search for it the soul is forced to lean on some hypotheses; it doesn’t climb up to a first principle ‘cause it’s lowkey stuck in the hypothesis zone, but instead it uses objects whose shadows below are, in turn, turned into images that are extra clear and high-key valuable.

"i understand," he said, "so you're talking about the geometry crew and their sister arts."

and when i mention the other division of the intelligible, know that i'm dishing about that other type of knowledge where pure reason itself level ups via dialectic—using hypotheses not as the ultimate starters, but just as checkpoints, as stepping stones into a realm beyond hypotheses, so that it can soar past them to the first principle of the whole kit and caboodle; and by clinging to that and then to whatever builds on it, step by step, it descends again without leaning on any sensory drip—flowing from idea to idea until it ends completely in ideas.

"i get you," he replied; "not perfectly though, ‘cause you’re describing a task that’s, like, absolutely colossal; but, anyway, i understand that you're saying that knowledge and being—the stuff that dialectic scopes out—are way clearer than the so-called notions of the arts that are built only on hypotheses. these too are peeped by the mind, not by the senses; yet since they kick off with hypotheses instead of rising to a proper principle, the peepers on them aren’t really flexing their higher reason—unless, like, someone adds a first principle so the higher reason can actually vibe with them. and that habitual hustle in geometry and the related sciences, i guess you'd call that understanding and not pure reason, 'cause it sits between opinion and full-on reason."

"you totally nailed my drift," i said; "so now, matching up with these four divisions, let’s assign four mental faculties in the soul—reason being the top-tier, understanding the second, faith (or conviction) the third, and perception of shadows the last—and let’s set a scale where each faculty’s clarity matches the truth of what it’s all about."

"i understand," he replied, "and i’m down with your setup."
