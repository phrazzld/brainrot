oi muse, lemme drop the vibes on book twelve of the iliad,
where menoitios’s boy was stuck in his tent patching up some homie’s boo-boo
while the argives and trojans were out front beefing, no chill in sight.

they had that big trench plus a wide flex-wall around their fleet—
ngl it was a roughshod job, they didn’t even bribe the gods first,
just hammered it up to keep the trojans from yeeting their ships,
but the immortals were like “um that’s illegal,” so the wall’s days were numbered.

still, the trojan place was unburnt as long as daddy priam lived,
and swift achilles was sulking, so that makes the wall safe for a minute.
but after a bunch of trojan all-stars bit dust and argives too,
and troy fell in the tenth year (spoiler alert),
poseidon and apollo would eventually come clap that diy fortress,
flood it with righteous river rage, leveling every stone.

they’d just funnel streams from ida’s slopes—
the rages of heptaporos, grenikos, aesepos, and the rest,
and flush the entire wall with swirling torrent,
while zeus made it rain for nine days straight, no cap,
till neptune hammered the foundations with his trident,
scattering the argive sweat-labor to the waves.
then the shore would get smoothed over with fresh dunes,
the memory of that mortal wall eaten up by time.

anyway, that’s the future—at present, war raged hot and messy,
the trojans pressed the achaean ramparts with an ear-splitting clamor;
my guys were shook, pinned near their curvy ships,
knowing hector, big savage, was about to mow them down.

hector fought like a stormfront rolling in,
like a boar or lion cornered by hunters and hounds,
just pacing and flexing, teeth bared, refusing to yield—
that was hector up in the trojan squad, calling them forward:
“cross that ditch, y’all, no fear, we got it.”

but the horses squealed at the steep ditch-lip and spiked stakes,
like “nah fam, that’s terrifying,”
so polydamas stepped up, side-eyeing hector:
“dude, let’s keep it 100: forging straight through that moat is def sus.
sharp stakes, narrow path, horse spook central—
if father zeus truly wants us to steamroll these fools,
maybe we want to slide up on foot, leaving the whips behind?
that’s the bigger brain move, else we might all get bodied,
and not a single messenger will return to troy.”

hector’s like “bro, you wildin. i ain’t about them bird omens.
we vibe with big zeus, that’s all the sign we need.
if you wanna ghost the fight, bounce, but i’m charging in.
anybody else tries to bail? i’ll feed them my spear.”

boom, speech done, so the trojans hopped from their chariots.
charioteers parked the horses, homies swarmed as infantry,
and the thick squads formed up in wedge shape behind hector and polydamas.
paris and deiphobos, helenos, and asios led other waves,
then aeneas rolling with his crew, and from across the sea
sarpedon plus glaukos and asteropaios commanding the side hustle,
thirsty to smash the achaean wall, burn the hollow ships.

but asios refused to ditch his ride—
drove the chariot right at the gates, thinking he’d bust in easy,
but the lapith boys, polypoites and leonteus, posted up there,
like old mountain oaks that stand unmoved in storms,
they blocked the entry so hard that asios ended up lamenting,
cursing zeus for letting him think trojans could breeze right through.

meanwhile the rest of the trojan squads hammered different gates,
a storm of men and thunder of arms pounding everything at once.
the lapith duo dished out savage hits from the parapets:
rocks raining like thick snow, so many pitched missiles from above
that shields rattled and heads rang on both sides.
the trojans freaked for a second seeing snake omens from an eagle overhead,
but polydamas again tried to be that cautious voice:
“uh, that eagle dropping a living viper? that’s not a cute sign,
maybe we should hold off.”

hector scowled: “miss me with that negative vibe.
i trust big z, not weird fluttering wings.
stop wigging out. we press on.”

zeus then blasts a wind from ida’s slopes, swirling dust into achaean eyes,
buffing trojan morale while the achaean hearts sank.
the trojans seized the moment, yanking out blocks from the rampart,
prying the stakes, toppling the towers.
the danaans tried to hold with thick bullhide shields from within,
but line by line the trojans chipped away.

both aiante (big ajax and lil ajax) patrolled the wall,
yelling at their bros to stand firm or else:
“guys, this is do-or-die. show up or get clowned.
don’t back up to the ships, keep pressing forward—
zeus might still give us the w.”

like winter snow the stones flew from either side,
the dust soared up to the sky, and the clang was ear-splitting.
still the trojans couldn’t breach the gates,
until father zeus decided to sweeten the pot for sarpedon,
king of lycia, who came at the wall like a starved lion on a stable.

he rocked a dope shield with gold studs, two big spears in his fists,
charging forward to bust the rampart.
he hype-talked glaukos: “yo, we’re top dogs in lycia,
feasting on the best cuts, always respected.
time to prove we earned that seat. let’s claim some glory, or face doom.”

then they advanced, the lycians behind them,
and menestheus saw them, freaked out, but the noise was so lit
he couldn’t even call the aiante for help.
he sent a herald to fetch them anyway:
“tell the ajax bros we got big trouble—lycian lords on the come-up.”

in no time big ajax plus teucer arrived with his bow,
pandiôn trailing to carry extra gear.
they found the lycians swarming the wall,
and sarpedon’s buddy got wrecked by a big stone from ajax,
splattering brains as he fell like a rag doll.

teucer tagged glaukos in the arm with an arrow,
knocked him back from the fight.
sarpedon fumed for his wounded bro but still pressed the rampart,
spearing alcmaon, hauling down part of the parapet,
ripping it open with his bare hands so the trojans could stream in.

ajax lunged and teucer loosed another arrow but zeus deflected it,
sparing sarpedon, so the blow just skimmed him.
still, the trojans rallied at sarpedon’s roar:
“why you all letting me solo tank this place? push with me!”
the lycians obeyed, and the achaean lines flexed in response,
nobody could break the deadlock, the fight was that savage.

like two farmers squabbling over boundary stones in a field,
they measured spear-thrust for spear-thrust on top of the wall.
blood was everywhere, stone ramparts stained with red,
but the achaeans never caved—they matched blow for blow
till father zeus gave hector the final shine.

he lifted a giant rock (dude was built),
bigger than two normal guys could even budge,
but the son of crooked-minded kronos made it weightless in his hands.
he hurled it at the towering gates, smashing the door beams—
the planks split, the hinges coughed splinters,
the entire gate caved, and hector vaulted in,
shining in bronze like night incarnate, eyes blazing like a man possessed.

he bellowed for trojans to charge, they poured over the broken doors,
or swarmed in directly behind him, unstoppable.
the danaans reeled, stumbling back toward their hollow ships,
and you could hear the war-cry echo from the huts to the open sea.
