yap, divine hype, about how nestor heard that war-noise even while posted up sippin’ from his fancy cup,
and how he said to his boy machaon, legit asclepius’ spawn, “bro, peep those vibes out by the boats.
some next-level screaming over there. we gotta see what’s up. but you stay posted, keep the wine flowing,
let that babe hecamede hook you up with a warm bath, wash off that gnarly gore.
meanwhile, i’m finna dip real quick and check the scoreboard.”

so old nestor snagged his son’s shining shield, lying around in thrasy-medes’ tent, that slick polished bronze.
the old man held the spear, edged in hype-level metal, and went out. from outside the shelter he had front-row seats
to see the trojans absolutely sending it, forcing the achaean wall to fold.

it was like the ocean, swirling purple, all moody under hush-hush winds, not sure whether to bust some huge wave
or just chill—waiting for zeus to deal out that on-brand gust. nestor’s mind was swirling like that,
caught between sliding into the thick of the fighting with the horse-taming danaans, or hooking up with lord agamemnon.
he decided it was time for the big boss meeting, so off he went.

agamemnon, diomedes, and odysseus, war-weary, were gathering up from the beach,
a ways behind the front lines because the boats were pulled up close to the sand, behind a shaky makeshift wall.
the place was cramped af—plus the line of ships was mad long, so the greeks had to cluster near the shore.
these three kings, banged up from the scrap, were in their feels. nestor rolled up,
and seeing them in that gloom cracked his own spirit a bit.

agamemnon was like, “oh nestor, big ups to you, father-figure of the achaean squad, why you bailing on the front lines?
i’m worried hector’s flex about burning our ships might come true. dude was always crowing about slapping fire
on our ride home and capping us all before we can bounce. looks like it’s about to get real, no cap.
achilles is big salty in his tent, but i fear the rest of these bum achaians might also be letting me hang dry.”

nestor snapped back, “bro, i feel you. the wall we banked on is basically scuffed,
and trojans are legit brawling by the hulls. you can’t even tell who’s who in the chaos.
we gotta figure out a strategy, because honestly, we’re too messed up to throw hands ourselves.”

agamemnon sighed, “our ditch, our fancy fortifications—they’re all worthless.
zeus must be big mad at us. i used to think he had our back, but now he’s chain-locking our arms or something.
let’s drag the first ships into the water, keep ‘em anchored out there so we can dip if the trojans steamroll us.
it’s not pretty, but i’d rather bounce in the darkness than get absolutely murked.”

then wily odysseus side-eyed him: “yo, what crackhead vibes are you spitting, atreus’ boy? that’s not the wave.
you can’t just bail. that’s instant meltdown, homie. the trojans would see us messing with the ships and they’d
press ‘w’ so hard we’d never get out. do not do that. that’s a suicidal vibe.”

agamemnon shot back, “dang, odysseus, you read me to filth. i wasn’t ordering people to haul the ships—
i was just thinking out loud. if someone’s got a better plan, i’m all ears.”

diomedes, the g, stepped in: “listen up, my guys. i may be the youngest in the group, but i come from a real one,
tydeus. i got that legit lineage, so don’t write off my words. we gotta front up,
even with wounds, and fire up the rest of the squad. let’s get back out there,
though we keep ourselves behind the main fray so we don’t catch some random spear in the chest.”

everyone was feeling that, so they marched out, with the war god’s vibes swirling in the air.
then, incognito, poseidon strolled in among them, looking like some old soldier, grabbed agamemnon’s hand,
and said, “my guy, i see achilles must be living for this—watching your meltdown from his tent,
but i’m telling you, the gods still might bless you if you stand tall. the trojans are about to catch your fade.”

then the earth-shaker roared so loud it sounded like ten thousand squads screaming bloodlust,
filling every achaean’s heart with unstoppable courage to keep throwing hands.

meanwhile, up on olympus, queen hera saw her bro poseidon stunting for the greeks,
and she side-eyed zeus perched on ida’s peak. she was like, “i gotta distract that thunder daddy.”
she plotted some major cosmic catfish. she would seduce him, slip him into that post-climax nap,
so poseidon could keep boosting the greek squad.

so hera dipped into her room, locked the door with that secret key hephaestus made,
cleaned up with sweet ambrosial oils, pinned back her hair so luscious,
put on her best drip—like, she was turning heads, no question.
then she snagged aphrodite aside, all hush-hush: “baby girl, i need that big love-lust vibe,
the one that enslaves gods and mortals. i’m going to smooth over some drama with oceanus and tethys,
and i need them super enthralled.”

aphrodite, all sweet, was like, “bet, you’re the queen, i won’t front on you.”
she handed her that embroidered belt full of heartbreak spells and flirty illusions—“with this, you can make anyone
simp for you.”
hera laughed in her own cunning way, stuffed the belt in her bosom, and zoomed off.

next stop, lemnos, she found hypnos, brother of death, and bribed him:
“knock zeus out after i seduce him, i’ll hook you up with a goddess wife from the younger charities—pasithea,
the one you’re thirsting for.”

hypnos was like, “dang, last time i helped you do that, zeus wilded out and i had to hide behind nyx so he didn’t
yeet me into the ocean. i’m not trying to get canceled by the thunder god.”
but hera swore the strongest oath on styx that he’d get pasithea, so hypnos was down.

they soared to ida. hypnos perched in a tall pine to watch. hera approached zeus on gargaron peak.
zeus saw her and got that immediate thirst. he was like, “babe, i want you so bad,
never wanted you or any goddess or mortal chick more. let’s get it on right here.”

hera gave him that “aw shucks, your place or mine?” line, said they should maybe step behind closed doors,
but zeus was like, “nah, i got a golden cloud that’ll cloak us. not even helios can see.”
so they got busy on the mountaintop. earth sprouted a cushy bed of flowers under them,
and they dozed off in that sweet love-lull. hypnos swiftly put the big man to sleep.

poseidon clocked that and turned up the volume on the battlefield, yelling at the argives:
“achaeans, y’all seriously gonna let hector waltz in and burn your ships? i say we flex now.
gear up. i’ll lead you. let’s see if he can keep fronting with the war-lords all in.”

everyone hopped to. they traded smaller shields for bigger ones, put on helmets, grabbed long spears.
the wounded kings, even messed up, were reorganizing the gear so the best fighters had the best kit.
poseidon brandished a sword that shone like lightning, unstoppable.

hector, on the trojan side, tried to rally as well. so they lined up: unstoppable force meets unstoppable force.
the sound was wilder than a storm wave smashing a beach in a northerly gale,
or a blazing wildfire roaring in the forest, or a savage wind howling in the tall oak groves.
it was just the massive outcry of trojans and achaean squads slamming into each other.

mighty hector pitched a spear at ajax (the tall one), but the straps across ajax’s chest—one for the shield, one for the sword—
saved him. hector raged, fell back to his crew. big ajax snatched up a rock from the ground,
launched it, and hammered hector in the chest near the throat, spinning him like a top.
he slammed to the dirt like a lightning-struck oak. he dropped his spear, shield, helmet,
and the trojans freaked out. they snatched him up and lugged him away from the slaughter,
brought him by the swirling xanthus, let him catch his breath. blood poured from his mouth,
and he blacked out. the trojans, seeing their champion down, got shaky, and the achaean crew pressed in.

oïlean ajax skewered enops’ son, while polydamas stuck prothoënor.
he bragged about it, but telamonian ajax lobbed his spear back,
and it nailed archelocus—anténor’s kid—straight in the neck, messing him up.
ajax flexed on polydamas like, “how ‘bout that trade kill, bruh?” trojans took that l to heart.

then akamas whacked boeotian promachus, dissing the greeks for being all talk.
this pissed off peneleos, who came for akamas, but found ilioneus, forband’s precious only son,
jammed a spear right under the eyebrow, the point punching through the back of his skull.
dude dropped to his knees, and peneleos whipped out his sword, slicing the neck clean.
the trojan’s head rolled off with the helm still on, spear stuck in his eye.
peneleos basically said, “hey, trojans, you can tell his folks to cry it out at home,
just like promachus’s wife is about to do—she ain’t seeing her man come back.”

everyone got the chills at that savage scene.

muses on olympus, tell me who took the first spoils once poseidon boosted the achaean mojo.
first up was telamonian ajax dropping hyrtius the mysian. antilochus ended falces and mermerus,
meriones put down morus and hippotion, teucer ended prothoön and periphetes,
then agamemnon destroyed hyperenor, letting the spear tear through his guts so his soul fled out his wound.
but the most kills fell to little ajax (oïlean), who pinned fleeing trojans one after another—
since he was the fastest foot-chaser in that entire meltdown once zeus had them in panic mode.

and that’s how hera’s big distraction let poseidon vibe with the achaean homies,
and the trojans felt the sting big time, for real.
