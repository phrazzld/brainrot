yooo, listen up: once both squads lined up nice with their shot-callers,

the trojans stormed out shrieking and whooping, no joke, like a savage flock of cranes

screaming in the sky when they bounce winter’s downpour,

hightailing it toward those ocean currents,

ready to square up with the tiny pygmy dudes—fr bringing carnage vibes.

the crane squad swoops in the mist, seeking that petty beef,

but our achaean homies? they marched in dead silence, hearts blasting with fury,

all day pumped to body-block each other from extinction.

it was kinda like when a south wind dumps a thick fog

over a mountain’s summit, suuuuper cursed for shepherds, but a W for thieves,

because you can barely see as far as a rock toss through that haze:

that’s the vibe under their feet: a swirling dustcloud rising

as they hustled across the plain fast af.

then, just as they got right up close, basically face to face,

prince paris, the hottie trojan frontman, flexed for the trojans

with a dope leopard-print pelt on his shoulders, curved bow in hand,

plus his sword, and two bronze-tipped spears. man was brandishing those

like “yo, who’s the top dog among you argives? lemme see if you can fade me

mono-e-mono in this savage war zone.”

when menelaus (the war-crush of ares) peeped him stepping bold from the trojan masses,

his strides all long and cocky, menelaus lit up like a ravenous lion

who stumbles on a big tasty carcass—maybe some horned deer or wild goat—

and goes wild munching, even if the pack of swift hounds or beefy dudes

chase him.

that’s how hyped menelaus got, spotting paris the godlike thirst trap

and thinking “bet, i’m about to make that clown pay.”

he hopped off his chariot, armor clanking, ready for the kill.

soon as paris spotted him in the front lines, menelaus vibing with pure vengeance,

paris’s heart legit seized up. man did an insta-reverse, scuttling back into his squad to dodge doom.

like someone who sees a snake in the hillside undergrowth and leaps back,

legs trembling, face turning pale as chalk—

that was paris as he ghosted back among the trojan elite,

shook by atreus’s kid, the war-lord menelaus.

hector was like “bro, are you for real right now?” and came at him spitting venom:

“you tragic pretty-boy, cursed womanizer, absolute slick liar,

why couldn’t you have been unborn or died single, for real.

honestly i wish that. it’d be a hella better outcome

than watching you degrade us all while haters side-eye us.

the long-haired achaeans are for sure LOLing right now,

thinking you’re our top champion just ‘cause you got that face

but zero grit, zero nerve to back it up.

this is that same energy that had you sailing on those wave-riding ships,

rolling out with your homies to snag that hottie from a foreign land—

someone’s daughter-in-law of real spearmen—

and you dragged her home, bringing your dad massive humiliation, the city too, the entire people,

and giving our enemies a reason to cheer, while you soak in shame?

and even now, can’t you step up to menelaus, the war-lord?

then you’d finally figure out the kind of dude whose wifey you keep snatching.

spoiler: your harp, your gifts from aphrodite,

your luscious hair, your golden glow—none of that’s gonna save your hide when you face the dust.”

hector hammered him with that savage scolding, then added:

“the trojans are cowards for even letting you keep breathing, or else you’d be stoned to the max for all this trouble you caused.”

paris, the godlike pretty boy, clapped back:

“hector, man, you’re spitting truth, not even gonna front.

your heart’s basically an unbreakable axe that carves through timber under a master carpenter’s hand, never giving up. that’s your vibe:

fearless, no chill. so don’t rag on me for getting dope gifts from golden aphrodite.

nobody just tosses away a goddess’s present, and i sure ain’t picking them off the shelf myself.

anyway, if you want me to scrap with menelaus,

tell the trojans to sit down, same for the achaeans,

then put me and menelaus in the middle, one-on-one, to throw hands for helen and all her loot.

whoever wins flexes and takes it all home—woman and the goods.

everyone else can vow to each other to keep it peaceful

and let the trojans keep living in their fertile city, while the greeks bounce

back to horse-rearing argos, land of lit ladies.”

he said it, and hector was feeling that bigtime,

so he strolled into the thick of trojans, holding his spear by the middle to wave them off,

and they froze in place.

but the long-haired achaean archers took aim at him, slinging arrows and stones,

till lord agamemnon roared:

“hold up, argives! stop! you guys gotta chill. the bright-helmeted hector wants to talk.”

everyone paused, dropping silent,

in that eager hush. hector stood between both armies

and shouted: “trojans and glossy-greaved achaeans, listen:

this is paris’s proposition, the dude who started all this drama.

he says let both sides lay down arms on the open field,

while he and menelaus throw down alone over helen and her haul.

whoever wins gets the whole package, the girl and her stuff.

then the rest of us swear peace and do the friend thing.”

he stopped talking, and the crowd went absolutely hush

till menelaus, that big-voiced boss, spoke up:

“hear me out: i’m the one who’s been hurting the most in all this,

so i’m down for the trojans and greeks to call it quits finally.

we’ve all suffered so much over my beef with paris.

whichever of us is fated to die, let him die, so the rest can part ways quickly.

bring two sheep—one white, one black—for earth and the sun.

and we’ll bring another for zeus. also, fetch big daddy priam

so he can vow the oath personally—since his sons are shady as heck

and might break that vow if it’s just them. you know how reckless the younger crowd can be.

an old man sees forward and backward, wants the best for everyone.”

he spoke, and both trojans and achaean homies got stoked,

hoping this war might finally chill.

they reined in their horses along the ranks, hopped off,

peeled off their armor, piling it all close on the ground,

just a slim strip of field between them. meanwhile hector

sent two heralds running to the city to fetch the sheep and call on priam,

and lord agamemnon shipped off talthybius

to the curved ships, telling him to bring a sacrificial lamb. dude obeyed, no questions asked.

then iris soared to helen, that glow-up queen with the white arms,

disguised as laodice, wife of helikaon, antenor’s son,

the prettiest daughter of priam.

she found helen in the hall, weaving a huge purple cloth,

embroidering battles between horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans,

all the heartbreak they faced for her sake. iris got close

and whispered quick: “hey bestie, come watch the showdown.

the trojans and achaeans used to be going savage on each other,

but now they’re silent, leaning on their shields, spears jammed in the ground.

paris and menelaus are about to swordfight over you.

whoever wins, that’s your next hubby. so you might wanna see.”

the goddess’s words spiked helen’s soul with nostalgia

for her old man, her city, her parents. she tossed a bright shawl over her

and hurried out, tears in her eyes, with two attendants at her side.

they made their way to the scaean gates, where the trojan elders posted up:

priam, panthoos, thymoites, lampus, clytios,

hiketaon, plus wise old men like oukalegon and antenor,

resting from war but still boss at speaking, perched like crickets

in a tree dropping their sweet chirps. that was the trojan leadership squad.

once they saw helen approaching the tower,

they muttered: “damn, no wonder we’ve endured so many L’s for so long

for a woman like that. she’s basically immortal-level gorgeous.

still, might be best if she left, so we don’t all get doomed.”

priam called helen over with a friendly wave: “come here, daughter,

sit next to me so you can see your old husband, your folks.

this war’s not on you but on the gods who cursed us.

still, tell me: who’s that giant achaean boss over there,

tall and regal? i’ve seen bigger dudes, but none so majestic. he legit looks like a king.”

and helen, bright among women, answered: “you’re so sweet, father-in-law,

i wish i’d died before coming here with your son, leaving family behind.

but i can’t fix it now, i just cry.

the dude you asked about is wide-ruling agamemnon, child of atreus:

he’s a strong king, a real savage with a spear, and my ex-brother-in-law

if i can even call it that.”

the old man was awed: “wow, blessed atreus kid, moira-born,

you have an army of youths under your sway.

i once visited phrygia’s fabulous vines, saw a flood of horsemen under otrês and mygdon,

camped at the sangarios banks, the day those amazons rolled up.

but they were fewer than these bright-eyed achaeans.”

then spotting odysseus, the wise one, the old man asked:

“and who’s that smaller than agamemnon but broader in chest?

his gear’s on the ground, he’s striding the ranks like a ram in a white flock?”

helen, daughter of zeus, responded:

“that’s odysseus, laertes’ boy, island-bred in rocky ithaca,

master of cunning plots and thick-woven tricks.”

antênor chimed in, the wise trojan:

“girl, you’re speaking facts. i remember when odysseus came here with menelaus,

on that mission about you. i hosted them at my place,

saw their looks and heard their cunning words. menelaus spoke quick, smooth, not many words but crystal,

since he’s younger. but odysseus just stood, looking down, not even waving his staff,

like some clueless lump. but once he opened his mouth, oh man,

words poured like winter snow and nobody could match that flow.”

then the old man noticed ajax:

“so who’s that super tall achaean, a total unit with broad shoulders?”

helen with the long robes answered:

“that’s ajax, bulwark of the greeks, unstoppable. next to him is idomeneus, shining among cretans,

and the cretan captains ring him like a god.

often menelaus hosted him back in sparta

whenever he came from crete. i see all the other curly-haired achaeans i know, can name them,

but castor the horse-tamer and boxer polydueces, my own brothers,

i can’t spot them. maybe they missed the boat,

or they did come but won’t step into the fight ‘cause of the shame i caused.”

little did she know they’d already been swallowed by mother earth

back home in lacedaemon, in their fatherland.

the heralds brought the holy oath-stuff—two lambs, a goatskin of wine,

a shining bowl, golden cups, and old man priam

got the prompt: “rise up, laomedon’s son, the best trojans and bronze-clad achaeans

want you in the field to cut deals. paris and menelaus are about to duel for the woman;

whoever wins gets the wife and her haul; the rest vow friendship and peace.”

that was the message. priam shuddered, told his homies to harness up the horses, and they obeyed quick.

he hopped in his chariot, pulling back the reins, with antenor at his side,

and the horses trotted through the scaean gates down to the plain.

when they reached the lines of trojans and greeks,

they stepped off onto the Earth. in the middle, alongside big achaeans, came

lord agamemnon and cunning odysseus, while heralds

gathered the oath-offerings. they mixed wine in the bowl, poured water on the kings’ hands.

agamemnon drew his knife from the sheath at his side,

cut hair from the lamb heads, and the heralds passed it around

to trojan and achaean lords. then the king raised his arms and prayed:

“father zeus on ida, top-tier deity,

and you, sun, who sees and hears all,

and you rivers, and earth, and those underworld watchers of men who break vows,

be witnesses: if paris kills menelaus,

he keeps helen and all her gear, and we sail home.

if blond menelaus kills paris, trojans must hand over helen and the loot,

and pay the tribute that’s just, for future times to recall.

but if priam and his sons won’t cough it up

after paris goes down, i’ll stay and fight until i see the war ended.”

he said, then slit the lambs’ throats with ruthless bronze,

laying them on the ground, their little limbs flailing,

the blade draining their life. they dipped wine from the bowl in cups, praying to the eternal gods,

each side chanting, “zeus, do your worst to the side that breaks this vow,

pour out their brains like wine, let their kids and wives be enslaved.”

but cronion wasn’t about to bless that vow just yet.

priam, the dardanian king, piped up:

“trojans and bright-greaved achaeans, i’m heading back to windy ilion—

i can’t bear to watch my kid fight menelaus. only zeus and the immortals

know who’s fated to die.”

he set the lambs in the chariot, hopped in,

and antenor took the reins. they rolled back to troy.

hector (priam’s son) and odysseus measured a spot, then threw lots in a bronze helmet,

to see who’d fling their spear first. both sides prayed, arms lifted:

“zeus on ida, great and glorious,

whoever started this beef, drop them in hades so we can be bros again.”

hector gave the helmet a quick spin, eyes turned away, and out popped paris’s lot.

the troops lined up, next to their tall horses and bright gear,

while radiant paris geared up in flawless armor—

first the greaves, with silver ankle clips, then his bro lycaon’s breastplate,

which fit him perfect. hung a silver-studded sword

and hefted a big sturdy shield, strapped on a fancy helmet crest that bobbed ominously,

then grabbed a tough spear. menelaus did likewise.

when they stood alone in the open, between trojans and greeks,

everyone stared in awe as they brandished spears in white-knuckled rage.

paris let fly first, launching his long-shadowed spear,

clanging on menelaus’s equal-coverage shield but failing to break through: the point bent,

so menelaus prayed to father zeus and answered with his own cast:

“zeus, let me wreck this clown who wronged me, let him taste these hands,

so even future folks will shiver at the thought

of betraying a host who gave them friendship.”

he hurled the spear, smashing through paris’s bright shield and elaborate breastplate,

ripping the shirt by his flank, but paris twisted aside from the fatal blow.

menelaus whipped out his silver-studded sword, swung at the helmet,

but the sword shattered in three or four pieces.

the king cursed to the sky:

“zeus, you’re savage! i thought i’d get justice on paris, but my sword just ghosted, and my spear’s thrown for nothing, didn’t even land?”

roaring, he lunged for paris’s horsehair crest,

dragging him toward the achaean ranks with the strap under his chin. that might’ve ended paris on the spot

but aphrodite noticed, snapped the strap,

letting the helmet dangle in menelaus’s hands while the hero flung it to his buddies.

then menelaus lunged again with a bronze spear thirsting for the kill,

but aphrodite whisked paris away in a swirl of mist,

setting him gently in his sweetly-scented bedroom.

she ran for helen on the tall tower, flicking her fragrant robe,

looking like some old lady weaving wool in sparta,

someone helen adored. aphrodite cooed:

“girl, come with me. paris is calling, posted up in the bedroom like a total mood,

glowing with fresh fits. you’d never guess he was just in a fight—

dude looks like he strolled out of a dance party.”

that rattled helen’s heart. she recognized the goddess’s divine neck, shiny chest, blazing eyes,

and snapped: “witchy goddess, why you trying to hustle me again?

you gonna drag me to some other city with well-kept walls,

if you got more mortal sweethearts there?

paris lost, he wants to haul me back, that’s it? you’re here for that?

you sit with him, you be his queen or his slave, i’m done.

i can’t keep dragging my shame around while all troy’s women drag me in their groupchats.”

aphrodite fired back, raging:

“watch yourself, mortal. i can drop you real quick.

you were my fave, but i can make you my enemy, get both trojans and greeks hating you

till you’re swallowed by a dismal fate.”

helen froze at that threat, trembling,

threw the shining cloth around her and slipped away unseen, goddess leading the way.

the servants got back to their tasks while helen headed to the high-roof bedroom.

aphrodite brought her a seat in front of paris, and helen sat,

averting her gaze, then blasted him:

“so you came back from the fight, huh? i wish menelaus had ended you out there,

my old husband had that real strength. you used to brag about how you’d whoop him with your spear:

why not call him out again? i dare you. but tbh, do yourself a favor

and don’t push that. you might just die.”

paris answered:

“babe, don’t bully me with harsh words. menelaus got the win this round with athena’s help,

but next time i’ll clap him. i got my own gods behind me.

anyway, let’s forget that and get horizontal.

not gonna lie, i’m thirstier for you now than when i snatched you from sparta

and we first hooked up on that island cranae. i’m on fire right now.”

and he led her straight to bed, she followed him into those inlaid sheets.

while those two got cozy, menelaus prowled the lines like a predator,

seeking any trojan who might point him to paris.

nobody’d help though, ‘cause they hated paris too. man was universally canceled.

agamemnon raised his voice:

“trojans, dardanians, and allies, listen up: menelaus is the rightful victor.

hand over helen and her stash, pay the tribute that’s due,

so this stands as a lesson for future generations.”

the achaeans all nodded in agreement.
