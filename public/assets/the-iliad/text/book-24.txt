so while the trojans wept inside their walls, grieving hector,
swift-footed achilles kept dragging that poor corpse around patroclus’s tomb by dawn,
still raging like a storm that wouldn’t die.

pat’s funeral done, but achilles refused to chill,
tying hector’s body behind his chariot each sunrise, circling in the dusty air,
though the gods protected hector’s flesh so it never ripped or stank—
apollo especially showered him in ambrosial magic, shielding from the sun’s harsh burn.

the gods on olympus debated: was it right for achilles to savage a corpse like that?
some said “nah,” wanting hermes to snatch it away stealth.
but hera, poseidon, and athena kept a grudge, still pissed at paris for that apple fiasco.
zeus finally stepped in: “enough. apollo’s right. hector honored me, big sacrifices.

let’s talk to thetis, have her calm achilles, accept a ransom, release hector.
then i’ll send iris to priam, so the old man can personally beg for the body.”

bam—iris soared into the sea’s depths, found thetis and her mermaid squad,
tears rolling for her unstoppable yet doomed son. iris: “yo girl, zeus calls for you.”
thetis rose to olympus, draped in a dark cloak, sat before thunder-lord zeus,
who gently said: “silver-foot goddess, go speak to achilles, he’s got to let go.

he’s hoarding hector’s corpse, fueling the godly drama. it’s time to relent,
trade the body for major trojan loot.”

thetis sped to achilles’s tent. found him alone, still refusing normal life,
hugging patroclus’s memory. she spoke soft: “son, how long you gonna mope?
you can’t keep punishing a corpse. the gods are pissed.
release it for a sweet ransom, father zeus commands it.”

achilles sighed: “fine. let them bring gold. i’ll do as zeus says.”

zeus then dispatched iris again, rolling to priam’s palace,
where the old king lay, hugging the dirt in agony. iris whispered:
“priam, man up. gather epic treasure in a cart, roll out with a herald,
no trojan escort—just you. zeus will send hermes to guide you
so you can buy back hector from achilles. savage mission, but it’s your shot.”

priam rose, barked at his sons: “get me a fancy cart, pack it with gold,
fine robes, shining tripods, extra just in case—i need everything top-tier.
the city is undone, but i’ll try to bring my boy home.”

they loaded the wagon with twelve robes, bright cloaks, hammered gold, a monstrous cauldron,
and a gem-studded cup. priam prayed for a sign. an eagle soared overhead—zeus’s green light.
he sped off, trembling, but determined, a single herald in tow.

zeus told hermes: “yo, guide him stealthily. mortals might jump him otherwise.”
hermes strapped on the golden sneaks, took his wand, zipped down, looking like some squire,
met priam by the river in the starry night. “old man, whatchu doin’ sneaking here with loot?
fear not, i got you. i’m from achilles’s clan, i’ll pave the way.”

priam sensed the divine vibe, gave thanks. hermes hopped on the cart, parted the watchers,
put all to sleep, whipped the mules, slid them through the achaean gate,
and at achilles’s camp, he said, “i’m out—facing me would be awkward.
go kneel at his feet, talk fatherly sorrow, that’s your best bet.”

priam entered, found achilles at supper with buddies.
everyone froze as the old king clasped achilles’s knees, kissed those lethal hands that killed so many sons.
the entire tent gawked, jaws slack. priam sobbed: “achilles, think of your own dad, how he’d feel losing you.
i’m forced to kiss the hands that slew my child. i beg you, accept this ransom, let me bury hector.”

achilles felt that heartbreak wave. he wept for his father, for patroclus, tears flooding the tent,
priam drowning in his sorrow, two men locked in cosmic grief.
achilles finally spoke: “the gods weave sorrow into mortal life, no escape.
my father’s back home, i might never see him, your city’s undone. let’s try peace.

take your boy’s corpse. i’ll cut you a deal. i’d give you funeral time.
but don’t test my rage, old man, i’m on thin ice.”

he raised priam gently, they gazed at each other, hearts bruised.
achilles barked: “maids, prep hector’s body, wash it discreetly, so priam won’t freak at the gore.”
they did so, anointing it in oils, wrapping it in a fine cloak,
achilles lifted it to the cart himself, prayed to patroclus: “forgive me, bro, i’m letting hector go.
the trojans brought insane gifts, i’ll share with you in spirit.”

priam eyed the massive trove, achilles nodded, “nah, not now, let’s eat.
even niobe, who lost twelve kids, eventually ate. sorrow’s unstoppable, but hunger’s real.
you gotta keep living. then you can sleep in the porch, i can’t risk the greeks seeing you here.
tomorrow you bounce with your boy.”

they dined, priam marveling at achilles’s epic glow,
achilles marveling at priam’s regal grit. after a while, priam sighed, “let me rest.
i’ve not slept since you took hector out. i’m old, i can’t keep going on fumes.”

achilles arranged bedding outside, ensuring the privacy.
but hermes, still watching, woke priam in the night: “we gotta go now, old man, while it’s still dark.
the rest might find you at dawn and steal your loot.”
priam jumped up, yoked the mules, quietly stole away, carrying precious hector, guided by hermes unseen.

at troy, cassandra spotted them from the high tower, shrieking:
“look, father’s back with hector’s body!”
the entire city rushed out, led by hecuba and andromache, wailing so loud it shook the gates.
they placed hector on a carved bed, the mourning wave unstoppable.

andromache clung to his head, sobbing how their baby is fatherless, the city’s defenses gone.
hecuba wailed about how hector was her pride, and not even death made him look lesser.
helen sobbed how hector was the only trojan who treated her kindly, never blaming her for the war.
the entire trojan mass wept in unison, grief on every face.

for nine days they gathered wood, obeying priam’s call. on the tenth, they lifted hector, burned him on the pyre.
the next dawn, they doused the coals with bright wine, collected his white bones in a golden casket,
wrapped them in purple cloth, set them in a tomb hollow, heaped a mound of stones.
thus they finished, then feasted in sorrow at king priam’s hall.

so ended the epic funeral of hector, breaker of horses.
