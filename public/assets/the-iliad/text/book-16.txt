so the trojan squad and the achaian homies were brawling savagely around the dope-beaked ships,
when patrokles rolled up on achilles—the real shepherd of armies—
with hot tears rolling down like a dark-spring waterfall sliding down a cliff.
swift-footed achilles looked over, saw pat’s cheeks streaming, and was like,
“bro, why you weeping like you just got grounded from your phone?
you good? something happen to our boys back home?
my dad peleus is still vibing, your pops menoitios still breathing, so what's good?
or is this about the argives getting hammered out on the shore 'cause of their own messed-up pride?”

patrokles, groaning like some poor soul who forgot to back up his phone, spat out:
“achilles, man, don't come at me like that. the achaeans are literally getting farmed out there.
all our besties are laid out in the sand with arrows in their thighs or spears in their bellies:
diomedes with the heavy spear arm, odysseus the cunning, big king agamemnon,
even eurypylos—everyone’s benched. the healers run around with potions,
but there's no vibe because you just won't budge. that unstoppable rage you keep
is messing with the entire timeline. c’mon, at least let me take our myrmidon crew,
let me rally them and maybe be a glimmer of hope for the argives.
hand me your iconic gear, so maybe the trojans see me and think i’m you,
and back off enough for the achaeans to catch a breath. i swear, they’re drowning in sweat and blood.”

my guy pat had no clue he was basically signing up for a bad date with death.
achilles, rolling his eyes with big-time vexation, replied:
“pat, it’s not that i’m out here ignoring omens or anything—
i’m just raging about how that clown agamemnon dissed me,
yoinking my prize-girl as if i was some worthless rando.
but fine, i told everyone i’d chill in my tent till the trojans come torch my own ships.
apparently, that hour’s come around. so get geared in my sweet armor,
take the myrmidons, throw hands with these trojans who pressed us all the way to the hulls.
they’re hype only because they don’t see me out there. i promise, they'd scramble
if i was bossing the battlefield. but you—once you push them back from the ships,
don’t go flexing beyond measure, racing them to troy.
apollo’s got them on retainer, and i don’t want him handing you an early l.
secure your big glory, then come right back, so they can give me proper respect and gifts.
bro, i wish all trojans and all achaeans would just vanish, so me and you
could tear down troy alone. but for real, keep your head in the game.”

so pat nodded. the dude was thirsty for that kill streak.
achilles whistled for the myrmidons, who swarmed in like savage wolves—
blood still on their muzzles from devouring a mountain stag,
panting, hearts blazing, unstoppable. they gathered around achilles,
the swift-limbed boss, who barked orders for them to kit up:
fifty ships he commanded, each holding squads of men,
and he set up five leaders to help him keep them organized.

then patrokles locked on those greaves with silver clasps,
buckled achilles’s fancy chest piece across his own heart,
slung the sword with silver nails, hefted the massive shield,
and donned the horsehair-crested helm that radiated intimidation.
but he left behind that legendary pelian spear—only achilles had the muscle
to fling that trunk of ash gifted by the old centaur chiron.

automedon harnessed the immortal horses xanthos and balios,
who soared on the wind—prize beasts mothered by a harpy with the west wind—
plus the mortal war-steed pedasos, snatched when achilles sacked a city.

achilles went to his chest, fetched a special cup from the stash—
nobody else ever drank from it; he only used it to pour wine for daddy zeus.
he cleansed it, rinsed his hands, poured shining wine,
lifted his gaze to the sky, and prayed:
“zeus, old boss of dodona, if ever you heard me before,
hear me again. i’m sending patrokles out to fight with my gear—
please give him some insane clout so he can protect the ships,
then send him home safe, gear and all.”
zeus heard the prayer halfway: he’d let pat push back the trojans,
but wouldn't promise a safe return.

the myrmidons poured out of the tents like wasps from their roadside nests—
buzzing with fury if some kid kicked it for the lolz.
pat hollered: “myrmidons, you savage bros of achilles,
don’t forget your trash talk about how you’d stomp trojans if achilles ever let you fight.
well, guess what? time to pop off, prove you got that dog in you.”

they charged the trojans, who freaked at the sight of achilles’s armor,
guessing the swift one had ditched the beef and was back.
patrokles slammed into the biggest cluster by the ships,
speared pyraichmes, the payon leader, dropping him on the spot.
the trojans felt their courage melt; they flailed away from the ships’ blaze.
the achaeans roared, rushing forward, stamping out the Trojan fire.

like a thick storm cloud peeled back by a lightning-charged sky,
the achaeans saw daylight, but the trojans didn't break completely.
they grudgingly gave ground. pat worked the front lines,
stabbing men left and right—shock and awe.
menelaos, big ajax, and others also took kills.
blood was spilt in buckets.

then big sarrpy—king sarpedon, zeus’s own kid, leading his lykians—
saw his entourage getting hammered by pat’s spear.
he shouted, “where y’all going, lykian homies? respect yourselves. watch me engage this savage.”
they squared off. pat caught the horse in the shoulder, it collapsed, tangling the lines.
automedon hopped off and sliced the trace to free up the pair,
so they could keep driving forward. pat finally found his window,
drove a spear through sarpedon’s chest where the breath sits.
the mighty king fell like a tall pine crashed by a lumberjack’s blade—
dust in his mouth, he howled for glaukos to keep him from rotting in shame.

zeus looked down from olympus, heart heavy for his son,
dripped down bloody raindrops in honor.
he told apollo to preserve the body, whisk it away so the lykians could bury him right.

pat kept blazing, gunning for more.
he could’ve stormed the city, ended the war, if apollo—
that unstoppable backstage pass—hadn’t stepped in.
three times pat tried to scale the trojan wall, thrice apollo shoved him off,
whispering, “back off, pat. this city ain’t for you to take.”
pat stumbled back, disoriented.

hector hung by the skaian gates, not sure if he should keep pushing or regroup.
apollo slid up next to him, disguised as his uncle,
and hissed, “yo, why you chilling? go after that pat dude!”
hector hopped down with a growl, told cebriones to drive the horses in.
the trojans parted, hector beelined for pat.

our boy pat jumped from the chariot too, a smooth stone in hand,
and beamed cebriones right in the face,
knocking eyeballs out onto the dust—like an acrobat flailing off a fancy cart.
pat teased, “damn, this dude can do flips. maybe he should join the circuses.”
he lunged like a lion pouncing on a fresh kill.
hector leaped from the other side, both scrapping over cebriones’s corpse.

the fight raged around them—shields bashed shields, spears flew, men shrieked.
finally, the trojans reeled, the achaeans turned savage,
and pat unleashed one last triple kill—charging like a rabid hawk.
but the fourth time he tried to surge forward, apollo slapped him from behind,
knocking the helmet off so it rattled under the horses’ hooves.
that precious crest, once unsoiled, was now dusty.
the strap on his breastplate snapped. panic tore through pat’s guts.
then euphorbus—a trojan who was a total beast at speed and spear—
stabbed pat’s back. pat spun, wincing. euphorbus slunk away, shook.

hector, seizing the chance, closed in, speared pat in the gut.
pat crashed like a felled bull, dust in his mouth.
hector jeered, “so you thought you’d wreck our city, enslave our wives? no shot.
achilles couldn't save you, even though i’m sure he told you to watch out for me.
now watch the vultures munch your corpse.”

barely breathing, pat retorted, “bro, you got me only cuz apollo and euphorbus tagged me first.
if i fought you 1v1, you’d be canceled. also, spoiler: achilles will do you dirty soon.”
then pat’s soul drifted away, moaning for his lost prime.

hector stepped on him and yanked the spear free.
the trojan lines parted around him, chasing automedon,
while pat’s body lay there, prophecy in his last breath—
that soon, swift achilles would avenge him.
