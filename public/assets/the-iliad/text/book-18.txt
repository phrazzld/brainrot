thus they were throwin’ hands out in the open like a freakin’ wildfire,

and antilochus (that swift-leg runner boi) sprinted to achilles.
he pulled up right outside those pointy-prowed ships,
where achilles was just posted, heavy thoughts weighin’ on his chest—
my dude was real torn up, spittin’ at his big ol’ heart:
“ugh, for real? why my homies out here wiggin’ by the ships,
scattering all over the plains like headless chickens?
please tell me the gods ain’t serving me fresh heartbreak
the way my mom once spilled the tea: that the best of the myrmidons,
still alive while i breathe, might catch that final fade from trojans.
could it be menoitios’s boy—oh savage pat—croaked out there?
he wasn’t s’posed to push so far, i told him just to kill that fire
then bounce on back. zero reason to press hektor, big-lion hektor.”

and as he ranted inside his own mind, there came antilochus,
son of nestor, drippin’ tears, bringin’ the worst news:
“buddy achilles, i hate to be that guy with the tragic tea,
but pat’s gone. the trojans are out here scrappin’ around his naked corpse.
hektor snatched the gear off him, that helmet plumed in glory, yeah he took it.”

and with that, a dark vibe ate at achilles’s chest:
he scooped up dust in both hands, caked it on his head,
wrecking that pretty face. all the black ash spread
on that fresh tunic, and he collapsed in the dirt, real dramatic,
pulling at his hair, losing it. the slave girls that achilles and pat
had sacked from foreign lands started shriekin’, runnin’ out the door
to gather ‘round that fearless king, all beatin’ their chests, knees gone weak.
antilochus cried on the sideline, holdin’ achilles’s hands
while achilles roared with heartbreak, fearin’ the man might just
slice his own throat in the madness. that bellow

carried across the salty deep to his goddess mom, who sat
beside the old sea father. she heard and let out a wail,
and all the nereid squad, every sea-nymph down in the brine,
circled round: glaukē, thaleia, and kymodoke, plus
many more whose names ring out like obscure tiktoks in the tide.
the silver cave filled with their moans, the goddess themis
leading that sorrow chorus. “listen up, my sisters,” she sobbed,
“feel my pain, hear how wrecked my heart is.

damn me for bearing a kid so epic, so unstoppable,
only for him to watch his bros die one by one and suffer
no end of grief. i told him: ‘achilles, baby, go be a hero, but watch
how short that path is.’ now pat’s down, and i can’t even help.”
so she darted out, that silver-footed mama, with the nymphs in tow,
the sea swell bursting behind them. once they got near troy,

they hopped ashore, marched over to where the myrmidon ships
clustered tight ‘round achilles. they found him
groaning heavy, and she grabbed him, howlin’
“child, why you sobbin’? what’s up with all this heartbreak?
speak, don’t hide it: didn’t zeus do you a solid, punishing

all the achaeans like you asked? wasn’t that your big prayer
when you raised your hands, wanting them to realize
they can’t do squat without you?”

then swift achilles answered through the tears:
“sure mom, zeus answered my petty beef. but who cares?
patroklos, my main day-one, is gone—like GONE. i valued him

like my own damn life, and now he’s dead and looted by hektor.
and those sweet shiny arms the gods once gave my dad,
that day you got forced into mortal marriage— they’re gone, too.
damn, if only you’d stayed under the waves with the immortal fam

and let peleus marry some mortal chick instead.
you wouldn’t be weepin’ your heart out now that your son’s gotta follow pat
into the grave soon, cause i ain’t here to see old age, either.
i won’t stay alive if i can’t drop hektor first, pay him back

for making pat’s body his trophy.” the goddess answered him sobbing:
“you’re doomed to an early exit, my sweet boy, soon after hektor you fall.”
achilles, scowling: “fine! i’d rather die right now

than fail to shield my bro in that final moment.
he died so far from home, robbed of me, his shield.
and i was just rotting by these ships, worthless. no home, no help.
rage devoured me, that sticky dust in my chest.

but let’s bury that old drama; you can’t unscramble eggs.
i gotta hunt hektor now, that menacing slayer, even if it kills me.
death’ll come anyway— no big. not even hercules
got away from the fates. so i’d best chase that w

while i can, smash trojans, make ‘em regret
this brief calm they had. don’t try to stop me, ma. i gotta do this.”

and the silver-foot goddess shot back, tears fresh:
“okay baby, i get it, i won’t hold you back from avengin’ your man.
but you ain’t got gear: hektor’s out flexing in your hot armor, all stolen.

he won’t brag for long, though— doom’s comin’ for him.
just wait ‘til i snag you some fresh fits from hephaistos.
come sunrise, i’m on olympus, talkin’ with the forge-lord. he’ll hook you up

with brand-new drip. you hold off the fight a sec, trust.”

then she turned to her sea-sisters: “y’all go back, see father ocean
and spill this tea. i gotta climb olympus, see if the man of fire
will craft some unstoppable gear for my boy.”

they dove back beneath the tides while the goddess soared
to shining olympus with quicksilver grace.

the achaeans, meanwhile, fled the battlefield, yelling in terror
from man-killin’ hektor. they clung to their ships by the roarin’ sea
but still couldn’t rescue patroklos from the arrows alone—
’cause the trojans and hektor, that unstoppable son of priam,

kept forcing a fight around pat’s body. three times
mighty hektor grabbed the dead hero’s feet, trying to drag him off
while the two ajaxes battered him away. he wouldn’t quit.
like a savage lion starvin’ in the grass, he slunk back in, roarin’,

and they hammered him back. he’d leap forward, roar again, repeat.

like stray shepherds can’t chase off a raging lion from the sheep,
so them ajaxes struggled to keep hektor from pat’s corpse.
he might’ve stolen that glory if wind-footed iris

hadn’t bolted from olympus to tell achilles: “gear up, big dog,
secret mission from hera—zeus don’t know, none of the gods do.
hektor’s about to haul pat’s body to breezy ilion,

stick that head on a spike if he can. don’t let it happen.”

achilles answered: “iris, goddess, how am i supposed to gear up?
hektor took my armor, and mama won’t let me suit up
’till she gets me new smith-work from hephaistos. i got no backup gear

except maybe that giant shield ajax has, but i guess he’s busy
swingin’ steel for pat.”

iris said, “facts, but just show up. let them see you.
the trojans might panic, the achaeans might breathe,
and that small break might save your people.” and with that, she left.

achilles jumped up, and athena placed her tasseled aegis
over his heroic shoulders, crowned him with a golden cloud
that spit shining flames. like a smoke pillar from some besieged city

begging for help— that bright blaze soared from his head.
he strode to the ditch but didn’t join the achaeans, obeying ma’s words.

he roared, and pallas amplified that shout
so loud it spooked the trojans. it was ear-splitting as a war horn.
chariots swerved, drivers froze, spooked by the flames dancing

above achilles’s skull. thrice the warrior roared, thrice chaos
shook the trojan line, and in that meltdown, a dozen
top-tier trojan fighters crashed in the dust, done.

the greeks were stoked to haul pat from the arrow-storm
and lay him gently on a bed of sorrow. swift achilles
trailed behind, weeping big tears,

looking at his faithful friend, gashed by sharp bronze,
sent off in full gear and never to return.

unwilling, the sun sank in the ocean at hera’s push,
and the achaeans took a break from their brutal grind.
the trojans also peeled back, unhitched their horses,

and huddled in council, but nobody dared sit down:
achilles was back— the boogeyman they’d tried to forget.
polydamas, the wise boi of panthous, best at seeing forward-backward,

rolled up to hector as friend and rival in counsel:
“look, let’s not front: we gotta go back inside the walls.
this mania was chill while achilles was mia,

but now he’s raging, we can’t handle him in open field.
he’ll slam us right up to our gates, and then it’s curtains.
my hot take: let’s bounce to the city. night’s on our side now.

tomorrow, he might roll up, but we can hold from the towers.
that savage war-lord might burn out, or run short on time.”

but plumed hector glared: “you talkin’ ‘bout hiding in the city again?
we ain’t done that enough? we used to be so loaded with gold,

we were the richest out there, but ever since zeus turned on us
we’re pawnin’ all our goods, shipping them away. now, the big man

finally gave me the chance to push the achaeans to their ships,
don’t kill the vibe with your doomer talk. no trojan here

is gonna follow you. we stay in the field, we keep that edge.
tonight we feast, we keep watch. tomorrow we move in for the kill.

if swift achilles steps up, so be it— maybe i carve him up,
or he does me. war is a shared meal— you either eat or get eaten.”

so hektor spoke, and the trojans cheered, ignoring polydamas’s real wisdom.
they parted for dinner, while the achaeans spent the whole night

wailing over patroklos. right at the center, achilles
led the grieving like a lion parted from its cubs,

pacing around, roaring to the myrmidons:
“damn, i remember blowin’ big talk, telling menoitios i’d bring his son home

once we’d sacked troy and scored that sweet loot.
but zeus had other plans: both pat and i are fated

to lie here in the dust of troy. i won’t see my own father or mother
back in phthia. now, since pat left before me to hades,

i swear i won’t bury you until i bring hektor’s gear
and sever his head to place on your pyre. plus

i’ll sacrifice twelve trojan kids in your honor
’cause i am big mad. ‘til then, you’ll lie by the ships

while trojan ladies cry over you day and night—
the ones we took by force, yeah, they’ll weep for real.”

then he told his crew: “set up a tripod, heat some water,
we gotta wash the blood off pat.” so they hoisted the metal pot

and lit the flame. once it boiled, they cleansed him, oiled him up,
closed his wounds with healing balm,

laid him on a bed, and covered him in linens, draping a white shroud.

all night the myrmidons mourned around swift achilles,
weeping full blast. up on olympus, zeus told his queen:

“damn hera, you pulled strings to get achilles back in the fray.
nice job meddling.”

she shot back: “most honored kronides, don’t start.
mortals do petty things all the time. i’m the top goddess

and your wifey, so yeah, i’ll do what i want.”

meanwhile, the silver-foot thetis reached hephaistos’s cosmic forge,
a place shining bright among the immortals, all starry and unstoppable.

she found him sweaty, hustling around his bellows,
crafting fresh tripods to line his palace walls,

each with golden wheels so they’d move on their own— wizard vibes.
he was still chiseling the handles. then his wife charis saw thetis

arrive— lady charis with the bright veil— and took her hand:
“goddess, you rarely visit; what’s the reason for your drop-in?

come in, let me treat you right.” so the goddess led her inside,
seated her on a gorgeous throne with a footstool,

then called big hephaistos: “baby, come see, thetis needs you!”
the famed smith waddled in, that crooked gait unstoppable:

“aw, thetis, she saved me once from drowning sorrow
when my own mother hera tried to toss me out, hating my limp.

thetis and eurynome sheltered me nine years, gave me tools and love,
while i hammered fancy gear under the sea-foam’s swirl.

she’s got that credit in my heart, so let me pay it back.
but first, charis, let’s host her with the best we got

while i tidy up my workspace.” the huge smith
wiped his sweaty face and hands, put on a clean tunic,

grabbed a thick staff, and walked out, golden maids
shuffling around him— living, breathing automata with minds,

just like real girls. he sat across from thetis, took her hand:
“silver-veil goddess, dear friend, speak your mind.

if i can do it, i’ll do it. what’s up?”

thetis wept: “hephaistos, you know all the drama zeus threw my way?

he forced me to marry mortal peleus, and that old man
now rots, but my son rose up so strong, only to be doomed.

he’s losing his best friend— pat’s dead out there.
hektor has stolen achilles’s gear, and my kid stands empty-handed,

burning for revenge but lacking any armor. please,
give him something unstoppable, so he can avenge pat.”

hephaistos answered: “fear not. i wish i could hide him from death, too,
but i can at least forge gear that’ll blow minds.”

he left her there, turned to his fiery forge:
the bellows, some twenty in total, roared at his nod,

pumping all sorts of blasts wherever he aimed,
helping him shape bronze, tin, gold, silver,

with a massive anvil and tongs. first he made
a giant shield, thick with five folds, hammered bright rims,

a silver handle band, then poured in cosmic scenes:
he put earth, sky, the unstoppable sea, the blazing sun,

the waxing moon, and all the stars that crown the heavens:
the pleiades, hyades, orion’s might, and the bear (aka the wagon),

forever spinning but never dipping in ocean’s bath.

next, he crafted two city scenes of mortal folk:

in one, weddings, parties, shimmering torches
escorting brides from their rooms, the crowd singing

as youths whirled in dance, flutes and lyres echoing,
the ladies gawked from doorways, each enthralled.

in the marketplace, a brawl over blood-money for a murdered man:
one side said “pay up,” the other said “nah,”
the elders sat in a circle with scepters, dishing out judgments.
golden weights in the middle for the rightful decision.

the second city was under siege, armies shining with gear,
split on whether to loot or divvy up the spoil.
the walls bristled with watchers— wives, kids, old men.

ares and athena, both golden, led the troops,
like gods indeed, smaller folks behind them.

they ambushed herds by the river, while shepherds jammed on pipes,
then the enemy pounced, slaying herdsmen. men hopped on horses

to rescue them, clashing in a swirl of spears,
strife, panic, and deadly fate soared among ’em, dripping blood,

dragging bodies by the feet.

then a lush farmland scene, plowed in neat lines,
reapers with sickles, gleaners bundling stalks,
children carrying sheaves, the king beaming silent with a scepter.
the heralds under an oak prepared a grand feast,

while women sprinkled fine white barley for the laborers.

then a vineyard heavy with ripe grapes in gold,
a trench of dark metal, a fence of shining tin around it,
one slender path for pickers to come and go.
young men, girls in sweet bloom carried woven baskets,

while a boy plucked a lyre, singing a light tune.
everyone danced, skipping in sync, reveling in the harvest.

then a herd of sleek, shambling cattle carved in gold and tin,
lowing from the stable to graze by a murmuring stream.
two lions jumped the lead bull, it bellowed,

the herdmen tried but couldn’t chase them off,
dogs barked close but wouldn’t bite the lions.

next a pastoral valley for shining sheep, pens, huts, and stables.

then a dancing floor, daedalus-style, like in broad knossos,
where youth and bloom parted and joined hands,
the girls robed in soft linen, the boys in fine tunics oiled bright,
some wore cool golden daggers. they’d spin in circles

like a potter spinning his wheel, or break into lines.
a big crowd ringed ’em, hype stoking the vibe,
two acrobats flipping in the middle.

finally, around the shield’s rim, he poured the power of ocean’s flow,
then fashioned a blazing breastplate, a massive helm with a golden crest,
and hammered out bright greaves of soft tin.

done forging, he set them before thetis. picking them up,
she soared off olympus like a hawk, carrying that shiny new drip
to her sorrowful son.
