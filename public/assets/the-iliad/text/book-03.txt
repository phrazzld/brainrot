yo muse, let’s vibe on how the squads flexed up for battle,
trojans front and center with their war-lords shining,
their voices screaming to the skies
like a swarm of savage birds—
for real, like that wild crane chorus
that screeches overhead, ducking winter storms
to roll up on the pygmy squads by the ocean,
dropping drama from the clouds on those tiny folks.

but the achaean homies came in perfect silence,
rage on lock, eyes peeled for blood,
like a thick fog sliding down a mountain slope
under a south wind—shepherds hate that vibe,
burglars probably love it
‘cause you can’t see more than a rock’s toss ahead.
that’s how dust rose under achaean feet,
a swirling hush on the plains. big mood.

once they squared off,
alexandros (paris) the glow-up king
stepped out front in a jazzy cloak,
bow slung on his shoulder, sword at the hip,
twin spears shining bronze,
calling for any achaean goat
to catch these hands one-on-one, no cap.

menelaos the war-lord spotted him,
lit up like a hungry lion stumbling
on a fat stag or goat, so starved he just feasts
without caring about dogs or hunters behind him.
that’s menelaos, seeing glitzy alexandros—
thinking he’s finally bagging his kill.
he hopped off his chariot, ready for a throwdown.

alexandros, seeing menelaos the real one, panicked:
his heart hammered, and he ghosted to his lines
like a dude in the forest who steps on a snake
and freaks out, legs jelly, face pale,
scrambling back in fear. that was paris,
pretty as a goddess but zero courage,
dipping from menelaos, atreus’s mighty son.

hektor of the glinting helm saw that coward move
and glared savage at paris, spitting words:
“bro, you pretty-boy headache, craving queen-level babes,
but you’re all talk. i wish you’d never been born
or at least died single. we trojans are all side-eyed now,
the long-haired achaeans cackle at how weak our ‘prince’ is.
you look dope, sure—face, hair, fashion—
but zero grit. was it the plan
when you cruised on your wave-runner ships,
dragging homies to snatch a foreign bae from warrior men,
just to trash your dad and city?
you hand free w’s to the enemy,
and shame us all. now you’re too shook to face menelaos?
you see the man whose wifey you jacked. your dope hair
and aphrodite’s freebies won’t save you
once you’re face-down in the dirt, clown.
the trojans must be soft or you’d already be stoned for this mess.”

alexandros shot back:
“hektor, you’re not wrong, but ease up a bit.
your heart is savage, unstoppable—like a carpenter’s axe
hacking through timber, never rattling.
don’t hate on the goddess gifts i got—mortals can’t just toss ’em aside.
still, if you want me to duel menelaos, i’m game.
tell the trojans and achaeans to drop weapons,
i’ll square up with menelaos in the middle
for helen and all her stuff. whoever wins
keeps the prize, the rest can sign that peace
and bounce to their homes. trojans stay behind our walls,
achaeans back to argos with their hottie-laden towns.”

hektor was hyped. he strode out, spear half-lowered,
the trojan ranks parted, but the achaeans aimed arrows and stones.
agamemnon the alpha barked:
“argive squad, hold your fire.
hektor’s coming in peace talk mode.”
everyone froze; dead quiet.

hektor bridged the gap:
“trojans and you well-greaved achaeans, hear me:
alexandros says let’s end the drama.
we drop our gear, let him and menelaos
throw down for helen and all her loot.
winner keeps the package,
we all swear unbreakable oaths and dip.”

the crowd said nothing. menelaos the war-lord spoke:
“listen up, squads. i’m the one who’s eaten the most heartbreak from all this.
it’s time to end it. let me and alexandros fight to the death,
and whichever man stands, that’s it.
bring two lambs—one for the earth and the sun, black for the deeper gods—
and a third for zeus. also, get old priam out here to vow
in person, since his sons are known for stunts.
young blood is wild, but an elder sees forward and back.”

the armies cheered, hoping the war was done.
they unyoked horses, stashed gear in neat piles
with a tiny space between.
hektor sent heralds for lambs and priam.
agamemnon sent talthybios back to the achaean ships
for another lamb. all in on the plan.

meanwhile, iris swung by helen’s palace,
shapeshifting into a friend of hers.
helen was weaving a huge purple tapestry,
stitched with trojan and achaean battles—
all because of her. iris whispered:
“girl, come watch the action. trojans and achaeans
just sat it out, spears planted, war on pause.
alexandros and menelaos will duel over you.
winner takes you as official bae.”

a wave of longing for her old life and city hit helen.
tears rolling, she pulled on a white veil
and left with her maids, aithra and klymene,
up to the sky-high gates where the trojan elders—priam, panthoos,
thymaites, lampus, hiketaon, oukalegon, anténor—chilled,
too old to fight but savage with words,
perched like cicadas buzzing in a tree.

seeing helen, they murmured:
“no wonder trojans and greeks bled so long—
she’s basically goddess-level. even so, let her sail back
so we’re not cursed further.”

priam called:
“come here, dear child. sit by me.
i blame the gods, not you. now tell me,
who’s that big achaean boss strutting out there?
he’s not the tallest, but the aura is insane.”

helen, shining among women, said:
“father-in-law, you humble me. i wish a grim end
had taken me before i left my homeland,
my sweet child, my dear circle. but oh well.
that man is agamemnon, son of atreus, wide-ruling king
and my former brother-in-law… if i’m worthy of that name.”

priam nodded:
“blessed atreides, leading a vast achaean host.
i once saw a legion of phrygians on the sangarios banks
when the amazons showed up— savage—
but that’s nothing compared to these endless achaeans.”

next, he pointed at odysseus:
“helen, who’s that smaller but thick-shouldered warrior,
weaving among the ranks like a ram among snowy sheep?”

helen, daughter of zeus, replied:
“that’s odysseus, laertes’ cunning son from rocky ithaca,
mastermind of a thousand schemes.”

anténor chimed in:
“facts, lady. i recall menelaos and odysseus visiting for you,
and i hosted them. menelaos was quick and clear,
odysseus stared at the floor, staff motionless, looking clueless.
but once he spoke, words flowed like winter snow.
nobody could match him. we all sat in hushed awe.”

priam then noticed a third warrior, huge as a tower:
helen said:
“that’s aias, the achaean wall,
and that other shining one among the cretans is idomeneus,
who menelaos hosted in sparta.
i see every curly-haired achaean i know,
but my brothers, castor the horse-whisperer and polydeukes the boxer,
i don’t see them. maybe they stayed in lacedaemon,
ashamed of me.” (though they were dead back home.)

heralds arrived with the lambs, shiny wine, and gear.
idaíos told priam:
“we need you in the no-man’s-land, sir.
alexandros and menelaos fight for the woman.
winner keeps her. the rest sign peace.”

the old man shuddered but hopped on his chariot with anténor,
whipping the horses through the scaean gates to the plain.
they rolled up where trojans and achaeans stood, hopped down,
meeting agamemnon and odysseus in the center.
the heralds set the lambs, mixed wine in a big bowl,
and poured water for the top dogs to wash.
agamemnon drew his sword, cut hair from each lamb’s head,
the heralds passed it around, and atreides prayed:

“father zeus on ida, grandest,
and you sun, plus rivers, earth, and underworld watchers of oaths—
hear us. if alexandros slays menelaos, he keeps helen and her stuff.
we go home. but if blond menelaos kills alexandros,
trojans must give helen back with all her loot,
and pay a penalty that echoes for future days.
but if priam and his sons won’t pay,
i stay till i win that payment or we all fall.”

he slit the lambs’ throats; they thrashed on the ground.
both sides poured out wine, praying to the undying gods:
“zeus, immortals, whoever breaks this truce,
spill their brains like this wine, let their wives be taken.”

but zeus wasn’t blessing just yet. priam said:
“trojans, greeks, i’m going home. i can’t watch my boy fight menelaos,
the gods will pick who dies.”

he loaded the lambs, drove back to ilion.
hektor and odysseus measured a dueling spot,
threw lots in a bronze helmet to decide who’d spear first,
while both armies prayed:
“zeus on ida, whichever man stirred this chaos, let him fall,
let us sign peace forever.”

hektor turned his gaze, shook the lots—alexandros drew the short straw.
warriors lined up. glitzy alexandros, helen’s man, armed up:
silver-clipped greaves,
a breastplate from his brother that fit snug,
a silver-studded sword, a solid shield,
a glorious horsehair helmet, crest shimmering,
and a spear in his grip.
menelaos the war-lord did the same.

they faced each other in that narrow stretch
between trojan and achaean lines, eyes blazing,
spears pointed. alexandros hurled first,
but his spear tip bent on menelaos’s shield.

then menelaos prayed:
“zeus, let me wreck this clown who started it all.
so no one disses a good host again.”

he hurled his spear—straight through paris’s shield and mail,
grazing his side. alexandros juked from a lethal blow.
menelaos yanked his sword, smashed paris’s helmet crest,
but the blade snapped in shards. menelaos howled:
“father zeus, you savage! i thought i had him,
yet my spear and sword betrayed me.”

still raging, he grabbed the helmet strap, choking paris out,
dragging him toward achaean lines. that strap bit under his chin—
paris was seconds from humiliating capture.
but aphrodite, daughter of zeus, made it snap,
the helmet flew off in menelaos’s fist.
the war-lord lunged with his spear,
but aphrodite whisked paris away, cloaked in mist,
poofed him into a perfumed bedroom in troy.

the goddess then found helen among trojan ladies,
tugged her robe, disguised as an old weaving-lady:
“hey girl, paris wants you back at the crib,
dressed up like he didn’t just get beat.
he’s shining like he’s fresh off a dance.”

helen recognized the goddess’s shining eyes, hissed:
“you manipulative deity, why drag me further?
menelaos bested alexandros. i should go home.
do you want to stash me in phrygia for more chaos?
go cozy up to him yourself, i’m done.”

aphrodite flared up:
“watch your tongue, mortal, or i’ll let both sides turn on you.
just do what i say.”

shaking, helen obeyed, slipping away unseen,
led by the goddess to alexandros’s lavish palace.
the maids returned to their chores. helen entered the bedroom,
where aphrodite sat her across from him.
she glared:
“so you survived? i wish you’d died out there.
menelaos has you beat. maybe go fight him again—
or better yet, don’t.”

paris murmured:
“woman, don’t slash me with your barbs.
athena gave menelaos the advantage this round,
but next time i’ll get him. for now, let’s vibe in bed—
i’m more thirsty for you than ever, not even in sparta
did i crave you this hard.”

he led her to the inlaid bed, she followed,
and they vanished into the sheets.

menelaos roamed the field like a raging beast,
seeking alexandros, but no trojan could tell him where the coward went—
they hated him too.
agamemnon bellowed:
“trojans, dardanians, allies, menelaos takes the w.
hand over helen and all her gear, plus the penalty you owe,
so future folks remember. that’s final.”

the achaean squads roared in triumph.
