yo muse, let’s vibe on how pallas athena
juiced up tydeus’s kid diomedes
with savage hype and fearless heart,
so he’d flex as the real mvp
among the argive homies and snatch big-time clout:
she lit him up so bright from his helmet and shield,
legit like that late-summer star,
you know, the one shining extra sus
after it’s scrubbed in the ocean’s drip—
that’s the energy dancing off diomedes’ head and shoulders,
making him look op.
athena was like “go off, king,”
so he rolled out to the thick of the brawl,
where the scrum was super sweaty.

there was this trojan name-check: dares,
loaded priest of hephaestus, father of two—
phegeus and idaeus, both cracked at every flavor of combat.
these two homies squared up with diomedes,
rolling up in their chariot while d-man hopped it on foot.
they closed in: phegeus lobbed first,
but his long-shadow spear flew wide
past diomedes’ left shoulder.
tydeus’s kid snapped back,
going full savage with the bronze: no whiff this time.
he pinned phegeus dead-center in the chest,
yeeting him right off the chariot.
idaeus just straight dipped from the fancy platform,
not even staying to hug his brother’s corpse—
and no lie, he’d have gotten wrecked too
if hephaestus hadn’t ghosted him away under a magic cloak,
‘cause he was big pressed about an old man’s heartbreak.
diomedes snagged their horses, told his homies
to hustle them back to the hollow ships.

the trojans freaked, seeing one bro down
and the other hitting the eject seat,
so the whole vibe got tense.
but grey-eyed athena reached out
and hollered at savage ares:
“ares, ares—bro of carnage, city-wrecker,
how about we let these trojans and achaians
keep smashing each other,
whichever side papa zeus wants to hype, that’s their luck.
you and me, let’s ghost out,
dodging big daddy’s wrath? no reason to stress.”

that’s how she coaxed slaughter-hungry ares out the fray,
parked him by the scamander’s bank,
so the danaans started rolling the trojans,
each leader snagging a big kill.
agamemnon was first: he stomped odios from his chariot—
a quick turn, the spear jammed between shoulders and chest,
down he crashed.
big idomeneus nailed phaistos, borus’s kid from fertile tarne,
speared him on the right shoulder as he tried to mount up.
darkness swallowed him, idomeneus’s crew stripped his gear.

menelaus took out skamandrios, son of strophios,
the epic huntsman taught by goddess artemis—
but she sure didn’t help him now.
menelaus fed him a long spear below the shoulder blades,
it tore through his chest,
he faceplanted, armor rattling.

meriones clocked phereklos, the craft pro
who once built fine ships for alexandros,
triggering trojan downfall.
fate said “gg.”
meriones caught him in the right butt cheek, savage angle,
straight under the bone near the bladder.
down he howled, death covering him.

next, meges—pride of phyleus—murked pedaios,
love-child of antenor, raised kindly by theano.
meges jammed a spear in the back of his skull,
it burst out the mouth—he bit the dust, cold bronze tasting.
then eurypylos, son of euaimon,
took out hypsenor, the dope son of dolopion,
priest of scamandros, revered like a deity by trojans.
eurypylos hacked that strong right arm off,
blood soaked the field, purple doom claimed him.

lines kept grinding in savage clash,
but diomedes was unstoppable, unstoppable.
the man rampaged like a raging flash flood
ripping through bridges after monstrous downpour,
blasting farmland. no dam holds it.
the trojan ranks scattered under tydeus’s boy,
even though they outnumbered him.

lykaon’s shining kid spotted him,
immediately drew his bow to clap diomedes,
pinning him in the right shoulder, arrow punching through the plate,
painting his gear in blood.
lykaon’s kid hollered: “yo trojans,
we just tagged the top achaian stud,
he can’t last that lethal shaft—big dub for me,
apollo’s hype from lycia!”

but the arrow didn’t break diomedes.
he pulled back by his horses and said to sthenelos:
“bro, yank this nasty arrow out my shoulder.”
so sthenelos hopped down, yanked it out,
blood spattering the twisted tunic.
diomedes prayed: “listen, daughter of zeus,
if you or dad ever had my back,
roll up again. let me smoke that clown
who said i won’t see tomorrow’s sun.”

athena heard, gave him super speed in arms and legs,
stood near him and said:
“fear not, d-man. i just juiced you with fatherly fury.
also cleared the war-fog from your eyes,
so you can tell mortal from god.
don’t swing on immortals—unless aphrodite shows up.
you can cut her, no cap.”
then she dipped,
and diomedes jumped back to the front lines,
now triple-lion-mode.

he kills astynouos and hypeiron,
one with a spear under the nipple, the other with a sword near the collarbone.
aband and polyeidos—sons of eurydamas—fell next,
their old man a dream-reader who never saw that.
then xanthos and thoon, shining kids of phainops,
who had no others to inherit; father left in tears.
diomedes left them. some cousins would loot the estate.

next echamon and chromios, kids of king priam,
riding one chariot—he pounced like a lion onto calves,
ripped them out, stripped their gear, gave their horses to his squad.
seeing this carnage, aeneas came searching pandaros.
he found lykaon’s unstoppable son and said:
“bro, where’s that bow flex? we need your arrow skills
to stop this savage humiliating us. maybe it’s mortal, or a grudged god.”

pandaros was like: “dude, that unstoppable is diomedes.
i already arrowed him, did squat.
he’s got some god on retainer.
i left my horses in lycia—worried about feeding them, big mistake.
my bow’s worthless.
i shot menelaus and diomedes, drew blood but just made them mad.
once i get home, i’m burning this bow. worthless.
but let’s team up, use your chariot, see if we can spear him to hades.”

aeneas: “cool, hop in. i got the best horse dna from anchises.
you handle the spear, i’ll drive, or vice versa.”
pandaros climbed aboard, aeneas took the reins.

sthenelos saw them booking it and warned diomedes:
“dude, watch out, that’s pandaros plus aeneas, aphrodite’s kid.”
diomedes side-eyed him: “bro, i’m not dipping.
athena’s got my back. i’ll smoke them, or maybe one escapes.
if i kill them both, you snag those sweet horses—
descendants of zeus’s line. we want that loot.”

they got close, pandaros teased first:
“no arrow? i’ll try the spear.” he threw,
pinging diomedes’s shield but not punching through.
pandaros thought he had a kill. diomedes was unbothered:
“you missed. guess one of us is feeding war’s blood.”
he flung his spear, guided by athena,
nailing pandaros under the eye, busting through teeth,
slicing his tongue, out the jaw.
pandaros fell off the chariot, gear clattering, soul gone.

aeneas hopped down to shield the body,
like a lion protecting its cub.
diomedes pried a huge rock two men today couldn’t lift,
but he flexed it easy, chucked it at aeneas’s hip,
smashing the joint, snapping tendons.
aeneas collapsed, black night shading his eyes.

he’d be toast if aphrodite, his mommy, hadn’t come in,
wrapping her white arms around him,
draping him in shimmering robes so no achaian could stab.
she tried to haul him off, but sthenelos was busy
snatching the trojans’ fancy horses as planned,
gave them to deiopylos to drive back.

diomedes chased aphrodite, knowing she wasn’t built for war.
he lunged, stabbing her delicate wrist with savage thrust,
ichor dripping from that immortal flesh.
she screeched, dropping aeneas;
apollo whisked him off in dark mist to keep him safe.

diomedes trolled her: “stay off the battlefield, zeus-daughter,
ain’t it enough you trick mortal women?
step here again, you’ll feel the freeze of war.”
aphrodite ran, trembling, iris whisked her away,
found ares, her bro, chilling with his spear on the sidelines.

she fell to her knees, begging: “ares, let me borrow your gold-laced horses.
some mortal clown cut me—diomedes—he’d fight zeus next.”
ares let her hop on, iris grabbed the reins, whipped them upward.
they soared to olympus; iris unyoked them, fed them ambrosia,
while diodione cradled aphrodite, cooing:
“all gods have felt mortal pain, sweet child—like ares, hera, hades—
you gotta deal. blame that troublemaker athena for spurring diomedes.”

meanwhile, diomedes still trying to kill aeneas.
three times he charged, apollo bopped him away.
the fourth time, the far-shooter barked: “back off, mortal.
know your place. we’re not the same species.”
so diomedes stepped back, apollo took aeneas to pergame,
letting artemis and leto heal him.

apollo made a phantom aeneas to keep the fight going,
and ares, spurred by apollo, disguised as akamas,
rallied the trojans, flooding them with fresh bloodlust.
sarpedon scolded hector for slack defense:
“we came from far to help, you’re letting us do all the heavy lifting.
man up or see your city fall.”

hector felt the sting, jumped from his chariot,
rallied the troops like a swirling dust wind over fields,
pumped by ares, while hera and athena, seeing achaean trouble,
geared up in heaven.
hera pulled out the gold-bridled horses,
hebe fixed the wheels on that glorious chariot.
they soared down, parted the gates of heaven,
found zeus on olympus’s peak.

hera asked if he’s cool with them punishing ares.
zeus said, “fine, do it. bring athena. she’s best at humbling that psycho.”
they flew across the sky, landed by the trojan rivers,
unleashed the horses, sped off like pigeons in human form
to the thick of the clash.

hera amped the achaian lines with stentor’s voice:
“shame, argives! achilles isn’t here,
so trojans push you to the ships? do better!”
she found diomedes near his chariot, nursing that arrow wound.
she teased: “guess you’re not your father’s son. tydeus was smaller but savage.
he came to thebes once, i told him to chill, but he still flexed on the cadmeians.
and you? chilling? tired or spooked? that’s not tydeus.”

diomedes answered: “i know you, goddess.
you told me not to fight gods except aphrodite,
but ares is on the field. what can i do?”
athena said: “nah, i got your back. let’s go jump meltdown-lord ares.
spew no fear.”

she shoved sthenelos aside, hopped in with diomedes,
the axle groaning under goddess + hero.
athena seized the reins, driving straight for ares,
who was finishing off periphas.

ares lunged from above, but athena slapped the spear aside.
diomedes struck next, guided by athena,
jamming the spear into ares’s gut, where belt meets flesh,
tearing his fair skin.
ares roared like ten thousand men in pitched brawl,
scaring both armies.
he soared to the sky in a black storm, up to olympus,
complaining to zeus, showing immortal blood:
“dad, aren’t you pissed how gods tear me up for mortals?
your daughter’s nuts—she unleashed diomedes.
he stabbed aphrodite, then me. i’d be dead if i stayed.”

zeus glared: “stop whining, double-cross.
you love war and blood—mom’s fault.
still, you’re my son, so i’ll fix you.
but if you were anyone else, you’d rot in tartarus.”

paiëon applied magic painkillers, healing the wound swift as curdled milk.
hebe bathed him, robed him, and he sat by zeus,
boasting in new drip.
hera and athena left the battlefield, job done,
stopping ares’s man-slaying fury.
