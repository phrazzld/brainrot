turnus sees how latium’s vibe is tanking,
the people eyeing him, wanting his vow or his downfall;
like a wounded lion on the punic plains,
feeling that spear lodged in his hide, shaking his shaggy neck,
snapping the poacher’s shaft, mouth all bloody with fury—
that’s him, turnus, all pumped, unquenchable rage rising:

he storms up to king latinus: “pops, the trojans said they want a big final duel.
no more stalling—imma meet aeneas alone, throw him into hades,
or, if i flop, let him take the w, plus lavinia’s ring.”

king latinus, playing wise dad: “whoa, savage youth,
i see your valor’s unmatched, but let me keep it 100:
you got daunius’s old kingdom, loads of captured towns,
and i got gold, hella farmland, plus the laurentine ladies.
lavinia was fated for no man among the locals—
the gods said so, but i broke all the locks, i gave you my blessing.
look at the chaos that caused: troy-wars 2.0, fields thick with bones,
the tiber flooding with our blood.
we can barely cling to these walls. if i’m ready to call a truce with aeneas
should you get dropped—why not skip the middle meltdown?
what if you die? what will rutuli say? or the rest of italy?
please, have a heart for your poor father daunus.”

turnus ignores the caution: “nah, let me buy that glory with my life.
the trojan’s got a goddess mom? so what.
my own blade can slice just fine, i bleed if i’m cut—
and i ain’t planning to hide in no cloud.”

queen amata wails, grabbing turnus’s hand:
“oh, turnus, you’re my last anchor, the only fortress for me and old latium.
if you ride to that 1v1 and get bodied, i’ll straight up end myself,
never seeing aeneas as my new son.”
lavinia listens, tears on her blazing cheeks, pink flooding that pale face
like lilies spliced with roses.
turnus sees her glow, and his heart throbs even fiercer,
but he just says, “please, no tears, mother, i’m locked in. i can’t avoid my fate.”
then he calls for his horses, the ones orithyia gave pilumnus,
white as january snow, swift as the wind.
he glams up in a gold-and-orichalc breastplate, a big red-crested helm,
the sword vulcan forged for papa daunus, quenched in styx.
he yanks a monstrous spear from the palace colonnade, an old spoil from actor,
shouts: “you’ve always had my back, oh spear—help me wreck that half-man trojan,
rip his fancy gear, smear his hair in dust.”
sparks spit from his mouth as he speaks, eyes raging with fire,
like a bull smashing a trunk, tossing his head in some alpha meltdown.

aeneas, too, suits up in his mom’s handcrafted gear,
psyched that at last they can do that 1v1 for real.
he calms his worried allies, encourages young iulus,
and sends the official word to king latinus: the pact stands.

next dawn breaks, sunlight beaming over the mountaintops,
ranks of rutuli and trojans line the field under the city walls,
they set up altars of turf, prep the fire and holy water,
everyone wearing wreaths of herbs, all solemn.
in come the trojans with tuscan squads, arcadians in painted gear,
like they’re geared for the actual war, not just a duel.
latins pile out, spears glinting, motherfolk swarming ramparts or rooftops for a better view.

from high on a peak, juno’s scanning the scene,
the lines drawn, the city trembling with tension.
she calls out to juturna, turnus’s sister, the river-nymph:
“bestie, i love you more than any other who clambered up jove’s bed—
i tried saving your bro, but them fates are savage, that day draws near.
i can’t watch, so if you can do something, do it.”
juturna cries, pounding her chest, but juno’s like,
“nah, no time for tears—do your bro a solid, break the pact if you must. i’ll back you.”

down below, latinus rides a gold-rayed chariot,
turnus stands in white with a pair of spears,
aeneas steps up shining in star-forged arms, ascanius by his side,
a pure-robed priest bringing the cattle to the flame.
they do the ritual, sprinkle salt, mark the animal heads, pour wine from bowls.
then pious aeneas lifts his sword in vow:
“listen, sun, father jove, mars, seas, rivers, powers above and below:
if turnus wins, we trojans bounce, let iulus go find new digs, no more war.
if i win, i won’t enslave the latins, i don’t want the crown—
we’ll live side by side in peace, latinus keeps his power,
and i’ll build my city, naming it after lavinia. bet?”

latinus echoes: “i swear by earth, seas, stars, double-faced janus, by pluto’s shrine,
let no day break this peace or these pledges. if i break them,
my scepter, once a living branch, never again sprouts leaves, that’s my witness.”
they slit the throats of the beasts, pile the altars.

but the rutuli squads been feeling sussed out, like the odds are stacked.
they see turnus stepping up with pallor on his youthful face,
makes them question: “why’s one dude risking everything for us all?
we’re not outnumbered, we can jump the trojans!”
juturna, disguised as camers, fans that flame:
“come on, rutuli, we can literally beat them by numbers alone!
why let turnus shoulder the entire war? let’s all brawl, defend our fatherland.”
the crowd mutters, momentum building.

then she flings a sign from above: an eagle, jove’s golden bird,
swoops a swan from the shore, but that swan’s flock rallies,
swarming the eagle, forcing it to drop the prey and flee.
tolumnius the augur yells, “that’s the sign i wanted!
the trojan’s that eagle, we’re the underdogs banding to throw him off.
pick up arms, defend turnus!”
he hurls a spear, nails one arcadian in a batch of nine bros, kills him.
the arcadians freak out, the laurentes freak out, chaos spills over the altars,
they tear the fires and bowls apart, flinging weapons.
latinus flees, seeing the pact shattered, the gods dissed.
messapus kills a tyrrhenian king at an altar, guys fling torches,
corynaeus bashes a foe with a flaming brand, madness unhinged.
aeneas shouts, “why are we wiling out? i’m the only one who should be fighting turnus!”
just as he’s mid-speech, an unknown arrow zips in, hits him—
who shot it? who knows.
the trojans see him withdraw, wounded, and panic.
turnus sees that, leaps onto his chariot, tears into trojan ranks,
like mars raging on a thracian plain, or unstoppable cavalry in open field.
bodies stack up, hooves thick with gore.

meanwhile aeneas is hustled off to the camp, bleeding,
raging to get the arrow out and return to the fray.
the doc is iapyx, taught healing by apollo, but it’s not helping—
the arrow’s stuck, his blood’s blocking the wound.
the trojans watch the city overhead, dust clouds of war intensifying,
venus, seeing her son in agony, picks a magic herb from crete,
slips it into the water iapyx uses, the pain dissolves, the arrow slides out,
strength floods aeneas anew. iapyx marvels, “this is from the gods. go fight!”
aeneas straps his armor, kisses ascanius: “learn real hustle from me, luck from someone else.
but i’ll keep you safe for now, you remember your old man’s example.”
he storms out with mnestheus and the trojan rank,
the ground trembling under their feet, swirling dust.
turnus, on the far side, wonders at the thunder of trojan boots,
juturna senses big trouble. aeneas blasts onto the plain like a stormcloud,
heads for the city gates, cutting down rutuli in waves,
looking for turnus, ignoring all else.

then sweet mother venus nudges him: go for the city, scare them with big destruction.
he climbs a mound, calls mnestheus, serestus, the trojan legion,
“grab torches, we burn latium’s capital if they won’t yield.
no more waiting for turnus’s final show.”
pandemonium: trojans scale the walls, fling spears from ladders,
others hack at the gates. aeneas roars up at latinus:
“look, i tried peace—twice your side snapped it. i’ll flatten your city.”
the latins inside freak: some want to open the gates, let him in, end this,
others snatch up weapons for a last stand.
like a beekeeper who smokes the hive, the bees scramble within,
the city’s full of screaming, black smoke rising.

queen amata sees trojans in the streets, no sign of turnus or rutuli,
assumes he’s dead, curses herself as the cause of all,
and in a grief-fueled mania, ties a noose from a high beam,
chokes out her final breath.
the women shriek, lavinia rips her golden hair, the palace wails.
news spreads. latinus rips his garments, dust in his white hair, city undone.

turnus, on the battlefield, chasing stragglers, hears the dreadful outcry.
he yanks his reins, demanding, “what’s this mess?”
juturna, still disguised as his charioteer, tries to steer him back,
“we can keep slaughtering trojans here. others can defend at home.”
he snaps: “sis, i know it’s you, a goddess messing my fight,
but i’m done. i saw murranus, my dear friend, gutted.
i saw ufens die. and i’ll not let drances crow over me.
no, i must go—if i must die, so be it.”
just then, an arrow-pierced rider, saces, gallops up, begging:
“turnus, you alone can save latium—
aeneas is torching the city, queen amata is gone,
latinus is paralyzed, we’re pinned at the gates. help.”
turnus stands in stunned silence, guilt, fury, heartbreak swirling.
then the illusions clear. he sees the city in flames, leaps from his chariot,
“enough, sis,” he says to juturna. “the fates outrun us. let me face aeneas.”
like a boulder ripped from a mountainside by storms,
rolling unstoppable, flattening goats, men, trees,
turnus charges for the city walls, parts the crowd, waves them aside:
“enough, rutuli, i’ll pay the price alone.”
they break away, trojans freeze, latins freeze, everyone steps back.

aeneas hears turnus’s name, leaves the fortress assault, rejoicing with rattling arms,
like a mountain giant—eryx or athos—looming in the sky.
both armies stare, the fight halts all over,
even king latinus is thunderstruck to see them close in single combat.
they meet in the open, exchanging spear throws that ring off shields,
earth groans underfoot, swords flash, strength and luck entwined.
like two bulls on a taburnus summit, horns locked,
the herd watching, trembling, seeing who’ll rule,
gore streaming, loud roars echo the forest—
so aeneas and turnus lock, thunder filling the heavens,
while jove balances their fates in golden scales above.

turnus sees a spot and tries a savage sword blow—
but his blade, a stolen charioteer’s sword, snaps mid-swing,
he realizes he left his real father’s blade at home.
panic, he scampers around, aeneas presses in, though slowed by his old wound,
the trojans ring them in, behind turnus is the moat and city walls.
like a wolfdog chasing a stag near the riverbank, the poor deer tries a thousand ways to flee,
the dog's jaws snap an inch short. the hills echo with shouts.
turnus, running, begs his men for another sword, yells each friend by name.
aeneas threatens total destruction if they help, so no one does.
they circle the field five times—this ain’t play, it’s life or death.

then turnus stumbles near a sacred stump to faunus.
aeneas’s spear was lodged there, stuck in the tough root.
he tries to yank it free, but faunus, hearing turnus’s prayer,
keeps the wood clenched, remembering how trojans dissed this holy trunk.
in that moment, juturna, disguised, returns turnus’s old sword,
but venus, outraged, tugs the trojan spear loose for her son.
now both heroes stand renewed—turnus holding his father’s blade, aeneas brandishing the recovered spear.

up on olympus, jupiter calls out juno, who’s watching from a golden cloud:
“enough, dear wife. you know aeneas’s fate, you admitted it.
why keep meddling, handing turnus his sword, stirring illusions?
give it up, or your silent sorrow will vex me. you did enough—
they’ve had war, heartbreak, all that. stop now.”
juno, eyes lowered, relents: “okay, i yield.
just promise me one last request:
when they do get peace, unify with marriage, let the latins keep their name,
don’t rename them trojans or force them to speak trojan style.
let them remain latins, let troy fade. keep italy’s identity.”
jupiter grins: “deal. i’ll merge them physically, but keep the latin name,
and they’ll become a glorious new race that cherishes me.”
juno’s satisfied, leaves the cloud.

then jove summons one of the dread dirae,
the monstrous sisters born from blackest night,
sends it to break juturna’s meddling.
a screeching fiend soars down like a lethal arrow,
turnus hears its wings shriek overhead, his limbs freeze, hair bristles.
juturna recognizes the grim sign, tears her cheeks in despair,
“i can’t help you, bro. i must dip,” and plunges into the river’s depths, weeping.

aeneas corners turnus, brandishing an oak-sized spear:
“why stall, turnus? no more sprints—let’s brawl with steel.”
turnus shakes his head: “the gods terrify me, not you, trojan.”
he heaves a giant boundary stone, tries to fling it,
but can’t muster his old speed; knees buckle, vision blurs,
like nightmares where you can’t run or speak.
the rock falls short, turnus stands helpless,
trapped, trembling, no sign of his sister or chariot.
aeneas, scanning for an opening, hurls his spear with all his might,
like a catapult’s thunder. it bursts through turnus’s layered shield,
rips the rim of his breastplate, slams his thigh, topples him.
rutuli groan, the hills echo, turnus’s eyes plead, hand outstretched:
“i deserve this, i don’t beg for mercy. but if you feel any fatherly pity,
spare old daunus the heartbreak, or at least return my corpse.
you’ve won, i yield, let lavinia be your queen.”
aeneas stands, sword raised, hesitating—
then he sees the belt, the spoils from pallas that turnus stripped,
his rage explodes: “wearing my friend’s loot? pallas bleeds you for that.”
he thrusts the sword deep into turnus’s chest—
the warrior’s limbs go cold, his soul flees with a final, anguished groan.
