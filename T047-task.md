## Title: Fix script dependency loading and module resolution

## Original Ticket Text:
- [~] **T047: Fix script dependency loading and module resolution**

  - [ ] Standardize module import patterns:
    - [ ] Use consistent import syntax across all files (ESM vs CommonJS)
    - [ ] Fix relative path issues with imports
    - [ ] Address node: prefix requirements for Node.js built-ins
  - [ ] Update import.meta.url usage compatibility:
    - [ ] Add proper TypeScript configurations for ESM modules
    - [ ] Ensure consistent approach for resolving file paths in scripts
    - [ ] Test module loading in both development and production environments
  - [ ] Dependencies: None

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

To effectively address the script dependency loading and module resolution issues, I need to analyze multiple aspects of the current codebase:

1. **Current module systems in use**
   - Identify which files are using ESM vs CommonJS syntax
   - Analyze tsconfig.json settings related to module systems
   - Determine if there are inconsistencies between file extensions, import styles, and configuration

2. **Path resolution issues**
   - Find occurrences of problematic relative paths in imports
   - Identify patterns where imports break in different environments
   - Analyze how path resolution differs between development and production

3. **Node.js built-in module imports**
   - Check for direct imports of Node.js built-ins without the 'node:' prefix
   - Identify modules affected by Node.js version compatibility issues
   - Understand if there are transpilation problems related to built-in modules

4. **import.meta.url usage**
   - Find all instances of import.meta.url in the codebase
   - Understand how these are currently used for file path resolution
   - Identify compatibility issues with different environments or build tools

5. **TypeScript configuration**
   - Analyze current module settings in tsconfig.json
   - Evaluate if separate configurations are needed for different module systems
   - Determine optimal ESM settings that maintain compatibility

My approach will involve:
1. Creating a comprehensive inventory of import patterns and issues
2. Developing standardized approaches for each type of import
3. Creating TypeScript configuration changes to support both ESM and CommonJS
4. Implementing consistent path resolution utilities
5. Testing in multiple environments to ensure compatibility
6. Providing clear documentation for future development

The goal is to establish a consistent, reliable way to handle dependencies across all scripts, minimizing environment-specific issues while maintaining compatibility with both older and newer module systems.
