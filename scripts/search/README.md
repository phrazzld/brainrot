# Search Scripts

This directory contains scripts for searching and exploring assets in the storage systems.
These scripts help with:

- Finding assets based on various criteria
- Auditing asset storage
- Checking for missing or inconsistent assets
- Generating reports about available assets

## Usage

Most scripts can be run directly with:

```
npx tsx scripts/search/script-name.ts [arguments]
```

## Adding New Scripts

If you create a new search script:

1. Place it in this directory
2. Add a comment at the top explaining its purpose
3. Document any required arguments or environment variables
