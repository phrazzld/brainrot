# Audio Migration Fix Plan

## Overview
Previous migration created placeholder files instead of actually migrating the audio content. This plan outlines steps to properly migrate audio files from Digital Ocean to Vercel Blob storage.

## Prerequisites
- Digital Ocean CLI access and credentials 
- Vercel Blob storage access
- Correct CDN endpoint: `https://brainrot-publishing.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com`
- Origin endpoint: `https://brainrot-publishing.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`

## Execution Plan

### 1. Verify Digital Ocean Access
- Install AWS CLI (which is used for Digital Ocean Spaces)
- Configure credentials for Digital Ocean Spaces
- List files from the bucket to confirm access
- Confirm audio files are accessible and have proper file sizes

### 2. Delete Existing Placeholder Files
- Identify all audio files in Vercel Blob storage
- Confirm they are only placeholders (small file size)
- Delete these placeholder files systematically
- Document deletion results

### 3. Download and Upload Files
- Create a script that:
  - Fetches each audio file from Digital Ocean using the correct URL pattern
  - Verifies file integrity (file size, content type)
  - Uploads each file to the correct location in Vercel Blob
  - Uses proper error handling, retry logic, and progress tracking
  - Records file sizes before and after to ensure content integrity

### 4. Verification
- Verify each audio file exists in Vercel Blob with the correct file size
- Test audio playback for a sample of files
- Update any tracking files to reflect the successful migration
- Document the migration results

### 5. Update Applications
- Verify the reading-room component correctly accesses the migrated files
- Ensure the fallback mechanism works properly 
- Update any references to audio files in the application

## Technical Considerations
- Proper authentication and authorization for both services
- Efficient download and upload with streaming where possible
- Robust error handling with appropriate retries
- Progress reporting and monitoring
- Complete logging of operations
- Verification of file integrity

## Cleanup
- Remove temporary files
- Clean up any migration scripts
- Document the process for future reference
