# 📚 Brainrot Publishing House - Monorepo

> _Making classic literature absolutely bussin' for Gen Z, no cap fr fr_

## 🚀 What Is This?

Brainrot Publishing House creates hilarious Gen Z "brainrot" translations of classic literature. We're talking Shakespeare but make it TikTok. Fitzgerald but make it Discord. Homer but make it Twitch chat.

This monorepo contains:

- **Web App**: Next.js reading platform at [brainrot.pub](https://brainrot.pub) (eventually)
- **Translations**: The actual book translations (our crown jewels)
- **Publisher**: Automated publishing to Amazon KDP, Lulu, and more
- **Converter**: Tools to transform content for different platforms

## 🔧 Development

### Tech Stack

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob Storage
- **Publishing**: Playwright (KDP) + Axios (Lulu API)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel

### Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                        # Start all apps in dev mode
pnpm dev --filter=@brainrot/web # Web app only
pnpm build                      # Build everything (174ms with cache!)
pnpm test                       # Run all tests
pnpm lint                       # Lint all packages

# Content Pipeline
pnpm generate:formats [book]    # Convert markdown to all formats
pnpm generate:formats --all     # Process all books
pnpm sync:blob [book]          # Upload to Vercel Blob storage
pnpm sync:blob --all           # Sync all books

# Publishing
pnpm publisher list             # List available books
pnpm publisher validate [book]  # Pre-flight checks
pnpm publisher publish [book] --platform=lulu  # Publish to Lulu
pnpm publisher publish [book] --platform=kdp   # Publish to Amazon
pnpm publisher publish-all [book]              # All platforms

# Utilities
pnpm vault:pull                # Get latest secrets
pnpm monitor:api               # Check API usage
```

### Environment Variables

This project uses **dotenv-vault** for secure secret sharing:

```bash
# First time setup
pnpm vault:login       # Login to dotenv-vault
pnpm vault:pull        # Pull encrypted secrets

# Daily workflow
pnpm vault:pull        # Get latest secrets
pnpm vault:push        # Share your changes
```

Manual setup (if not using vault):

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Vercel blob storage
- Add `LULU_API_KEY` - For print publishing
- Add `KDP_EMAIL/PASSWORD` - For Amazon publishing

See `docs/DOTENV_VAULT_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide.

### 🔒 Security Setup

Protect your secrets with our multi-layer security:

```bash
# Install Git hooks for local secret scanning
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh

# (Optional) Install gitleaks for enhanced scanning
brew install gitleaks

# Run manual security scan
gitleaks detect --source . -v
```

**Security Features:**

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Prevents accidental secret commits
- **GitHub secret scanning** - Monitors pushed code
- **Custom patterns** - Detects service-specific tokens
- **Gitleaks integration** - Advanced local scanning

See `docs/SECRETS.md` for rotation procedures.

## 🏛️ Project Philosophy

We believe classic literature should be:

1. **Accessible** - No more "thou" and "forsooth"
2. **Entertaining** - Actual laugh-out-loud moments
3. **Relevant** - References that make sense today
4. **Respectful** - The stories remain intact
5. **Educational** - Still learning, just more fun

## 🤝 Contributing

This is currently a private project, but we're considering open-sourcing the translation tools. Stay tuned!

## 📄 License

The translations are original creative works. Classic source texts are public domain.

## ✅ Migration Complete

This monorepo was successfully migrated from two repositories with full git history preserved:

- ✅ `brainrot-publishing-house` → `apps/web/`
- ✅ `brainrot-translations` → `content/translations/`

**Old repositories have been archived with deprecation notices.**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Great Gatsby not loading?**
✅ This has been fixed! All books are pre-processed and uploaded.

**Vercel deployment failing?**
Make sure to configure the monorepo settings in Vercel dashboard:

- Root Directory: (leave empty)
- Build Command: `pnpm build --filter=@brainrot/web`
- Output Directory: `apps/web/.next`
  See `docs/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment guide.

### Build failing?

Make sure you have:

- Node.js >= 22.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.15.1
- All environment variables set

### Git history missing?

We use subtree merge to preserve history. If you need to trace back:

```bash
git log --follow apps/web/[file]
git log --follow content/translations/[file]
```
