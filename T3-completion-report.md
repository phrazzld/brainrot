# T3: Remove Unused Variables and Imports - Completion Report

## Task Summary
Identified and removed all unused variables and imports flagged by the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` ESLint rule.

## Changes Made

1. **File: `/app/api/translate/route.ts`**
   - Removed unused variable `errorMessage` in the global catch block
   - The variable was used for error logging but wasn't referenced anywhere else

2. **File: `/app/reading-room/[slug]/page.tsx`**
   - Removed unused import `getAssetUrlWithFallback` from '@/utils'
   - This function was imported but not used anywhere in the component

3. **File: `/utils/types.ts`**
   - Replaced empty interface `GutendexBookDetails` (which extended another interface without adding new properties) with a type alias
   - Changed from:
     ```typescript
     export interface GutendexBookDetails extends GutendexSearchResultItem {
       // Add any fields specific to the details endpoint if different from search item
     }
     ```
   - To:
     ```typescript
     // Currently identical to search result item, but may have specific fields in the future
     export type GutendexBookDetails = GutendexSearchResultItem;
     ```

## Verification
- Ran `npm run lint` to confirm that there are no more unused variable or import errors
- Grep search for `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` shows no matches in .ts or .tsx files
- All ESLint errors related to unused variables and imports have been fixed

## Remaining Issues
There are still other ESLint warnings and errors related to:
- Function complexity
- Function length
- Console statements
- Accessibility issues
- Formatting

These will be addressed in subsequent tasks according to the TODO.md plan.

## Next Step
The next task in the sequence is T4: Add Keyboard Event Handlers to Interactive Elements.
