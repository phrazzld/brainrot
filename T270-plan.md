# T270 Plan: Create .prettierrc.js with code formatting standards

## Task Description
Create `.prettierrc.js` with code formatting standards to ensure consistent code style across the project.

## Classification
This is a **Simple** task that involves creating a Prettier configuration file with appropriate settings.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Prettier configuration**
   - Review Prettier documentation for best practices
   - Identify common settings for Next.js/TypeScript projects
   - Consider ESLint compatibility

2. **Examine current code style**
   - Check existing code to understand current formatting conventions
   - Identify patterns for tabs vs. spaces, line width, etc.

3. **Create .prettierrc.js**
   - Choose JavaScript format for configuration (over JSON) to allow comments
   - Include formatting rules appropriate for the project
   - Document why certain settings were chosen with comments

4. **Test the configuration**
   - Verify the configuration is valid
   - Test Prettier with the new configuration on a sample file

## Expected Results
A well-documented `.prettierrc.js` file that defines consistent formatting standards for the project, aligned with industry best practices and compatible with ESLint.
