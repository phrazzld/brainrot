3. **updateComingSoonCovers.ts** - Updated translation files with new paths

## Results

- All 13 covers successfully migrated to standardized locations
- All translation files updated to reference new paths
- Placeholder image replaced with actual cover art
- Development server running and serving correct images

## Verification

The migration was verified through:

1. Dry-run execution to preview changes
2. Successful copy operations with URL confirmation
3. Translation file updates confirmed
4. Development server started on port 3002

## Next Steps
