# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical data and temporary files that are no longer needed for active development but are preserved for reference.

## Structure

- **migration-data/** - Migration scripts, reports, and logs from data migration efforts
- **reports/** - Historical verification and test reports
- **temp-files/** - Temporary files, deprecated configurations, and one-off refactoring plans

## Purpose

Files here are kept for:

- Historical reference and debugging
- Understanding migration decisions
- Compliance and audit trails

These files can generally be safely deleted if disk space is needed, but are preserved to maintain project history.
