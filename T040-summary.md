# T040 Partial Implementation: Fix logger and module import errors in utility scripts

## Completed Changes

1. Fixed import issues in `scripts/asset-migration/copyToPlaceholder.ts`:

   - Corrected import paths from `../utils/logger` to `../../utils/logger`
   - Corrected import paths from `../utils/services/BlobService` to `../../utils/services/BlobService`
   - Changed import from named import `{ logger as _logger }` to default import `logger`
   - Fixed module imports for Node.js built-ins (dotenv, path) to use namespace imports
   - Implemented proper error handling with type checking
   - Rewrote copy functionality since BlobService doesn't have a copy method

2. Fixed import issues in `scripts/asset-migration/updateComingSoonCovers.ts`:
   - Corrected import paths from `../utils/logger` to `../../utils/logger`
   - Changed import from named import `{ logger as _logger }` to default import `logger`
   - Fixed module imports for Node.js built-ins (fs, path) to use namespace imports
   - Added proper error type handling in catch blocks

These changes ensure that both scripts can successfully compile without TypeScript errors. The default export pattern for the logger is more consistent with how it's used in the rest of the codebase.

## Next Steps

To complete T040, we need to:

1. Systematically audit other scripts for similar logger import issues
2. Create a consistent pattern for logger initialization across all scripts
3. Update all scripts with the correct logger references

This work should continue with a focus on standardizing the logger usage pattern across the codebase to prevent similar issues in the future.
