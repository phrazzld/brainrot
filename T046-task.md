## Title: Update asset imports and logger initialization across all scripts

## Original Ticket Text:
- [~] **T046: Update asset imports and logger initialization across all scripts**

  - [ ] Create standardized logger initialization pattern:
    - [ ] Define consistent approach for creating script-specific loggers
    - [ ] Add proper context and correlation IDs to all loggers
  - [ ] Fix asset service imports and initialization:
    - [ ] Update imports to use consistent path and naming
    - [ ] Ensure proper error handling during initialization
  - [ ] Dependencies: T040

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

This task involves standardizing two critical aspects of our scripts:

1. **Logger initialization**: We need to create a consistent pattern for initializing and using loggers across all script files. This includes:
   - Standardizing how we create loggers
   - Ensuring proper context and correlation IDs are added
   - Making error logging consistent

2. **Asset service imports and initialization**: We need to fix how asset services are imported and initialized across scripts:
   - Updating imports to use consistent paths
   - Ensuring proper error handling during initialization
   - Making the initialization pattern consistent

To approach this task effectively, I need to:

1. Analyze the current logger initialization patterns in various scripts
2. Analyze the current asset service import patterns
3. Design a standardized approach for logger initialization that provides proper context
4. Design a standardized approach for asset service initialization with proper error handling
5. Implement these patterns across all relevant script files
6. Test to ensure the changes don't break existing functionality

The goal is to reduce technical debt, make our codebase more maintainable, and ensure consistent error handling and logging across all scripts.
