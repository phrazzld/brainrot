# Vercel Blob Configuration Note

## Important Update

The `storage` property has been removed from `vercel.json` because it is not part of the valid schema for Vercel configuration files. Vercel Blob Storage is automatically configured through the Vercel dashboard and environment variables, not through `vercel.json`.

## Current Configuration

The current configuration relies on the following:

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`: Set in your project environment variables through the Vercel dashboard
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL`: Set in both your local `.env.local` file and in `vercel.json`'s `env` section

2. **Vercel Dashboard Setup**:
   - Blob Storage should be enabled through the Vercel dashboard for your project
   - This automatically configures the necessary storage settings

## Local Development

For local development, ensure you have the following in your `.env.local` file:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL=https://public.blob.vercel-storage.com
```

## Production Deployment

In production, Vercel Blob is configured automatically when you enable it in your project dashboard. You don't need to specify `storage` configuration in `vercel.json`.

The environment variables are still needed:

1. `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` should be set as an environment variable in your Vercel project settings
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL` is set in the `env` section of `vercel.json`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Blob storage:

1. Verify that Blob Storage is enabled in your Vercel project dashboard
2. Check that the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correctly set in your environment variables
3. Ensure your code is using the correct endpoint URLs
