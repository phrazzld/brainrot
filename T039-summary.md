# T039: Fix TypeScript Errors in Test Files

## Completed Changes

1. Fixed migrateFullAudiobooks.test.ts:

   - Added proper TypeScript interface for module imports
   - Implemented proper types for exec callbacks
   - Fixed StatSync mock implementations to use BigInt for file sizes
   - Added type annotations for AudiobookConfig objects
   - Updated mock implementations for fs.mkdirSync
   - Modified function signature in interface to match implementation
   - Fixed uploadFullAudiobook calls to include required bookSlug parameter

2. Fixed fetchTextWithFallback.test.ts:
   - Updated MockResponse class to better implement the Response interface
   - Fixed ArrayBuffer return type in arrayBuffer method
   - Used proper type casting for MockResponse to Response conversion
   - Updated import paths to use relative paths instead of aliases

These changes ensure that both test files pass TypeScript type checking, improving code quality and preventing type-related issues at runtime.

## Verification

Ran TypeScript type checking on both files using:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit __tests__/scripts/migrateFullAudiobooks.test.ts __tests__/utils/fetchTextWithFallback.test.ts
```

The files now pass TypeScript checking successfully. There are still other TypeScript errors in various files across the codebase, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks (T040-T050).

## Next Steps

- T040: Fix logger and module import errors in utility scripts
- T041: Fix type compatibility issues in verification scripts
- T042: Systematically update max-depth violations in search scripts
