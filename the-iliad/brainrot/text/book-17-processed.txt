then menelaus, that golden-tressed dude blessed by ares,
noticed how pat got rolled by trojans in the mosh pit.
he pushed straight up to front lines, all bronze-gleaming,
and circled round pat’s body like a mama bear
who just dropped her first cub, not used to the maternal vibe.
so menelaus paced around sweet dead pat,
long spear aimed forward, shield bracing wide,
basically telling any trojan, “try me if you dare.”

but euphorbus, the panthous kid with the fancy spear skills,
wasn’t about to let pat’s loot go unseen.
he swaggered close, calling out, “back off, atrides,
you can’t keep that corpse or those epic spoils.
i’m the mvp who tagged pat first—so scram,
or catch these lethal hands.”

menelaus flared up like “boy, get real,”
he remembered how euphorbus’s brother or cousin got wrecked before,
and he did that same savage deed again.
through euphorbus’s neck the spear soared,
bloodying those braids, gold-silver ringlets undone,
like some luscious olive branch ripped by a sudden gust,
so panthous’s son crashed, life scattering to dust.

menelaus stripped that gear, shining in kill-glow,
but apollo, shady in the trojan corner, was all,
“hector, you letting your homie die for nothing?
greek boy menelaus is stealing your thunder—
get in there, show some savage sauce.”

hector, helmet-shimmering, heard the shade and roared:
like a raging flame, he ran shrieking into the press.
golden menelaus saw the trojan war-lord storming in
and wrestled with his heart—does he hold pat’s body,
or dip before hector goes full psycho?
fate pulled him to stand, then giant ajax showed up,
shield big as a tower, right at menelaus’s flank.

the trojans came in waves, throats howling like winter wind
lashing the sea’s edge, but ajax is that unstoppable rock
where the tide breaks and shatters.
he stands over pat, menelaus at his side,
like two fierce herders shielding a fallen calf
while wolves circle hungrily in the gloom.

glaucus the lycian joined the meltdown,
chirping at hector: “man, i thought you were the trojan g.o.a.t.,
but look at you letting your guys get bodied.
you left sarpedon out cold, now you won’t even snatch pat—
what’s your deal?”

hector spat back, “glaucus, stfu, watch me work.”
rage in his chest, he strapped on the fresh armor
that once belonged to fast-footed achilles—
zeus peered down and whispered, “this fool’s wearing
the kit of a demigod—doom’s inbound,”
yet still gave him might for a minute.

meanwhile, the trojans and achaeans locked in sweaty madness,
dust soared so high it blacked out the sun,
and the center where pat’s body lay was pure meltdown:
spears squealing, men dropping, shrieks swirling thick as bees.
all around, lesser fighters scrapped in open daylight,
but the real hot zone was pat’s battered form,
like wolves ripping into the same piece of prey,
snarling, bloody, unstoppable.

achilles’s horses, off to the side, shed tears,
manes trailing in the dust, missing their sweet charioteer.
zeus pitied them: “i gave immortal stallions to mortal men—
what was i thinking?”
then a bit of divine oomph jolted them,
and they galloped back under automedon,
who swerved through trojans like a hawk scaring chickens,
but he couldn’t single-handedly spear them all—
driving the god-horses and fighting is tough solo.

finally alkimedon hopped in to hold the reins,
automedon gripped the spear, and they turned the tide
on hector, aeneas, plus their trojan homies.
still, wave after wave crashed in,
apollo fueling trojan hearts, athena boosting greek arms.
blood plastered the ground as men collapsed left and right.

menelaus snagged antilochus: “bro, hustle,
tell achilles that pat’s down, we need backup asap.”
antilochus froze with heartbreak, tears brimming,
but he sprinted off. menelaus hustled back to the scrum,
found ajax, that walking fortress,
and they anchored over pat’s limp form,
dragging him step by step toward the greek lines,
like mules hauling huge logs down a stony path—
sweat-soaked, unstoppable, hearts pounding.

the trojans wanted that corpse like it was prime loot:
they came shrieking, swirling, jabbing with spears,
till ajax whirled round, brandishing his massive shield,
and they recoiled like dogs from a raging boar,
scattering but never fully fleeing.

thus the day wore on under an iron sky:
both sides hammered each other, unstoppable as blazing fire,
the dust swirling so thick you’d swear night fell.
the greeks gritted their teeth, the trojans thirsted for kills,
pat’s body slowly inching back to the ships—
the epic meltdown set to shape all fates.
