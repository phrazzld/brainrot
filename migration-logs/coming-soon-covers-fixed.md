# Coming Soon Books Cover Fix Report

Date: January 17, 2025
Time: 11:41 AM PST

## Issue Summary

After the initial migration, coming soon book covers were showing 404 errors. Investigation revealed that:

1. The migration successfully moved images to `assets/{book-slug}/images/...` pattern
2. However, URLs were being generated with `books/{book-slug}/images/...` pattern
3. This was due to BlobPathService's `adaptAssetPath` method converting new format paths back to old format

## Root Cause

The `BlobPathService.adaptAssetPath` method was converting paths from the new format:
- `assets/the-divine-comedy-inferno/images/inferno-01.png`

To the old format:
- `books/the-divine-comedy-inferno/images/inferno-01.png`

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated asset path mapping** to include all coming soon book covers
2. **Modified `getAssetUrl` function** to detect and preserve new format paths
3. **Added special handling** for coming soon book image patterns

## Code Changes

### utils/assetPathMapping.ts
- Added mappings for all 13 coming soon book covers
- Fixed placeholder image path mapping

### utils/getBlobUrl.ts
- Added pattern matching to preserve new format asset paths
- Prevents BlobPathService from converting these paths to old format

## Verification Results

All 13 coming soon book covers are now accessible:
- ✓ pride-and-prejudice

## Files Modified

2. `/utils/getBlobUrl.ts` - Added pattern detection for new format paths
3. Created verification scripts to ensure all covers are accessible

## Status
