## Title: Refactor complex functions for maintainability

## Original Ticket Text:

- [~] **T023: Refactor complex functions for maintainability**
  - [ ] Reduce complexity of functions exceeding the limit of 10:
    - [ ] verifyCdnUrls.ts: verifyUrl (complexity: 24)
    - [ ] verifyCdnUrls.ts: parseCommandLineArgs (complexity: 31)
    - [ ] verifyCdnUrls.ts: formatResultsAsMarkdown (complexity: 20)
    - [ ] verifyCdnUrls.ts: formatComparisonReport (complexity: 34)
    - [ ] app/api/download/errorHandlers.ts: handleDownloadServiceError (complexity: 14)
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts: createProxyErrorResponse (complexity: 24)
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts: extractErrorDetails (complexity: 23)
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts: proxyAssetDownload (complexity: 35)
    - [ ] reorganize-blob-paths.ts: parseArgs (complexity: 16)
    - [ ] generateReorganizationPlan.ts: generateReorganizationPlan (complexity: 18)
    - [ ] utils/getBlobUrl.ts: generateBlobUrl (complexity: 14)
    - [ ] utils/getBlobUrl.ts: assetExistsInBlobStorage (complexity: 16)
    - [ ] services/downloadService.ts: getDownloadUrl (complexity: 12)
    - [ ] utils/validators/AssetNameValidator.ts: validateTextAssetName (complexity: 12)
  - [ ] Break down large files exceeding the 500 line limit:
    - [ ] reorganize-blob-paths.ts (516 lines)
    - [ ] translations/index.ts (949 lines)
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts (too many lines)
  - [ ] Reduce parameter count for functions with too many parameters:
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts: proxyAssetDownload (7 parameters)
  - [ ] Split large functions into smaller, more focused functions:
    - [ ] app/api/download/proxyService.ts: proxyAssetDownload (308 lines)
  - Dependencies: none

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

I need to analyze and refactor complex functions and large files to improve maintainability. This task follows the principles outlined in DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md, particularly focusing on simplicity, modularity, and readability.

For this analysis, I should:

1. Analyze each function/file to understand its purpose and current implementation
2. Identify strategies to reduce complexity:

   - Extract helper functions for reusable code blocks
   - Use composition over deep nesting
   - Implement early returns to reduce nesting
   - Group related operations into separate functions
   - Consider using strategy or command patterns for complex decision trees
   - Use functional programming techniques where appropriate

3. For large files:

   - Identify logical groups of functionality that can be separated
   - Create new modules for these groups
   - Ensure proper import/export relationships
   - Maintain or improve test coverage

4. For functions with too many parameters:

   - Consider using parameter objects or config objects
   - Evaluate if some parameters can be derived from others
   - Consider breaking the function into multiple smaller functions

5. Ensure all changes:
   - Maintain the same functionality and pass existing tests
   - Follow the TypeScript best practices in the development philosophy
   - Improve code readability and maintainability
   - Reduce cyclomatic complexity to acceptable levels

I should approach this methodically, focusing on one file/function at a time, and ensuring thorough testing after each refactoring.
