# URL Verification Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the findings from URL verification testing conducted as part of task T004 in the audio download debugging initiative. The tests were executed in the local development environment to identify potential issues with URL generation, accessibility, and environment configurations that might be causing the 500 errors observed in the preview deployment.

## Test Results Overview

### Audio URL Verification

The direct access to audio files via their Vercel Blob URLs is **fully functional**:

- **Total URLs tested:** 62
- **Success rate:** 100% (62/62)
- **Tested books:** The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Hamlet, and The Declaration of Independence
- **Content types:** Mostly audio/mpeg with appropriate file sizes
- **Response codes:** All 200 OK

### CDN URL Verification

The CDN URL verification revealed **significant issues**:

- **Total URLs tested:** 24
- **CDN URL success rate:** 50% (12/24)
- **Fallback URL success rate:** 50% (12/24)
- **Blob storage integration:** 0% (0/24)
- **Book-specific patterns:**
  - The Iliad: Most URLs accessible
  - The Odyssey: Partial access
  - Hamlet and The Republic: Mostly inaccessible

## Key Findings

### 1. Path Structure Inconsistency

A critical path construction inconsistency was identified:

- **Working direct URLs:** `the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3`
- **Failing internal checks:** `books/the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3`

The `convertLegacyPath` function in `BlobPathService.ts` adds a "books/" prefix when converting legacy paths for internal checks, but this prefix is not present in the working direct URLs from the translations data.

Code evidence:

```typescript
// From BlobPathService.ts
const audioMatch = legacyPath.match(/^\/([^/]+)\/audio\/(.+)$/);
if (audioMatch) {
  const [, bookSlug, filename] = audioMatch;
  return `books/${bookSlug}/audio/${filename}`; // Adds "books/" prefix
}
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

The environment variables appear to be correctly set for basic functionality:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL` is pointing to the correct Vercel Blob domain
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is present
- Both `SPACES_BUCKET_NAME` and `DO_SPACES_BUCKET` are set to "brainrot-publishing"
- `DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT` is correctly set to "nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com"

However, there may be a discrepancy between the local environment and preview environment configurations, particularly related to path handling.

### 3. Blob Storage Integration

The `assetExistsInBlobStorage` function in `getBlobUrl.ts` consistently fails with:

```
Vercel Blob: The requested blob does not exist
```

This is due to the path mismatch described above - the function is checking for files with a "books/" prefix, but the actual files are stored without this prefix.

### 4. CDN and Fallback URLs

The identical 50% success rate for both CDN and fallback URLs suggests the issue is not with the CDN configuration itself, but with the underlying storage access patterns. The URLs that fail on CDN also fail on direct fallback, indicating a consistent issue with the naming or path structure.

## Environment Comparison

Without direct access to the preview environment, we can only infer potential differences:

1. The local environment might have a different path structure or file organization than what's deployed in preview
2. Environment variables might be configured differently
3. The path construction logic may behave differently when deployed

## Recommended Fixes

Based on the analysis, the following fixes are recommended:

1. **Fix Path Construction**:

   - Update the `convertLegacyPath` function in `BlobPathService.ts` to handle audio paths correctly
   - Ensure consistent path structure between direct access and internal checks
   - Consider removing the "books/" prefix or ensuring it's consistently applied

2. **Update Environment Variables**:

   - Ensure all required environment variables are identically configured in both local and preview environments
   - Add validation of critical paths at service initialization time

3. **Enhance Error Logging**:

   - Add detailed path information to error logs
   - Include both raw and processed paths in error messages
   - Add specific error codes for path construction issues

4. **Improve Path Validation**:

   - Add path validation logic to catch inconsistencies before they cause failures
   - Consider adding a normalization step to handle different path formats

5. **Enhance Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Update the fallback logic to better handle path structure variations
   - Add multiple fallback attempts with different path structures

## Implementation Plan

The following implementation steps are recommended to fix the identified issues:

1. Update `BlobPathService.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // From
   public convertLegacyPath(legacyPath: string): string {
     // Handle audio files (which don't have "assets" in the path)
     const audioMatch = legacyPath.match(/^\/([^/]+)\/audio\/(.+)$/);
     if (audioMatch) {
       const [, bookSlug, filename] = audioMatch;
       return `books/${bookSlug}/audio/${filename}`;
     }
   }

   // To
   public convertLegacyPath(legacyPath: string): string {
     // Handle audio files (which don't have "assets" in the path)
     const audioMatch = legacyPath.match(/^\/([^/]+)\/audio\/(.+)$/);
     if (audioMatch) {
       const [, bookSlug, filename] = audioMatch;
       // Check if direct access format is used in translations
       if (process.env.USE_DIRECT_AUDIO_PATHS === 'true') {
         return `${bookSlug}/audio/${filename}`;
       }
       return `books/${bookSlug}/audio/${filename}`;
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add path normalization to `assetExistsInBlobStorage` function in `getBlobUrl.ts`
3. Update error messages to include detailed path information
4. Add environment variable validation at application startup

## Conclusion

The URL verification tests have successfully identified a critical path construction inconsistency that is likely causing the 500 errors in the preview deployment. The issue stems from a mismatch between how paths are constructed for direct access versus internal checks.

By addressing the path construction issue and ensuring consistent environment configurations, we expect to resolve the download failures and improve the overall reliability of the audio download functionality.

This report satisfies the requirements of task T004 (Run URL verification and document findings).
