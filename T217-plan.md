# T217 Plan: Execute Final Local Asset Cleanup

## Task Description
After 100% verification success, perform final cleanup by running `npx tsx scripts/cleanupLocalAssets.ts --delete --force` to remove all local assets.

## Approach

1. **Verify Current Blob Storage Status**
   - Run verification script to ensure all assets are properly migrated
   - Check for any remaining missing assets

2. **Review Cleanup Script**
   - Examine `cleanupLocalAssets.ts` to understand its functionality
   - Confirm the behavior of the `--delete` and `--force` flags

3. **Preparation**
   - Run the script first without the `--delete` flag to preview changes
   - Backup any important local assets if necessary

4. **Execution**
   - Run the script with `--delete --force` flags to perform the actual cleanup
   - Document the results and any issues encountered

5. **Verification**
   - Confirm that local assets have been properly removed
   - Ensure that the application still works correctly with assets served from Blob storage

## Implementation Steps

1. Run verification to ensure all assets are migrated: `npx tsx scripts/verifyBlobStorage.ts`
2. Run the cleanup script in dry-run mode: `npx tsx scripts/cleanupLocalAssets.ts`
3. Review the proposed deletions and confirm they are safe to delete
4. Execute the cleanup with force flag: `npx tsx scripts/cleanupLocalAssets.ts --delete --force`
5. Document the results and any issues in a completion report
6. Update the TODO.md file to mark the task as complete
