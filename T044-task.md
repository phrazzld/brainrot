## Task ID: T044

## Title: Standardize asset path utilities across scripts

## Original Ticket Text:

- [ ] **T044: Standardize asset path utilities across scripts**
  - [ ] Fix asset path utility inconsistencies:
    - [ ] Create consistent path handling utility for scripts
    - [ ] Ensure compatibility with both old and new path formats
    - [ ] Update all scripts to use standardized path utilities
  - [ ] Ensure proper path normalization for all asset types
  - [ ] Dependencies: none

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

We need to standardize how asset paths are handled across our scripts. Currently, there's inconsistency in how paths are constructed, normalized, and validated in different scripts. This leads to potential errors, maintenance difficulties, and confusion when working with the codebase.

To address this, we should:

1. Analyze the current asset path utilities used across scripts
2. Identify patterns and inconsistencies in path handling
3. Create a unified, maintainable approach for asset path operations
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing path formats
5. Update all scripts to use the standardized utilities

The solution should achieve the following goals:

- Consistent path handling across all scripts
- Compatibility with both old and new path formats
- Clear, well-documented API for path operations
- Proper path normalization for all asset types
- Type safety and error handling

The implementation should be guided by the principles in DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md, particularly focusing on simplicity, modularity, and explicitness.
