# Implementation Plan: Enforce Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in CI

## Overview
This implementation adds vulnerability scanning to the CI pipeline, causing builds to fail when high or critical severity vulnerabilities are detected in the project dependencies.

## Changes Made

1. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a complete CI pipeline
   - Included a dedicated step for vulnerability scanning

2. **Added Security Audit Script**
   - Added `security:audit` script to `package.json`
   - Configured to fail on high or critical severity vulnerabilities
   - Command: `npm audit --audit-level=high`

## How It Works

When a pull request is opened or changes are pushed to the master branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Check out the code
2. Set up Node.js
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting and tests
5. Execute the security audit
6. Build the project if all checks pass

If the security audit finds any high or critical severity vulnerabilities, the build will fail, preventing vulnerable code from being merged.

## Testing and Verification

1. The CI workflow can be tested by creating a test branch with a vulnerable dependency
2. The workflow should fail at the security audit step
3. Resolving the vulnerability or adding appropriate mitigations should allow the workflow to pass

## Future Improvements

1. Add more granular control with audit-level configuration in environment variables
2. Consider adding a security scanning badge to the README.md
3. Explore additional security scanning tools like Snyk or CodeQL
