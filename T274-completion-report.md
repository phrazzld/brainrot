# T274: Install Jest and React Testing Library - Completion Report

## Task Description
Install Jest and React Testing Library packages to enable testing for the project.

## Analysis
The project already has Jest and React Testing Library installed in package.json:
- jest (^29.7.0)
- @jest/globals (^29.7.0)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (^6.6.3)
- @testing-library/react (^15.0.7)
- jest-environment-jsdom (^29.7.0)
- ts-jest (^29.3.2)
- @types/jest (^29.5.12)

The testing infrastructure is partially configured:
- jest.config.cjs is set up for TypeScript support
- jest.setup.js has testing utilities and mocks
- npm scripts for testing are defined in package.json
- There are existing tests in __tests__/ directory
- The package.json has a note acknowledging React 19 compatibility issues with @testing-library/react

## Actions Taken
1. Verified existing testing dependencies in package.json
2. Analyzed the jest.config.cjs and jest.setup.js configuration
3. Examined existing test files to understand testing patterns
4. Tested the current setup with `npm test -- __tests__/utils/getBlobUrl.test.ts`
5. Confirmed that non-React tests are working correctly
6. Updated jest.config.cjs to improve React 19 compatibility:
   - Moved isolatedModules setting to the transform configuration
   - Added jsx: 'react-jsx' for React 19 support
   - Added testEnvironmentOptions.customExportConditions for ESM compatibility

## Results
1. ✅ Basic tests for utility functions are working correctly
2. ⚠️ React component tests are not working due to ESM and React 19 compatibility issues
3. ✅ The required packages are already installed and do not need to be reinstalled

## Next Steps
The next task "Configure Jest for TypeScript and Next.js" should focus on:
1. Resolving the React component testing issues with JSX transformation
2. Setting up proper ESM support for the project's module format
3. Addressing the warnings about deprecated configuration options
4. Ensuring full React 19 compatibility with the testing libraries
