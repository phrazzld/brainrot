# T054 Summary: Fix TypeScript Module Resolution Issues

## Overview

This task focused on resolving TypeScript module resolution issues across the codebase. The main issue was the need to add explicit `.js` extensions to ESM imports as required by the `NodeNext` module resolution strategy configured in our tsconfig.json.

## Changes Made

1. **Added explicit .js extensions to imports**:

   - Updated several test files to use proper ES module imports with .js extensions
   - Fixed imports in utility files like `utils/getBlobUrl.ts`
   - Updated service index file to use .js extensions in exports

2. **Fixed ArrayBuffer type compatibility in MockResponse.ts**:

   - Changed `ArrayBuffer` to `ArrayBufferLike` for better type compatibility
   - Added proper type checking for typed arrays with ArrayBuffer
   - Implemented better handling of ArrayBuffer.isView() for Blob conversions

3. **Improved type safety in VercelBlobAssetService.ts**:

   - Fixed the type compatibility issue with `ListBlobResultBlob`
   - Added proper typing for the `uploadedAt` field to accept both Date and string
   - Used a safer two-step type assertion with `unknown` as an intermediate type

4. **Fixed path alias usage**:

   - Updated `utils/validators/AssetNameValidator.ts` to use relative imports instead of path aliases
   - Ensured consistent import patterns across related files

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation for module resolution patterns in `docs/MODULE_RESOLUTION.md`
   - Included examples of correct import patterns
   - Documented common issues and their solutions
   - Added information about Jest configuration for module resolution

## Remaining Work

Many files still need explicit `.js` extensions added to their imports. This will require a systematic approach to:

1. Add explicit `.js` extensions to all internal module imports
2. Fix path aliases throughout the codebase
3. Ensure type compatibility with external modules
4. Run TypeScript compiler checks to verify all module resolution issues are fixed

## Recommendations

1. Consider using a codemod or automated script to add the `.js` extensions to all imports
2. Update ESLint rules to enforce consistent import patterns
3. Include module resolution guidelines in developer onboarding documentation
4. Add pre-commit hooks to verify module resolution correctness

## Conclusion

This task has established the groundwork for properly resolving TypeScript module issues. The changes made demonstrate the correct patterns to follow, but a more comprehensive update will be needed to address all import statements across the codebase.
