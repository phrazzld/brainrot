# T279: Fix Jest Configuration for React 19 Components

## Task Description
Update the Jest configuration to properly handle React 19 component tests, focusing on fixing the failing DownloadButton.test.tsx tests.

## Analysis
Based on the failing tests, we have issues with:
1. React component tests failing to render properly with messages like "Unable to find an element with the text..."
2. The DownloadButton.test.tsx file specifically has multiple failures

## Current State
From the PR output, the tests are failing because the components aren't rendering properly. This could be due to:
- JSX transformation issues
- React 19 compatibility problems
- JSDOM configuration issues
- Mock setup problems

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Examine Failing Tests
- Analyze the DownloadButton.test.tsx file to understand its implementation
- Identify specific rendering issues and error patterns

### 2. Inspect Current Jest Configuration
- Review jest.config.cjs
- Review jest-babel-transformer.cjs
- Review jest.setup.cjs

### 3. Fix Component Test Rendering
- Update JSX transformations for React 19 compatibility
- Fix the custom render function in DownloadButton.test.tsx
- Ensure proper test environment configuration

### 4. Test and Verify
- Run the failing tests to confirm fixes
- Ensure no regressions in other tests

### 5. Documentation
- Update any relevant documentation
- Document the fixes for future reference

## Implementation Approach
This appears to be a focused configuration issue that can be solved with targeted updates to the test configuration and possibly the component test file itself. The approach will be:
1. Small, targeted changes to jest-babel-transformer.cjs
2. Potential updates to DownloadButton.test.tsx test setup
3. Verification with specific test runs before running the full suite
