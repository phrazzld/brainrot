# T270: Create .prettierrc.js with code formatting standards - Completion Report

## Summary

Created a comprehensive `.prettierrc.js` configuration file with appropriate code formatting standards for the project. The configuration is designed to work well with the existing ESLint setup and follows best practices for Next.js/TypeScript projects.

## Actions Taken

1. **Analyzed existing code style**
   - Examined project files to understand the current code style conventions
   - Identified patterns for indentation, quotes, line length, etc.

2. **Reviewed ESLint configuration**
   - Analyzed `.eslintrc.json` to ensure Prettier configuration would be compatible
   - Noted rule configurations that might interact with Prettier

3. **Created .prettierrc.js**
   - Used JavaScript format for configuration to allow comments
   - Added detailed documentation about the purpose of each setting
   - Configured formatting rules aligned with the observed project style:
     - 100 character line length
     - 2 spaces for indentation
     - Single quotes for JavaScript, double quotes for JSX
     - Trailing commas in ES5 compatible locations
     - LF line endings for consistency

4. **Added specialized configuration**
   - Set up file-specific overrides for different file types
   - Added import order rules to keep imports organized
   - Configured TypeScript-specific parser options

## Results

The created `.prettierrc.js` configuration file defines consistent formatting standards for the project that:

1. Align with industry best practices for Next.js and TypeScript projects
2. Work harmoniously with the existing ESLint configuration
3. Match the observed code style in the codebase
4. Are well-documented for future maintenance

The configuration provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and consistency as the project evolves.
