yap, muse, spin the tea ’bout our boi odysseus
who was big sad and big tough, the literal main dude:
when princess nausicaa sped off with the donkey-team drip,
he prayed up, stranded as fuck, then followed her into the city, no cap.

the donkey squad carried home that top-tier princess,
rollin’ up to her pops’ palace on phaeacian turf,
her bros—shiny as gods—unloaded the gear and stashed them threads,
while the girl glided off to her sweet bedroom,
where granny eury-medousa, some legit og from apeire,
kept the fires lit. this old bestie got carried here ages ago,
claimed by king alcinous (who basically runs the show,
the phaeacians worship him like a minor deity, for real).
she took care of naive nausicaa since day one,
and right now, she’s hooking up the nighttime vibe with plenty dinner.

meanwhile, cunning odysseus rose from that watery meltdown,
athena (that fierce-eyed goddess, our wingwoman forever)
draped him in thick stealth-aura so the locals wouldn’t troll him—
phaeacians ain’t exactly hype about random drifters, bruh.
she was like, “bestie, keep it hush, follow me, no big yikes from the crowd.
these folks don’t vibe with strangers like that; they trust their baller ships,
gifted by the sea-lord poseidon, swift as a thought or a gull’s wing.”

then off she strutted, disguised as a boujee teenage sis,
while oh-dee trotted behind in the goddess’s footprints,
invisible to the big-ego phaeacians, thanks to that oh-so-thick goddess fog.
dude was lowkey shook by their epic ports, the next-level ships,
and the fancy boulevards, high walls bristling with palisades—
total “sheesh” moment.

finally, they reached king alcinous’s bomb palace,
and bright-eyed athena teased, “hey father-like stranger,
feast your eyes: this is the crib you asked about,
where big boss alcinous and the other shot-callers feast.
get in there, be bold, bestie—fear’s mid as fuck.
if you vibe with queen arete, the white-armed real one,
she might rizz you up with help to get back home.
she’s top-tier, not just a basic housewife.
her name’s a major w among these people, revered like some goddess.
everyone worships her, from her kids to the lord husband alcinous,
and the entire squad sees her as a queen indeed.
when she strolls the city, they treat her like an icon, no cap.
she’s wise for real, sorting out beef and drama like a pro.
if she stans you, bet you’ll get back to your ends,
see your squad again, and drop anchor on your home turf.”

then athena dipped across the wine-dark sea,
heading back to marathon and wide-ways athens,
straight into erechtheus’s fortress to mind her own.
but odysseus took a deep breath at alcinous’s palace doors,
feeling major adrenaline pumping before stepping on that brazen threshold.

yo, that palace, though—lowkey shining like the sun or moon,
with walls of bronze and a fancy blue frieze up top:
the doors straight gold, the doorposts silver on a bronze floor,
silver lintel, gold décor—like, it’s giving *ultimate wealth*.
hepheastus himself forged two metal guard dogs, gold ‘n silver,
posted at the entrance forever, no aging, no dying, always lit.
the hall had seats lined around the walls from front to back,
heaped with plush blankets, embroidered with big skillz,
where phaeacian royal homies lounged, sipping wine and munching
24/7, because that’s just how they roll.
golden boi statues stood by the altars with blazing torches,
keeping the night vibin’ for the diners.

fifty maids worked inside, some grinding grain at the mills,
others spinning yarn like pros, weaving that gorgeous cloth
that literally drips with oil—like major skill issue for the rest of us.
phaeacian men are unstoppable at steering their lit ships;
phaeacian women are unstoppable at weaving that high-key fabric.
athena gave them mad weaving prowess, plus big brains.

outside near the doors, there’s a dope orchard four acres wide,
ringed by a slick fence: pears, pomegranates, orchard apples,
figs, and olives, all thriving year-round no matter the season—
the west wind keeps them popping off, so fruit always glows up:
a pear ages on the branch while another is just blossoming,
grapes on grapes, figs on figs, it’s a continuous spree.
there’s a well-tilled vineyard with clusters in every stage—some ripening,
some folks picking, some pressed, some turning from green to purple.
flower beds line the orchard’s edge, overflowing with color,
and two legit springs flow: one watering the entire orchard,
the other shoots under the courtyard into the big house,
so the people fill up their jugs inside.
straight up, that’s the palace of alcinous: insane flex, yeah?

our boy odysseus stood in awe, starstruck by all the boujee vibes.
then he stepped in, hidden in athena’s hush-cloud.
he saw the phaeacian chieftains finishing a parting libation to hermes,
about to crash for the night.
he slid across the hall under that goddess cloak,
till he reached queen arete and king alcinous up front.
he threw himself at arete’s knees (fog lifting on the spot, oh snap!),
everyone gasped in silent wtf, eyeballing this random mortal.
he spoke up, tears on deck:

“arete, daughter of the noble rhyxeanor,
i crash here battered by major heartbreak and L’s.
please, i beg you, and your spouse, and these squads:
may the gods bless y’all with glow-ups, keep your fortunes stacked,
let you pass on the vibes to your kids.
but help me secure a safe uber back to my homeland, i’m begging.
it’s been a hot minute since i parted my loved ones,
and i’m fully exhausted, for real.”

then he slumped by the hearth in the dust, big sad.
all stayed silent. finally, old echenius, oldest phaeacian og,
broke the hush:
“alcinous, c’mon, bruh, this is not a good look.
the stranger’s in the ashes at the fireplace, big cringe.
raise him up, seat him among us, let’s give him wine for zeus’s sake,
zeus is big on folks who humbly show up.
then let’s feed him—no one leaves a visitor hungry, that’s out of pocket.”

king alcinous nodded, grabbed odysseus’s hand,
raised him from the ash and parked him on a shining seat,
pushing aside his own fave son laodamas to make space—
that’s how much he stanned the newcomer.
a maid poured water from a golden jug over a silver basin,
letting him wash, then spread a table with bread and fixings.
our boi odysseus devoured that feast with zero shame.

alcinous told the herald pontonoos,
“fam, mix the wine and pass the cup around,
so we can do a final pour for thunder-lord zeus,
the caretaker of all sorrowful travelers.”

the herald poured sweet wine for each of them in turn;
they sipped their fill, and alcinous laid it down:
“listen up, phaeacians, let’s do the rational thing:
we’ll feast now then dip home, but tomorrow morning,
we gather more elders, host this dude properly,
and schedule his escort back, because that’s how we do—
no man in our crew’s left behind,
the gods forbid he suffer more at sea before stepping foot in his homeland.
still, if the fate-weavers have more drama in store for him, that’s between him and destiny,
but we’ll do our part.
if by chance he’s one of the immortals come down from olympus,
they gotta let us know. we see gods in the open all the time, no cap:
they show up to our feasts, and we’re basically neighbors.
we’re not like the savage cyclopes or the giant tribes.”

quick-witted odysseus jumped in:
“bro, i am so not a god—i’m a mere mortal battered by heartbreak.
trust me, i got that main character suffering.
just feed me, let me rest my rotting brain,
’cause real talk, hunger is savage—it’ll make you forget your sorrow
until your belly’s stuffed. that’s me: i got major trauma, but i still gotta eat.
tomorrow, do your thing, gather the squad, fix me a ride back.
let me at least see my crib, my fam, my own domain one more time.”

everyone co-signed that vibe. once they’d poured and guzzled enough,
they each dipped out to their own cribs.
odysseus lingered in the hall with godlike alcinous and queen arete,
while servants cleared the remains of the feast.
white-armed arete noticed the cloak and tunic he wore—her own creations,
crafted by her ladies. so she asked,
“so, stranger, let me get the deets: who are you, from where,
and who gave you these clothes if you claim you drifted in from the sea?”

odysseus, wily as ever, was like,
“queen, that’s a loaded question. i’ll try to keep it 100 though i’ve been put through the wringer by the olympian gods.
there’s an island called ogygia, home to calypso with the wavy hair,
a real goddess, cunning too—she basically got me stranded there solo
after zeus wrecked my crew’s ship in the black sea.
all my homies drowned, i clung to the keel, drifting nine days,
till i washed up on her beach. she took me in,
promised me immortality, but i was too homesick, big tears.
i stayed stuck for seven years, crying into them fancy clothes she’d give me.
on the eighth, she finally said, ‘okay, off you go,’ apparently zeus had spoken.
she set me up on a raft, loaded me with food and dope gear,
sent me off with a gentle breeze. i cruised for seventeen days
till i glimpsed your hood, and i was hype, but poseidon said, ‘lol, no.’
he whipped up a savage storm, shredded my raft, so i had to freestyle swim
till i found your river mouth, a calmer spot. i crawled ashore,
hid in the bushes, crashed hard in leaf piles all night, dead tired.
next day, your daughter—shining like a goddess—rolled up with her squad.
she gave me bread, glistening wine, and these clothes, plus a wash,
though i was spooked to follow her to your city in case you caught vibes.
that’s the real story, on the gods.”

alcinous replied, “dang, so my daughter should’ve brought you here with her ladies,
but i’m not gonna roast her too hard. she probably worried i’d be pressed.
young folks can be sussy about how dads react.”

odysseus answered, “bro, don’t shade your princess—
she invited me to roll, but i was anxious you might be triggered,
you know how humans can be big jealous. better i come solo.”

alcinous gave a big nod, “chill, i’m not that petty.
if you were down to stay, i’d give you my child’s hand,
set you up with a house and farmland, but i guess you’re too homesick.
no one’s forcing you. tomorrow, i vow i’ll have ships and squad ready.
you’ll ride in comfy oblivion till you land in your fatherland,
even if it’s far as euboea, our rumored farthest stop.
our peeps once took golden rhadamanthus there in one day, no sweat.
then they came back with zero stress. that’s how fire our fleets are—
you’ll see for yourself how we yeet across the waves.”

odysseus was mega grateful, prayed, “father zeus,
may all alcinous promised come true,
so his name glows in the wide earth, and i can finally get home.”

they chatted, and white-armed arete told her maids:
“set up a comfy bed under the echoing portico,
throw some dope purple blankets, rugs, and big warm fleeces on top.”
the maids hustled out with torches, quickly making his new bed.
then they called odysseus, “hey boi, your bed’s all decked out—
time to pass out.”

which he did, so grateful to crash after all that drama.
thus wily odysseus dozed off in a carved bed
under the roarin’ hall of alcinous,
while the king himself turned in deeper inside with his queen,
and that’s how the day ended, no cap.
