yap at me muse, about this guy who was lowkey built different,
who literally couldn't stay in his lane after he absolutely demolished troy for real for real:
he was out here vibing in everybody's cities, living in their heads rent-free,
not gonna lie he was catching major l's on the ocean, straight up in his feels,
trying to keep himself and his squad alive and heading back to base.
but no cap, he couldn't save his boys even though he was trying so hard:
they were out here acting real smooth-brained and did themselves dirty,
absolute en-pee-sees who had the audacity to feast on helios's cattle—
and he said "bet" and canceled their whole return journey.
spill the tea about all this, divine bestie, zeus's daughter, we're all ears.

all the other mains who didn't get rekt
were chilling at home, having dipped from the war and ocean situation:
but my guy was stuck in his villain era, no wifey, no home,
'cause this baddie calypso (she's literally a goddess bee-tee dubbs) had him on lock
in her cave, down bad trying to get him to put a ring on it.
but when the time finally came around in this whole seasonal rotation,
when the gods were like "aight, let him head back to his crib
in ithaca"—but he was still catching hands even there,
even with his day ones. all the gods were like "free my man,"
except poseidon was big mad, no chill,
beefing with god-tier odysseus before he could pull up to his ends.

but right now he was posted up with the ethiopians in their faraway spot,
(they're like split in two groups bee-tee dubbs, absolute edge of the map type energy),
some where the sun dips, others where it does its little morning slay,
collecting his w in the form of mad bulls and sheep.
man's was living his best life at the function, meanwhile all the other gods
were having a whole vibe check up in zeus's crib on olympus.
that's when the goat of gods and humans started spitting facts:
'cause he was thinking about that guy aegisthus (absolute w person bee-tee dubbs),
who got unalived by orestes (agamemnon's son, kind of a big deal):
thinking about all that, he started throwing shade to the immortal squad:

“mortals be blaming us for their messy drama,” he goes, “but no lie,
they're out here playing themselves with clown moves. aegisthus got a heads-up—
hermes literally slid into his dms like ‘don’t smash agamemnon’s bae,
or you’ll get canceled by the son, orestes.’ did he listen? luh-mao no.”

athena, big-brain baddie with the glowy eyes, is like:
“you spittin, father, but about my boy odysseus? he's suffering big time,
stranded on that lush island with calypso thirsting after him.
he’s too based to accept a ring from her, but she won’t release him.
like, he gave you so many good sacrifices in troy, how you gonna ghost him?”

zeus retorts: “dang, child, i’d never forget that icon.
dude’s super cunning, always hooking us up with lit offerings.
but poseidon's in his feelings 'cause oh-dee poked out the cyclops polyphemus’s eye—
and that’s poseidon’s own spawn, so the salt runs deep.
still, big p can’t stand against all of us. let’s do a solid and help oh-dee home.”

athena’s like “say less, i’ll do my cameo in ithaca.
but first, i’ll dm hermes to handle calypso, make her unhand my boy.
i’ll go hype telemachus, spark that backbone, so he can corral the suitors,
and maybe even dip for intel in pylos and sparta. hopefully he learns dad’s fate.”

she laces her golden goddess kicks, the ones that whisk her across land and sea,
grabs her savage spear that can wreck entire squads,
then swoops down from olympus, pulling up at odysseus’s front gate
disguised as mentes, king of the taphian vibes.

inside, the suitors lounge like they own the place,
chomping succulent beef, chugging wine by the gold cup.
telemachus, posted among them but big sad about dad, spots athena first.
he meets her at the threshold, nervous 'bout a stranger eavesdropping.
he offers her a seat, tries to keep it classy so the suitors don’t annoy her.

a maid brings water in a fancy jug, sets up a drip table of bread and meats.
they pass the wine, and telemachus quietly asks:
“where you from, bestie, and what’s the mission?
these seas aren’t that safe for random walk-ins. how’d you even land here?”

athena, in disguise, goes: “name’s mentes, i’m from taphos, we love our oars.
i parked my boat at reithron cove under that wooded slope,
heard rumors your dad might be back, but guess that’s not the vibe.
still, i sense oh-dee’s not gone. i bet he’s stuck with savage folks.
now, are you for real his kid? you got that same cunning glow.”

telemachus sighs: “my mom swears i’m his, but no father to confirm.
all i got is a house full of clown suitors draining my stash,
acting like dad’s never coming back. it’s a bad time, big stress.”

athena feels that pity: “ugh, i wish your father would just pull up with that old armor,
the same heroic energy i remember from back in the day.
he’d body these suitors like no tomorrow. but we might have to run a scheme ourselves.
tomorrow, call an assembly, tell these moochers to skedaddle.
if your mom’s down to remarry, let her father handle that.
meanwhile, you snag a boat and bounce to pylos, then sparta,
interview nestor and menelaus for the four-one-one on your pops.
if they say he’s living, keep faith. if he’s toast,
set up the funeral to give him a proper send-off, then handle these suitors with savage cunning.
remember orestes? he took out the clown who killed his dad.
time for you to be alpha, tele. i see potential in you, no cap.”

athena dips, transforming into a bird. telemachus is shook,
realizing it was a goddess cameo. he returns to the suitors,
who are vibing to phêmios’s sad jam about trojan homecomings.

penelope hears and is big sad from her room.
she comes down with her maids, begs the bard, “please pick another jam;
this one slaps too hard on my feels for oh-dee.”

telemachus steps in: “mom, let the bard be. lots of dudes died in troy, not just dad.
plus, i run these halls now—back to your loom, bestie.”
stunned at his new energy, she heads back upstairs, crying for oh-dee,
till athena sprinkles sweet sleep on her eyes.

the suitors keep turning up, each wanting penelope in his bed,
but telemachus calls them out: “drink up for now, but tomorrow we talk.
y’all gon’ either bounce or i’ll call the big gods on your trifling.”

they side-eye him, but realize he’s not playing.
antinous tries to mock him; tele laughs in his face, unbothered.
eurymachus asks about the random visitor, who peaced out so quick.
tele says, “just a friend, mentes from taphos, i guess. eye-dee-kay.
maybe not.” he suspects it was a goddess, but keeps it hush.

the suitors party till late, then shuffle off to their cribs.
telemachus heads to his big bougie bedroom, mind spinning with epic plans.
old nurse eurycleia lights his way—she practically raised him.
he strips off his robe, she folds it up, and heads out,
locking the door behind her. telemachus nestles under a fleecy blanket,
plotting how to realize the hype that athena planted in his soul.
