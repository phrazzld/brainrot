yap to me, muse of savage retorts, and tell how odysseus,
camouflaged in that dusty old-beggar drip, climbed the rough backroads
through the forested scruff of ithaca’s heights, to find
the swineherd eumaeus—man so faithful, he watched his absent king’s pigs
like a dad scouring the horizon for lost kids.

there in the front yard, eumaeus perched outside a tall wooden fence,
hedged by big stones and wild brush, the yard ringed all around—
he’d built it himself, this prime pig-haven, while lord odysseus roamed,
while penelope wept, and laertes slumped in old-man gloom.
twelve pig-pens inside, each teeming with fifty mother-hogs,
the boars kept outside, though suitors chomped them day after day—
fattened prime pork served up in the palace halls.
four dogs roamed, fierce enough to chase down predators on sight.
in that moment, the dogs spotted odysseus skulking near the fence.
they sprang, yapping, fangs bared, ready to shred.
odysseus hunkered, staff dropped from his hand,
about to catch a savage L right in his own backyard—
but eumaeus sprinted like a track star, flinging rocks at the dogs,
yelling them off: “outta here!” scattering them.
he apologized, “old man, i about let you get mauled—
my heart’s weighed down missing my lord,
and i’m stuck fattening pigs for worthless suitors,
while he’s probably drifting on some foreign shore if he’s even alive.
c’mon in though, get that bread and wine, we’ll talk about your story,
who you are, what pains you’ve seen.”

he led the disguised king in, laid him a thick wild-goat pelt,
soft brush beneath, warm and welcoming,
and odysseus’s heart glowed at the swineherd’s kindness:
“zeus bless you, friend, for reals,” he said,
and eumaeus, with that humble vibe, replied:
“yo stranger, it’s sin to disrespect a guest, no matter what.
zeus and the gods watch over all beggars and wanderers.
i’m just a slave, spooked by the young lords who run the roost.
if only my real king, odysseus, came back, i’d be set—
he gave me a home, a living, honored me like family.
but that war took him, the war for helen that scoured so many.
he followed agamemnon to troy, never came back.
dang that woman’s face, it’s undone half the heroes in greece…”

then the swineherd hustled out to pick two prime hogs, butchered them swiftly,
roasted the meat on spits, dusted it with flour, served it to his guest,
all the while cursing the suitors who gorged themselves daily
on the best of odysseus’s herds.
“they have no fear of the gods or rumor of vengeance,” eumaeus said,
“just devouring everything. they sacrifice a bunch of livestock,
draining that cellar of wine. odysseus was rich asf, no lie,
with twelve cattle herds on the mainland, flocks of sheep, goats, swine—
so many watchers, each day they pick the prime beast to feed themselves.
i just do my job, but it’s heartbreaking.”

odysseus ate in silence, letting eumaeus vent.
after dinner, eumaeus poured him more sweet wine,
and asked, “so, old man, who are you, what’s your story?
where’s your city, who shipped you here to ithaca?
’cause i doubt you walked on water.”

odysseus spun a wild backstory, claiming cretan birth,
son of a wealthy man, with half-brothers from a legit wife,
while he was the child of a slave, but still beloved.
he boasted about leading raiding parties, plundering with unstoppable confidence,
until the trojan war snapped his fortunes.
afterwards, he wandered to egypt, where his crew messed up,
pillaging towns, forcing him to beg the egyptian king for mercy.
he lived there seven years, stacked wealth, then got tricked by a shady phoenician,
shipwrecked by zeus’s thunder.
he drifted to thesprotia, found by king pheidon,
heard news of odysseus—swore the man was alive and loaded,
about to return from dodona, where he’d sought zeus’s advice from the sacred oak.
then some other shady crew tried to enslave him again, but he escaped,
ending up naked on ithaca’s shore, alone, battered.

eumaeus listened, shook his head, disbelieving:
“that’s quite a tale, old man, but mention odysseus? c’mon.
we get drifters lying about him all the time.
our queen weeps and begs for any crumb of hope,
and scammers feed her fake news for a hot meal and some clothes.
truth is, dogs or fish probably have picked his bones clean.
he’s gone, leaving grief for everyone, me especially—he was the best master ever.
i hate hearing random travelers name-drop him.”

odysseus insisted on an oath: “he’s returning, i swear by zeus,
within the turning of the moon, and he’ll avenge the disrespect.”
eumaeus balked: “yeah, yeah, i’m done with prophecies. but sure, if he came,
i’d celebrate. penelope, laertes, telemachus, we’d all go hype.
but i got bigger worries: telemachus is out chasing rumors,
and the suitors plan to murder him on his way back,
erasing the line of odysseus once and for all.
but enough: let’s talk your troubles.
tell me in truth how you got here, and i’ll feed you well.”

odysseus repeated his cretan-lie saga in deeper detail,
chronicling storms, forced voyages, cunning escapes,
the usual disclaimers about war and fate—
all to test the swineherd, see if he’d keep showing mercy.

eumaeus shrugged, “man, you spin some crazy yarn,
but i don’t buy that part about odysseus. i’ve been fooled before.
but i’ll still treat you well—for zeus’s sake, not because i believe your hype.”

the disguised hero said, “you’re a suspicious soul, but i stand by it.
odysseus will come, and if i’m lying, toss me off a cliff.
fair enough?” eumaeus snorted. “i wouldn’t kill a guest i’ve fed—
that’s some cursed vibe. let’s drop it, have supper,
the rest of my buddies should be back soon with the hogs.”

indeed, the pigmen rolled in, corralling sows,
and eumaeus picked out a thick five-year hog to feast the hungry men,
offering a tuft of bristles in prayer to all the gods
that odysseus might return.
then he slaughtered it, portioned out the juicy cuts,
gave odysseus the honor chunk to show his secret devotion to that missing king.
odysseus thanked him: “may zeus bless you for this kindness.”
eumaeus just said, “eat up, stranger, i do what i can.
the gods decide who gets what. i’m just a mortal.”

they ate and drank, while mesaulios, a slave eumaeus bought by himself,
doled out more bread.
afterwards, belly full, odysseus tested the swineherd again,
spinning a new mini-tale about freezing nights in troy,
some cunning ploy where menelaus and odysseus provided him with a cloak.
he basically hinted: “dang, i’m cold. mind sparing a blanket?”

eumaeus read the subtext: “shrewd story, old man.
sadly, we have no extra cloaks. each of my men has only one.
but i’ll rig you a cozy bed near the fire and toss you a big spare cloak.
when telemachus comes, he’ll give you proper clothes.”

so eumaeus layered a bunch of goat- and sheep-skins near the blaze,
spread a thick cloak for him, and odysseus, half-dead with exhaustion,
blessed the swineherd in his heart for such kindness.
as for eumaeus himself, no rest.
he strapped on his sword, threw on a thick winter-proof cloak,
grabbed a strong spear, and stepped outside into the whistling night wind,
to bunk with the sharp-tusked swine under a rock-shelter,
protecting them from wolves or thieves, a faithful steward till dawn.

such was the night’s end in eumaeus’s rustic yard,
where old odysseus, cunning and patient, found safe harbor
and laid the seeds of his suitors’ day of doom.
