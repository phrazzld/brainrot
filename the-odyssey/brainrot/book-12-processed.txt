so when our ship yeeted outta ocean’s flow
and we slid onto aiaia’s lit beach, circe’s hood,
(where dawn’s crib all glows pink and sunrise hits us with that "slay")
we dragged that boat onto the sand and hopped off for a sec,
lowkey exhausted as fuck, just waiting for the next day to rise.

when that rosy-fingered dawn (for real, she’s always serving looks)
finally popped off, i told my squad, “hey, we gotta bury elpenor—
our homie who legit took an l earlier.”
we cut some wood on the cliff side, let the tears fall big yikes,
and gave him that funeral glow-up, building a mound and sticking up his oar
’cause he may have been an en-pee-see sometimes, but was still our guy.

then circe, who’s basically the ultimate baddie goddess, didn't ghost us.
she came flexing with her handmaids, bringing a feast that was kinda bussin—
tons of meats, sweet wine, you name it, that platter was big drip.
standing right in the middle, she was like,
“dang y’all are savage, pulling up from hades alive? be fucking for real.
mortals usually only die *once*, but you guys did a whole dlc.
but hey, chow down, take your w, and tomorrow morning,
i’ll drop hints for your route home so you don’t do anything smooth-brained
and end up in some savage meltdown at sea or on land.”

bet. we feasted till the sunset glowed purple,
and when dark fell, the bros crashed near the stern,
while queen circe pulled me aside by the hand—she had that thirst, bestie.
she made me spill every detail, so i gave her the lowdown.
then she spilled more goddess-tier tea:

“listen up, my guy, i’ll keep it 100:
first you gotta pass them sirens, major op vibes.
they’ll try to snatch your ears with their boujee singing,
all melty and seductive, so if any smooth-brain hears that track,
they never see the wifey and kiddos again—
straight up skeleton central on their coastline,
where broken bones fade into the salty breeze.
so the move? plug your crew’s ears with wax so they can’t vibe
to the sirens’ bops. if *you* still finna hear them for the lulz,
they gotta strap you upright to the mast, real talk.
if you start beggin’ to be freed, they gotta tie you down even harder, bro.
that’s a pro-tip from your fave goddess.

once you swerve them sirens, it gets complicated,
'cause you got these next-level hazards: them wandering rocks, or else scylla and charybdis.
the wandering rocks are basically a no-go—birds and ships get rekt, no survivors,
except that super legendary argo once—some hera hack, i guess.

but scylla and charybdis, they’re the biggest ops.
on one side stands a monstrous cliff up in the clouds, always storm-wrapped.
no mortal can scale that—straight up vertical, polished like marble.
halfway up, a dank cave angled to the gloom, that’s scylla’s hideout.
she’s a horrifying queen of the jump-scare, with six heads, each row of teeth legit nightmare fuel.
she snatches whatever’s passing, dragging them off shrieking.
your besties can’t 1v1 this—it’s a guaranteed l.
on the other side is charybdis, slurping the entire sea thrice a day, spitting it back thrice a day.
if you’re caught in her swirl, you’re basically donezo. not even poseidon can bail you out, for real.
so better to skirt scylla’s zone and accept maybe losing six homies
instead of your entire squad and ship in the big flush.

also, watch out for the sun god’s place, thrinacia.
his cattle and sheep? top-tier, thriving with no downtime, guarded by two goddess nymphs, lampetie and phaethousa.
if you keep your mitts off them, you might actually get home scuffed but breathing.
if you do them dirty and chow his sacred herd, that’s an instant fail:
your boat’s a goner, your men too, and you’ll only get home alone, super delayed.
that’s the vibe, bestie.”

that’s how circe ended her savage briefing. then dawn in her normal pink glam turned up,
and the goddess ghosted away from the island. i told my boys to hop onboard,
unloose the stern ropes, and let’s bounce.
circe, big pookie energy, sent a solid tailwind that made the sails sing.
so we kicked back, trusting the helmsman to vibe the route.

then i spilled the hot gossip to the squad: “yo, besties,
circe gave me all the cheat codes. let’s not keep secrets.
we about to pass the sirens, and we can’t let that singing do us dirty.
y’all gotta fill your ears with wax, but if i thirst to hear them, tie me up. no cap.”

they said “bet,” and soon we approached that siren zone.
the wind hushed, waves died, some deity do be meddling.
the bros lowered sails, took up oars, i molded wax with bronze warmed by helios’s fiery vibes,
then plugged each ear. they also tied me to the mast real secure,
and got to rowing that sea like their lives depended on it (which, not gonna lie, it did).

yo, the sirens noticed us creeping, so they unleashed that track:
“odysseus, big goat energy among achaeans,
come through, bestie, park that ship, get these vibes.
nobody sails past us without copping pure knowledge of trojan war lore,
and everything else on the planet. you’ll be so based if you chill with us.”

not gonna lie, i was lowkey simping for their melody, giving my crew the universal “free me” sign with my eyebrows,
but they pulled the big no and just strapped me tighter.
only when we left their zone and no more vibes drifted over the waves
did they pop the wax out and unbind me.

but then we saw smoke and heard monstrous waves roaring up ahead.
everyone freaked, oars flew from their hands, the boat just drifted.
i walked through them with a calm bestie pep talk:
“c’mon, bros, we’ve handled gnarlier stuff—remember the cyclops fiasco?
we left that savage meltdown behind thanks to my big brain,
and if zeus is feeling lenient, we might do the same again.
so row with all you got, and you, helmsman, keep her away from the swirling doom.
don’t slip, or we’re done.”

i said nothing about scylla—didn’t want them to bounce in panic.
i forgot circe told me no armor, but i geared up anyway, grabbing two spears,
hoping i might catch that six-headed baddie lacking.
like, be fucking for real, i was pressing my luck, scanning the gloom for scylla. no sight—my eyes practically got bo3’d.

then we entered the narrow pass, tears in our eyes, scylla on one side, charybdis on the other,
slurping the sea like a savage.
when charybdis spat it back, it was like a huge cauldron frothing on the fire;
the foam soared high, the rocks hissed, undersea sands glimmered, the swirl so menacing we turned pale.
while we vibed on that, scylla snatched six of my best bros.
i glimpsed their arms and legs flailing above me, screaming my name in ultimate terror.
that was the biggest heartbreak i ever took in battle, no lie.
like a fisherman hooking fish with a long rod, flicking them out to flop around,
that was my friends, flailing in the air, devoured alive, hands outstretched.
that sight? beyond tragic.

we pulled away, surviving the double-l. soon we hit the sun god’s island, thrinacia,
where the flawless cattle chilled, plus the fat flocks.
even from the deck, i heard cows mooing, sheep bleating,
and i recalled how tireisias and circe both said “avoid that place, or f in the chat.”
so i told the crew: “be fucking for real, if we pass by, we good. if we land and do something shady,
the gods gon’ ratio us. let’s skip it.”

they basically said, “lol no.”
eurylochus popped off: “odysseus, you’re built like iron, man, you never let us rest.
you got zero chill. a savage storm might come at night—where we gonna hide if we keep sailing in the dark?
let’s dock, cook a meal, crash, and push off in the morning.”
everyone stanned him. i realized the gods were orchestrating our doom.
i made them swear the hardest oath not to kill or eat the holy cattle or sheep if we found them,
so we could munch only the goodies circe gave us.
they swore, we parked in a sweet cove, and got cooking.

for a hot minute, storms pinned us down. no other wind but that savage south or east.
as long as we had food and wine from circe, we left the cows unbothered.
but soon, we ran out, and hunger had us out here fishing birds or anything that moved, major scrounging vibes.
then i wandered off to pray for a miracle, but the gods put me in a savage nap.
while i dozed, eurylochus told the squad: “why die of famine? that’s big yikes.
let’s slaughter the best sun-cattle, then apologize with a fancy temple to helios if we ever reach home.
if he vibes and decides to kill us on the ocean, better quick death at sea than starving in some random island.”

everyone was like “based.” they took the top-tier cows, offered a janky sacrifice with no wine,
just water—desperate times. the hides started crawling, the meat mooed on the spit, ominous as fuck.
the goddess lampetie snitched to helios, and he told zeus, “punish these dudes, or i’m out.
i’ll light the underworld from now on—bye, not shining for mortals.”
zeus was like, “k, say less. i’ll nuke their ship.”

i woke up, smelled roast cow on the breeze, big facepalm.
i called out to the gods, “yo wtf, you let me snooze while they did the exact thing i told them not to?”
but it was done. the signs were cursed—bloodied hides slithering, the meat bellowing.
for six days, the bros feasted on them. on the seventh, the wind dropped, we launched the ship.

but once we left the island, zeus conjured a big dark cloud.
the west wind roared, snapping our mast, killing our helmsman, and launching me overboard.
zeus hurled lightning, obliterating the entire ship. my men got swallowed by the sea, no survival.
i barely clung to a bit of mast tied to the keel, swirling alone in the savage waves,
bouncing back into charybdis’s zone.

there, i latched onto a tall fig tree above the swirling mouth,
dangling like an awkward bat, zero place to set foot—
just waiting for my shattered boat pieces to reappear.
at twilight, the broken beams surfaced again,
and i dropped down, perched on them, paddling away like my life depended on it.
scylla didn’t see me this time (thanks, father zeus, guess?).
for nine days i drifted, big oof, until day ten, the gods had me wash up on ogygia,
where calypso, that boujee nymph, got me in her love-lair for ages.
but i told you that story yesterday, so i ain’t repeating that cringe, bestie.
