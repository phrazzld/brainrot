hermes the drip-lord (son of maia, big flex on mount kyllene)
swooped in clutch to herd the ghost-squad of all those suitors
who got popped at odysseus’s house—man had that golden wand on lock,
the same one he uses to put folks to sleep or wake them up, no cap.
he waves it once, and these specters go *ee-ee-ee* like bats
when they bail from a cave's gloom, clinging onto each other,
all squeaky and pressed together, yeeted along behind hermes.
dude leads 'em down the wide dusty road—ngl, it’s giving underworld vibes—
past the edge of ocean's flow, near the realm of dreams,
til they pop up in the asphodel meadows (iykyk),
where dead souls just vibe in their shadowy forms.

there, the squad runs into achilles’s ghost (that goat-tier hero),
plus his day-one bro patrokles, and fine af antilochos,
and tall ajax, who was big in both looks and vibes,
second only to the unstoppable achilles.
they're all standing around, busy with their dead-people small talk,
when the shade of agamemnon pulls up, still depressed asf,
followed by all the ladies who got murked alongside him
back in aigisthos’s messy house fiasco.

achilles is all like, “bro, we thought you were zeus’s fave,
ruling over that trojan war scenario, pulling rank on squads
and fighting with us at troy (which was big yikes).
didn’t expect you to catch an l like *this*, my guy—
should’ve gone out with a glorious bang, so the achaian homies
could build you a dope tomb and pass you epic clout,
but you got ended in the saddest, low-key way possible,
no funeral, no tears from your own crew. ouch.”

agamemnon’s ghost snaps back: “achilles, you absolute boss,
you died at troy with your name shining bright,
armies of trojans and achaian goats all around you,
we literally spent a full day duking it out for your body
til zeus threw a hamper on that fight.
we carried you home, bathed you in fancy oils,
everyone shaved their heads for you and bawled so loud
that your mom, the goddess thetis, rolled in from the sea,
and nine muses chanted a funeral jam so sad,
the entire achaian front was ugly-crying.

days on days we mourned, then burned your body
with a million offerings: sheep, cattle, all that.
your bones got placed in a golden jar (hephaistos’s work, flex),
mixed up with your boy patrokles, separated from antilochos,
because pat was your #1, i guess.
afterward, your entire crew raised a gnarly tomb on the beach,
so passersby can be like, ‘dang, that’s achilles’s spot,
the boi was built different.’
your mom even offered prizes to celebrate your epicness—
you are the blueprint, and your fame will never flop.

as for me? man, i got home only to get absolutely done dirty
by aigisthos and my cheating wife, clytemnestra.
that’s the tea.”

while they’re hashing out these gloom-lord vibes,
hermes slides in with the souls of the suitors,
and agamemnon spots amphimedon (they used to be moots).
agamemnon asks him how the suitors all ended up dead together,
like, “was it a shipwreck? a war? what the actual flop?”

amphimedon spills the tea: “listen, we were smooth-brain simping
for penelope, odysseus’s wifey, who finessed us with that weaving trick,
unweaving at night so we never got any closer to wedding bells.
three years that hustle worked, but we got wise in year four, big yikes.
then outta nowhere, odysseus popped back, disguised as a dusty hobo—
none of us recognized the man, we threw hands and insults,
he took it all in stride, then teamed with his son telemachos
to stash away the weapons and stage that suitor showdown.
when he bent that old bow and started sniping us,
we were done for. it was an ‘unalive speedrun’ fr fr,
blood all over the floor.
so yeah, that’s how we flopped, and our bodies are still lying
there, un-mourned, unwashed. savage.”

agamemnon’s ghost goes, “wow, odysseus snagged himself a real one.
penelope ain’t no clytemnestra—girl stayed loyal, secured his name in the pantheon of wifey legends.”

meanwhile, odysseus and telemachos bounce from the city,
head out to old laertes’s orchard crib.
laertes, that grandpa vibe with dusty clothes, is out there
hoeing the soil, looking all depressed.
odysseus fights back tears but decides to troll him a bit,
testing if dad will recognize him.
he calls him “hey old dude, orchard caretaker,”
then drops hints about “i once hosted a guy from ithaca,”
until laertes breaks down about his missing son odysseus.
finally, odysseus can’t hold back anymore:
he reveals the scar from that boar tusk,
reminds laertes of each orchard tree he was gifted as a kid,
and dad absolutely loses it, passes out from joy.
odysseus catches him mid-swoon, and they hug it out.

they go back to the house, where telemachos and the homies
are setting up a feast. laertes cleans up,
athena quickly does a glow-up spell on him (man’s face card is unstoppable),
and telemachos is like, “dang dad, grandpa’s looking like a living legend.”
laertes is feeling brand new, wishing he could’ve fought the suitors himself.

as they feast, rumor of the suitors’ demise spreads around the island.
eupithes (antinoos’s father) rallies a lynch mob,
crying about how odysseus left troy with his ships and men lost,
then came back and bodybagged the best of ithaca.
he whips up a chunk of the crowd, ignoring wise old halitherses,
who’s like “y’all asked for this, your kids were hella disrespectful.
better stand down or big trouble’s coming.”
but half the crowd storms off for revenge anyway.

athena checks in with zeus—should we push this war further or what?
zeus is like, “girl, just wrap it up. let them hold a peace treaty, no more blood.”
so athena zips down from olympus.

odysseus and his squad put on their armor,
ready to throw hands if the neighbors roll up.
laertes prays to athena, throws that spear,
and skewers eupithes on the spot, no cap.
odysseus and telemachos leap forward to finish them all,
but athena booms out: “stop, that’s enough. bffr.”
everyone freaks out and drops their weapons,
bolting back to town.
odysseus roars like an eagle about to chase them,
but zeus hurls a lightning bolt near athena,
and she says, “bro, chill or papa zeus will rage.”
so odysseus chills, big grin inside,
and athena locks in a peaceful vibe,
ends the beef, and seals it with an oath.

and that’s how the story closes:
peace in ithaca, no more suitor drama,
odysseus, laertes, telemachos, all gucci—
thank the gods and end scene.
