# T042 Part 1: Fix max-depth violations in search scripts

## Changes Made

1. Refactored `searchAllImages.ts` to reduce nested code:

   - Extracted image validation logic into a dedicated `checkImageExists()` function
   - Removed nested try/catch blocks from the main loop
   - Simplified the main loop to use the extracted function
   - Added proper TypeScript type definitions and return types

2. Fixed other issues along the way:
   - Updated module imports to use namespace imports (`import * as dotenv`)
   - Added proper error type handling in catch blocks
   - Improved error handling in the main script with detailed logging
   - Fixed formatting issues to pass ESLint

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: The code is now less deeply nested and easier to understand
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error types and proper logging
3. **Better Testability**: Extracted functions can be tested in isolation
4. **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types throughout the code

## Next Steps

To complete T042, we need to:

1. Refactor verification scripts to reduce nesting depth:
   - Apply extraction pattern similar to the one used here
   - Extract helper functions to flatten nested conditionals
   - Review and refactor loop structures

The approach taken for `searchAllImages.ts` can serve as a model for refactoring the verification scripts.
