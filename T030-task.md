# Task Analysis for T030

## Task ID: T030

## Title: Migrate full audiobook files to standardized locations

## Original Ticket Text:

```
- [ ] **T030: Migrate full audiobook files to standardized locations**
  - [ ] Identify missing full audiobook files (The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid)
  - [ ] Create/copy full audiobook files to: assets/audio/{book-slug}/full-audiobook.mp3
  - [ ] Verify only The Declaration has a full audiobook currently
  - [ ] Consider creating concatenated full audiobooks from chapters if originals don't exist
  - Dependencies: T021
```

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

Given the task T030 "Migrate full audiobook files to standardized locations", analyze the implementation approach considering:

1. **Context Analysis**:

   - We need to identify which books are missing full audiobook files
   - We need to verify which books already have full audiobooks
   - The Declaration reportedly has a full audiobook already
   - The Iliad, The Odyssey, and The Aeneid might be missing full audiobooks
   - We need to standardize the locations to: assets/audio/{book-slug}/full-audiobook.mp3

2. **Technical Considerations**:

   - Need to interface with Vercel Blob storage to check existing files
   - May need to concatenate chapter audio files if full versions don't exist
   - Must handle audio file concatenation properly (maintaining format, bitrate)
   - Should verify file integrity after migration
   - Must use the unified AssetService APIs

3. **Implementation Steps**:

   - Create script to audit existing full audiobook files
   - Develop logic to check for full audiobooks vs chapter files
   - Implement concatenation logic for missing full audiobooks
   - Create migration script to copy/move files to standardized locations
   - Add verification tests

4. **Testing Approach**:

   - Unit tests for concatenation logic
   - Integration tests for Blob storage operations
   - E2E tests for verifying audiobook accessibility
   - Mock external dependencies (Blob storage)

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Large file operations may timeout
   - Concatenation may produce files with quality issues
   - Storage limitations or quotas
   - Network reliability during migration

Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan addressing these considerations.
