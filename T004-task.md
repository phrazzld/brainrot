## Original Ticket Text

**T004: Create Unified Asset Migration Tool**

- Develop script to migrate assets from both DO Spaces and existing Blob paths
- Support dry-run mode for testing without actually moving files
- Implement concurrency control for faster migration
- Add comprehensive logging and error handling
- Dependencies: T001, T002

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

I need to analyze various approaches to implement a unified asset migration tool. The tool needs to transfer assets from both Digital Ocean Spaces and existing Vercel Blob storage to a new unified path structure that follows our asset service design.

Here's some context:

1. We currently have assets spread across Digital Ocean Spaces and Vercel Blob storage
2. We've defined a new unified path structure in T002: `assets/[type]/[book-slug]/[asset-name]`
3. We've implemented an AssetPathService that can convert legacy paths to the new structure
4. We need to handle different asset types: audio, text, images, shared, and site assets
5. We need to verify asset integrity after migration
6. We need a dry-run mode to test the migration without moving files
7. We need concurrency controls to improve performance

Please analyze different implementation approaches for this migration tool, considering:

- Architecture (single script vs. modular approach)
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- Verification mechanisms
- Performance considerations
- Logging approaches
- Dry-run implementation
- Batch processing vs. individual processing
- Pros and cons of each approach

Then recommend the most suitable approach for our needs and outline a high-level implementation plan.
