# T101 Plan: Inspect Vercel build logs for npm install error

## Task Description
Access the Vercel build logs URL from the error message and identify the root cause of the `npm install` failure.

## Background
Vercel deployments may be failing due to npm install errors. Understanding the exact cause of these failures is crucial for implementing the appropriate fix in subsequent tasks (T102, T103, etc.).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Locate Vercel Error Logs**
   - Check for deployment error notifications in email, Slack, or other communication channels
   - Find URLs to failed deployment logs
   - If no direct link is available, access the Vercel dashboard to view recent deployments

2. **Analyze the npm Install Errors**
   - Examine the build logs focusing on the npm install section
   - Look for specific error patterns such as:
     - Peer dependency conflicts
     - Node.js version incompatibilities
     - Package resolution failures
     - Memory issues during installation
     - Timeouts or network-related errors

3. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Determine the specific package(s) causing the installation failure
   - Check if the error is related to Node.js version incompatibility
   - Verify if the error is consistent across all deployments
   - Document the exact error messages and their context

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create a detailed report of the error analysis
   - Include relevant error snippets from the logs
   - Note the Vercel environment details (Node version, npm version)
   - Document any patterns or insights that will help in implementing a fix

## Expected Outcome
A clear understanding and documentation of:
- The exact error message causing npm install failures
- The root cause of the failure
- The Node.js and npm versions in the Vercel environment
- Any additional insights needed for implementing a fix in T102 and T103

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk as this is an investigative task
- May be challenging if logs are not easily accessible or have been pruned
- Might require Vercel dashboard access which should be verified
