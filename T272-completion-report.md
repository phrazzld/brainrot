# T272: Add Prettier npm script to package.json - Completion Report

## Task Description
Add npm scripts to package.json for running Prettier commands, including formatting check and automatic fixing.

## Completed Actions
- Examined the current package.json to understand existing scripts structure
- Added three new npm scripts:
  - `prettier:check`: Runs Prettier in check mode to identify formatting issues
  - `prettier:fix`: Runs Prettier in write mode to automatically fix formatting issues
  - `format`: Alias for `prettier:fix` for convenience
- Tested the scripts to verify they work as expected

## Results
Successfully added the following scripts to package.json:
```json
"prettier:check": "prettier --check .",
"prettier:fix": "prettier --write .",
"format": "npm run prettier:fix",
```

These scripts will make it easy to check and enforce code formatting across the codebase.

## Notes
- When testing the scripts, we observed numerous warnings about `importOrder` being an unknown option in the Prettier configuration
- We also discovered a syntax error in one of the test files (`__tests__/scripts/migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts`)
- These issues should be addressed in subsequent tasks, particularly in the task to "Configure Prettier/ESLint integration to avoid conflicts"

## Next Steps
1. Update the TODO.md file to mark T272 as complete
2. Proceed with the next task: "Configure Prettier/ESLint integration to avoid conflicts"
3. Consider adding a task to fix the syntax error in the test file
