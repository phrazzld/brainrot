## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

You are tasked with implementing comprehensive code formatting standards across a TypeScript/Next.js codebase. This task involves applying consistent formatting to multiple file types and potentially setting up automated checks.

Based on the project's DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md and DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md, analyze this task and provide:

1. **Scope Analysis**: What specific files and types need formatting updates?
2. **Tool Assessment**: What formatting tools are already in place and what needs to be added/configured?
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Step-by-step approach to apply formatting consistently
4. **Automation Plan**: How to ensure formatting standards are maintained going forward
5. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and how to mitigate issues?
6. **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the formatting changes work correctly
7. **Rollback Plan**: How to revert changes if something goes wrong

Consider the project's emphasis on:

- Prettier for code formatting (mandatory and non-negotiable)
- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD
- Pre-commit hooks
- Strict adherence to tooling without suppressions

Provide a detailed implementation plan that respects the project's philosophy of automation, consistency, and quality gates.
