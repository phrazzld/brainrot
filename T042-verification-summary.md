# T042 Part 2: Refactor Verification Scripts to Reduce Nesting Depth

## Changes Made

1. Refactored `verifyAudioMigration.ts`:

   - Extracted `constructBlobUrl()` function to handle URL creation
   - Created `updateCounters()` function to centralize counter logic
   - Simplified the main verification function by using these helpers
   - Added proper type checking for error handling

2. Refactored `verifyAudioMigrationWithContent.ts`:

   - Extracted `handleMissingAudioPath()` to handle missing paths without nested conditions
   - Created `processFileInfo()` function to centralize file validation and logging
   - Simplified the main verification function by removing nested conditionals
   - Improved error handling with proper type checking

3. Refactored `verifyBlobStorage.ts`:
   - Created `initializeBookResult()` to handle object initialization
   - Extracted `updateBookSummary()` to centralize summary updates
   - Added `verifyChapterAssets()` to handle chapter verification separately
   - Simplified the main verification function significantly

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Extracted helper functions reduce nesting depth
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Each function has a single responsibility
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added proper type checking for errors
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Clear function names describe their purpose
5. **Cleaner Code**: Simplified main functions by delegating to helpers

## Testing

- All refactored files pass TypeScript compilation
- All files pass ESLint checks with no errors or warnings
- The behavior of the code remains unchanged

This refactoring significantly improves code quality while maintaining the existing functionality, making the code easier to maintain and test in the future.
