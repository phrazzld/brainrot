# T023 Refactoring Summary: proxyService.ts

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the `proxyService.ts` file to improve its maintainability and reduce complexity. The file contained several complex functions with high cyclomatic complexity, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

## Key Improvements

1. **Parameter Objects**:

   - Replaced long parameter lists with configuration objects, making function calls more readable and maintainable
   - Created type definitions for all parameter objects, improving type safety and documentation

2. **Function Extraction**:

   - Broke down the large `proxyAssetDownload` function (~300 lines) into smaller, focused helper functions
   - Created specialized functions for specific tasks: URL retrieval, error handling, response creation, etc.
   - Each function now has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and test

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:

   - Standardized error handling across the codebase
   - Extracted common error handling patterns into dedicated functions
   - Improved error message clarity and context

4. **Type Safety Enhancements**:
   - Added comprehensive type definitions for all parameters and return values
   - Created discriminated union types for function results (e.g., success vs. error results)
   - Eliminated potential type-related bugs

## Refactored Functions

### Main Functions

- `proxyAssetDownload`: Converts a long parameter list to a configuration object and breaks down the implementation into smaller helper functions
- `proxyFileDownload`: Updated to use a configuration object for consistency (this was a deprecated function)

### New Helper Functions

- `logProxyRequest`: Handles logging proxy request details
- `getAssetUrlWithLogging`: Retrieves asset URLs with proper logging
- `handleAssetUrlError`: Specialized error handling for asset URL retrieval failures
- `fetchAssetWithLogging`: Performs the fetch operation with comprehensive logging
- `handleErrorResponse`: Processes error responses from fetch operations
- `createSuccessResponse`: Creates success responses with proper headers and logging
- `handleUnexpectedProxyError`: Handles unexpected errors in the proxy process

### Parameter Objects

- `ProxyAssetConfig`: Configuration for proxying asset downloads
- `ProxyFileConfig`: Configuration for legacy file downloads
- `ProxyErrorConfig`: Configuration for creating error responses
- `ErrorDetailsConfig`: Configuration for extracting error details
- `FetchAssetParams`: Parameters for fetching assets

## Tests

All tests have been updated to work with the refactored code and continue to pass, ensuring that the functionality remains unchanged despite the structural improvements.

## Impact

- **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now more modular and easier to maintain
- **Better Testability**: Each function has a clear purpose and can be tested in isolation
- **Enhanced Readability**: Code structure is more logical and easier to follow
- **Reduced Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity has been significantly reduced
- **Consistent Patterns**: The codebase now follows consistent patterns for parameter handling and error processing
