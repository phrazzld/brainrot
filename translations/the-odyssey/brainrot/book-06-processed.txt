yap at me muse, about how that legendary tough cookie oh-dee was catching z’s on the bank,
dead tired from battles with the brine and major exhaustion. meanwhile,
our girl athena is like, “i gotta get him some top-tier hospitality from the phaeacians.”

she *zoom* slides over to their city—once they lived near some savage cyclops baddies,
but their og king nausithous bounced them out to this fresh island, scheria,
built them walls, temples, farmland, then big rip. so now alkinoos runs the show,
blessed with god-tier cunning.

athena’s got a plan to set oh-dee up for that sweet homeward trajectory.
who’s her target? princess nausicaa, alkinoos’s daughter, beauty so lit she might as well be a minor goddess.
she sneaks into nausicaa’s bedchamber disguised as a friend and slides into her dream:

“girl, how you so chill when you got a wedding on the horizon? your fancy clothes are dusty as fuck.
you better wash those fits so you can stun your future hubby. your 'rents and all your bros will be proud.
so, at first light, hop a cart, gather the laundry, and get busy at the riverside. i’ll tag along.”

poof, athena bounces, dawn cracks open the sky, pink-finger mode.
nausicaa wakes up, surprises her folks: “dad, let me get a wagon and some mules.
gotta wash the fam’s drip. plus, you know i need to stay fresh for the big day.”
pops sees right through her—he knows she’s thirsty for that next-level wedding energy, but is like, “sure, baby.”

servants hitch the smooth wheels, the girl loads all those dirty robes, mom loads a hamper of snack and wine, plus a flask of oil for the post-wash glow-up.
she whips those mules, and off they roll, staff trailing behind.

they get to the scenic river: a dope place with big water flow, perfect for laundry day.
un-hitch them mules, let ‘em munch luscious grass, while they vigorously stomp out all the grime in big wash basins, showing off their #girlboss synergy.
once they spread the clothes to dry on the sunny shoreline, they feast on the snacks and then bust out some ball game vibes, tossing a ball, hair down, next-level carefree.
nausicaa’s basically glowing like goddess artemis gallivanting in the mountains with her nymph squad, unstoppable vibes.

then, as day wraps, athena’s like, “time to wake up oh-dee.”
she makes nausicaa whip that ball too far, plop into the river. everyone shrieks.
that shout jolts oh-dee from his sand-nap.

he’s all, “who even are these girls? mountain nymphs or actual humans?” but he’s got no time to think.
dude’s stark naked, covered in crusty salt. so he breaks a leafy branch to shield the goods, and approaches them like a lion in search of a meal.
the attendants scatter, #creepalert, but nausicaa, thanks to athena’s nerve-boost, stands her ground.

oh-dee’s debating: do i clutch her knees in supplication or keep distance?
he picks the respectful route: “princess, i don’t know if you’re mortal or goddess, but you look legit like artemis.
either way, i’m in deep doodoo: twenty days lost at sea, storms left and right. please help a ragged man.
i pray the gods bless you with a perfect marriage and that #couplegoals synergy.”

nausicaa’s like, “bro, you’re obviously no random scumbag. i sense the gods are behind your arrival.
we phaeacians are cozy with immortals. i’ll help with clothes, food, directions. come on.”

she tells her maids, “we can’t ghost a man in trouble. feed him, clothe him, let him wash up.
all travelers are from zeus. show him some love.”

they comply. oh-dee’s like, “thanks, i’ll wash myself over there behind that rock. y’all can stand aside.
i’m kinda shy about my sea-battered body.” #respect

they step away, he washes off the salt, rubs the oil, and athena sprinkles a glam effect: he emerges bigger, glossier, hair shining like hyacinth petals.
nausicaa sees him all glowed up, basically drooling, “dang, if only i could get a hubby just like him… #sigh.”

she sets up the wagon for the home trek: “okay, homie, hop in, but let’s roll with a plan. i don’t want randoms shipping us in a scandal.
phAIAcIAn TeA: folks might gossip if they see me strolling with a random hottie. so you follow behind, we’ll regroup when we near the city.

there’s a sweet grove of athena near the path—chill there a bit. i’ll go ahead, so the rumor mill doesn’t pop off.
then find your way to our palace, locate my mom queen arete at the hearth.
clutch her knees if you want a speedy visa home. if she vibes with you, so will dad, and boom, you’ll get a ship ride in no time.”

done, she whips the mules, they trot elegantly back through the farmland. oh-dee jogs behind with the maids.
sun sets, they reach the grove. oh-dee prays to athena one more time: “please, goddess, show me love. i got so many L’s, i need a W.”
athena hears but stays incognito, not wanting to anger poseidon, who’s still big salty.
