so the old nurse basically hopped up the stairs, low-key cackling,
fiending to break the big news to penelope: “girl, guess who’s back??
your boo odysseus is literally down in the living room right now,
came in late but just fully murked all those suitor clowns, no cap.”

penelope, all sussed out from so much heartbreak, was like, “be real, ma’am,
why you tryna psyche me up? i legit just crashed, and i was vibing in my sleep.
don’t come at me with weird delulu illusions; i can’t.”

the old nurse snapped back: “nah, bestie, i promise i’m not glitching.
that random beggar y’all dissed? that was odysseus incognito.
telemachus also knew the tea but kept it hush so he could avenge,
and now my man’s served up sweet payback—suitors are goners.”

that stung penelope’s heart with this wild surge of hope, so she jumped up,
gripped the old nurse, tears streaming: “sis, are you for real??
tell me how on earth a single dude dealt with that giant pack of savage simps.”

the nurse explained: “i, for one, didn’t see deets—
we were locked behind closed doors trembling,
till telemachus called me once big O had finished the job.
found him amid a bloody heap—like, so hardcore.
now he’s purifying the house with a big fire,
told me to fetch you. let’s go reunite, time for post-battle cuddles.
he’s *actually* here, living and breathing, your heartbreak is done.”

but penelope, queen of caution, was all, “chill. i’ve prayed for him every day,
but i gotta see receipts. maybe it’s a god punishing the suitors for their arrogance.
my odysseus was lost, i’m not letting myself get catfished.”

the nurse was like, “ugh, your trust issues, girl.
i recognized a scar on his leg back when i was washing his feet.
he swore me to silence, but i’m telling you now, it’s 100% him.
let me guide you, or if i’m capping, kill me. dead serious.”

penelope half-rolled her eyes but couldn’t help that flicker of hope.
“omg, okay, let me see for myself. i need to confirm.”

she walked downstairs, nerves all over the place. should she jump and hug him?
or test him? man’s was posted across from the fire, leaning on a column,
straight up waiting to see if wifey recognized him. penelope just sat there,
staring in silence, eyes scanning his face, then flicking away in doubt,
‘cuz he was still looking rough, rocking scruffy duds.

telemachus barked, “mom, you being savage. how can you ghost dad like that?
any woman else would be losing it in his arms after that insane saga. you cold.”

penelope was like, “child, hush. i’m stunned. if it’s truly him,
we have private signals only we share. i’m not about to throw myself at a random.”

odysseus chuckled, told telemachus, “let her test me. i came home looking dusty.
once i clean up, she’ll come around. but also, we gotta be strategic—
we took out the top dogs of ithaca, so drama is definitely about to brew.
we better keep the neighbors from suspecting a suitor massacre right away.
let’s stage a big party vibe so folks think it’s a wedding.”

everyone was like, “bet.” they cleaned themselves, changed clothes,
and the divinely skilled bard whipped out his lyre, starting up a hype jam.
the halls echoed with dance steps, so random passersby would assume,
“heh, penelope must’ve finally married one of ‘em suitors, rip odysseus…”

meanwhile, eurynome the housekeeper gave odysseus a fresh bath,
athena poured goddess-level glow-up magic over him,
making him taller, stronger, giving his hair that luscious hyacinth wave,
shining like hammered silver or gold. he legit looked like a god.
odysseus strolled back inside, sat across from penelope, and was like:
“woman, you must have a heart of iron. i’m back after 20 messed-up years,
and you’re just quiet. guess i’ll go sleep alone. s’cool, i guess.”

penelope answered, “don’t come at me, i’m not being rude.
i just had to be 100% sure because i’ve been catfished by illusions before.
but ok, eurycleia, set up the bed outside the chamber he built…”

odysseus nearly flipped out: “that bed is my masterpiece.
it’s literally carved around a living olive stump, impossible to move.
nobody can shift it except maybe a literal god.
if the stump’s gone, i know something’s up.”

penelope’s heart melted. that was the secret sign.
she sprinted over, threw her arms around his neck, sobbing:
“please don’t be mad. i was paranoid someone might trick me.
even helen messed up with that trojan drama. i needed proof.”

odysseus sobbed with joy, hugging his beloved wife.
they might’ve cried until dawn if athena hadn’t made the night last longer,
keeping sunrise on hold. at last they parted tears,
and penelope asked: “tell me everything. what next trial do the gods demand?”

odysseus said, “indeed, we’re not done. the ghost of tiresias warned me
i still need to carry an oar inland till i find folks who know nothing of the sea,
plant it there, sacrifice to poseidon, then come home again.
eventually i’ll die peacefully in old age, while my people flourish.
that’s the prophecy.”

penelope was like, “dang, if we get to live to see old age in peace,
that’s dope. i’ll take it.”

they kept talking, sharing all the epic struggles and heartbreak,
spilling tea on the suitor spree, the savage cyclops, circe, the underworld trip,
the sirens, scylla, charybdis, thrinacia’s cattle fiasco, calypso’s island,
the phaeacians’ kindness, until finally sleep overcame them both—
the first real rest in so many years.

athena, once she saw they’d enjoyed their conjugal vibe,
decided to lift her hold on dawn. morning was about to break.
odysseus got up, donned his gear, woke telemachus, eumaeus, and philoeitius:
“we gotta see my dad laertes in the orchard. also gotta keep it hush from the townsfolk.”
they marched out, still cloaked in night by athena’s grace,
off to tie up the last loose ends of this saga, leaving penelope in her room,
content that her long-lost man was truly home.
