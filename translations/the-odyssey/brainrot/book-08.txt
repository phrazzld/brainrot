yap, so next morn, rosy-finger dawn did her slay thing,
and big boss alcinous woke up hella early, hopped from bed,
and likewise odysseus, big city-demolisher, got up real quick.
alcinous led them all to the phaeacian hang spot near the ships,
where folks were pulling up to see wtf is going on with this rando.

athena, cunning icon, took the shape of a herald from alcinous’s posse,
whispering to each local: “oi, we got a big mood at the assembly.
there’s a new main character in town, a drifter? bet we go hear him.”
the hype spread, so the seats filled fast, big crowd vibing to see odysseus,
whom athena had just sprinkled with extra aura—taller, buffer,
so the phaeacians might respect him, no cringe.

once they sat, alcinous took the mic: “listen up, fam.
this stranger here, idk who, rolled into my house after epic ocean L’s.
he begs for a ride home, no cappin’. we got that 5-star boat service—
we never leave a homie stranded. so let’s pick our best 52 rower-chads,
launch a fresh black ship, rig her up with sails and benches real nice,
then bounce back for a party feast at my crib. i got y’all.

and yo, let’s bring the sacred bard demodocus, that goat-tier singer
zeus gifted with bars. time for a vibe check!”

the herald took off to fetch the divine bard.
the young studs went to the beach, slid the boat in the water,
stepped that mast, set those oars and rigged the sails.
they moored the ship in the harbor, then trooped to alcinous’s big house,
where the courtyard and hall was full of folks, old and young,
feasting. the king sacrificed twelve sheep, eight boars, two cattle—
the squad prepped a lavish spread.

the herald arrived with demodocus, who was blind but blessed with ultimate lyric drip.
they gave him a silver-studded seat, hung his sweet lyre overhead,
set a table with some bread and wine so he could jam fueled by good vibes.
everyone feasted and drank deep, then the muse spurred demodocus to sing some heat:
the epic about achilles and odysseus beefing at a feast of gods,
how their savage words made agamemnon’s heart grin,
’cause prophecy said top-tier achaean drama = major storyline.

odysseus, hearing these throwback war bars, hid his tears under a cloak,
’cause man was big triggered remembering that trojan arc.
whenever the bard paused, ody wiped them tears, took a sip, tried to play it cool.
but when the bard resumed, he copped the cloak again, sobbing on the sly.
nobody else clocked it, but the king alcinous, seated right there,
heard ody’s heavy sighs and was like “bro’s in meltdown mode.”

so the king stood up, addressed the phaeacian bigshots:
“we had a lit feast, but maybe let’s pivot, yeah? let’s do some sports to show the stranger our vibe.
’cause if he’s gotta flex to his hometown later about how we roll,
we might as well show him we’re cracked at track, wrestling, leaps, and sprints.”

everyone scurried out, the herald hung the bard’s lyre back on its peg,
leading demodocus aside while the crowd followed to watch the games.
there, top phaeacian athletes stepped up: akroneos, okyalos, elatreus,
nauteus, prymneus, anchialos, eretmeus, ponteus, proreus, thoön, anabesineos, amphialos,
plus eurylalus (built like ares fr) and laodamas, the king’s handsome boi.
the three sons of alcinous also: laodamas, halios, and godlike clytoneus.

first, the footrace: they drew a start line and whooshed across the dust—
clytoneus smashed the rest, leaving them in the dust, literally.
then the savage wrestling: eurylalus took that W.
amphialos soared with the long jump dub,
and elatreus slayed the discus, while laodamas was punch champion.

when they’d done all that, laodamas was like, “yo, let’s see if this stranger’s got game.
he’s tall asf, strong, maybe he can wow us.”
eurylalus piled on, basically insinuating ody might be just a merchant type, not a real athlete.

odysseus glared low-key savage: “bruh, that was out of pocket. i’m not just some moneybag boat captain.
i’ve been through war and waves, so miss me with that shade.
but okay, you want me to flex? bet, i’ll do it.”

he snatched a heavier discus than the ones they used, spun it, launched it so far the phaeacians ducked.
athena, disguised as some local, marked the spot: “dang, that’s beyond everyone else’s. nobody’s beating that.”
odysseus grinned, “who else wanna get this smoke? i’ll do wrestling, sprints, whatever,
except i won’t challenge the king’s own son to a fight—'cause i respect the host, no cap.”

everyone was quiet. then alcinous spoke: “relax, king of savage roasts, we see you.
nobody’s hating. you’re obviously an alpha in your prime.
but just so you know, we phaeacians aren’t all about the brawls:
we’re unstoppable rowers, got major foot speed, and we love good feasts, music, dancing,
fresh clothes, warm baths, comfy beds. that’s our brand.
speaking of dancing, let’s show him our ultimate moves.”

they called for demodocus’s lyre, smoothed the floor, opened the circle.
the herald returned with the sweet-sounding lyre, placed it in demodocus’s hands.
the young guys stood, prime in dancing skill, stepping so fast odysseus was shook.
the bard launched into that scandalous jam about ares and aphrodite hooking up in hephaestus’s bed,
how the sun snitched, and hep crafted cunning traps so the lovers were caught in an unbreakable net,
and the gods died laughing. hermes joked he’d do the same if it meant hooking up with the golden goddess.
poseidon had to negotiate their release, promising to cover ares’s bail.
anyway, aphrodite dipped back to cyprus, got pampered by the graces; ares fled to thrace.

the crowd roared at the gossip; odysseus found it low-key hilarious too.
then alcinous had his sons do a next-level ball dance routine—some insane tosses into the sky,
jumping to catch it like “no biggie.” ody was impressed, “king, you said your folks could dance, but that was next-level.”
alcinous beamed, like, “ha! thanks, big man. let’s gift you up. we got thirteen local kings: me plus twelve,
each will gift a cloak, a tunic, and a bar of gold. eurylalus better apologize with a sword, too—since he talked smack.”

everyone agreed, loaded ody with dope presents. eurylalus gave him a fully iced-out sword:
“sorry, my guy, didn’t mean to trash you. may the gods bring you home and bless your wifey and kin.”
odysseus accepted graciously: “thanks, bro. no hard feelings.”

then the heralds carried the shiny loot to queen arete, who stored it safe.
alcinous told the queen: “babe, let’s get a fancy chest, put a cloak and tunic inside for our guest,
heat some water for a nice bath, so he can soak, then see all these gifts stacked up.
i’ll give him a gold cup too, so he never forgets me when he’s sipping back home.”

arete had the maids stoke the fire, set a big tripod boiling.
she herself brought a polished chest with all the sweet gifts, and tossed in extra outfit.
“lock it up tight, ody,” she said, “so no shady boat bro swipes it while you nap.”
odysseus handled that lock expertly—circe had taught him the art of secure packing.

the maids called him to bathe. man, he was super stoked for a real bath,
hadn’t had one since he left calypso’s crib, no joke.
they rubbed him with oil, gave him a fresh cloak and tunic.
as he strolled out, nausicaa admired him from the porch,
saying, “bye, bestie—remember me if you ever reach your homeland. i basically saved your life.”
odysseus: “queen, you’re iconic. i’ll pray to you like a goddess if i make it home, i owe you big.”

he sat by alcinous again. dinner vibes fired up. demodocus rolled back in.
odysseus carved off a prime cut from a boar and gave it to the bard:
“take this, demodocus, ‘cause the muse obviously loves you, keep spitting those epic bars.”

after they ate, odysseus asked demodocus for that trojan horse saga:
“please sing about the trojan horse and how we took the city. if you nail it, i’ll know the gods truly favor you.”
the bard soared into the tale: achaean ships feigning departure, trojans hauling the wooden horse up their citadel,
the hidden achaean heroes springing out at midnight to wreck troy—big drama.
how odysseus and menelaus hit deiphobus’s palace in one last savage scuffle, aided by athena.

odysseus lost it, bawling uncontrollably, like a war widow clinging to her man’s body.
everyone else was enthralled by the story, but only alcinous spotted ody’s meltdown.
so the king was like, “pause the jam, demodocus. our guest’s in major heartbreak.
time to vibe-check him, figure out who he is. let’s not rub salt in his wounds.”

then he addressed ody: “bro, i see your tears. share your story. we gave you gifts, we plan your ride.
tell us your name, your city, your parents. no one’s blank-coded at birth.
my ships need to know your coordinates so they can speed you home.
our vessels pretty much drive themselves and never fail—though my pops once prophesied poseidon might get salty,
turn a returning ship to stone and bury our city under a big mountain.
hope that’s still pending. anyway, you’re clearly in your feels about troy.
did you lose a friend, a brother-in-law, or a bestie out there?
tell us your tale, so we can all share in your sorrow—and so bards may sing it forever.”
