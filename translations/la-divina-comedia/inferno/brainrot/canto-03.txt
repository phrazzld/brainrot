through me you pass to meltdown’s cursed domain
through me you slump in sorrow’s endless gloom
through me you find your squad undone in pain.

celestial justice built me in cosmic womb
the triple vibe—pure wisdom, prime love, big might—
spawned me; i stand forever, no resume to exhume.

before me, nothing else that wasn’t infinite took flight
so ditch all hope, you mortals stepping near
these words were etched in shadow, fueling my fright.

i asked, “bestie, these lines hit me weird, i fear”
he said, “it’s time to kill your cringe, stand tall, no lie;
we’re at the place i said you’d see weepy folks appear.”

he grabbed my hand, his aura calm but sly,
led me inside the zone of hush-hush gloom,
and i caught tears swirling starless in the sky.

chaotic tongues, savage shrieks, words that doom,
growls and squeaks that soared with claps of hands,
they churned through air like dust in a hot monsoon.

i froze, “yo mentor, who’s locked in these lands?
and why so big the meltdown and the cry?”
he said, “these are souls who rolled with bland demands,

no epic sin, no loyalty up high,
they repped themselves, ignoring any side;
heaven spurned them, and hell said ‘nah’—that’s why.”

i asked, “but what’s the l that torments them so wide?”
he sighed, “their puny fate: they envy death but can’t obtain,
no fame or pity, their legacy’s just denied.

look, watch that banner swirling in no refrain,
and see the horde behind it, stacked end to end,
lost were they all, by fear undone, their spirit in vain.”

i spotted that shade who dipped from honor, friend,
the dude who said big no when duty soared;
i knew these neutrals vex both god and fiend.

naked, they’re stung by wasps and gnats that roared,
blood and tears drip to feed gross worms below;
i turned, saw more souls crowd a large river’s board.

i said, “teacher, what’s up with that watery flow?
who are these wretches so pressed to cross at night?”
he: “we’ll see once we’re posted at acheron’s tow.”

then came a hoary boatman, hair bleached by ancient plight,
barking, “woe to you, vile souls, no heaven in your sights.
i’ll ferry you to darkness, no more day’s delight.”

he spotted me: “you living, bounce from these dead kites,
a different route, a gentler boat for you.”
my guide: “caron, hush; the one who reigns makes rights.”

the demon’s flame-lit eyes chilled, he said no more “shoo,”
but the weary naked crowd turned ashen pale,
cursing all: their births, their kin, their region, too.

they massed in tears by the vile bank, waiting to set sail,
caron herded them with his oar, lashing slackers out,
as leaves drop in autumn, so they plunge, frail.

one by one, each doomed child of adam in doubt,
heeds the sign like birds to a call, crossing that wave,
and fresh squads line up before the others are even out.

“kid,” my teacher said, “the souls who fed god’s wrath behave
like this, from every land, rushing to pass that tide;
heavenly justice spurs them, so fear flips to crave.

no righteous soul can ever hitch this ride,
so if caron’s pressed about you tagging along,
you know you’re not in his domain,” my guide replied.

just then the dark ground shook with quake so strong,
i broke into sweat, fear messing with my head,
a crimson flash overwhelmed my sense for long.

i collapsed, lights out, like one who dozes dead.
