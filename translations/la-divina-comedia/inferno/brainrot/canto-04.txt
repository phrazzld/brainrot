my big nap got clapped by thunder brutal-loud,
i jolted up, vibes scrambled in my head,
like someone forcibly yanked me from dream’s cloud.

my gaze whipped round, my body creaked like lead,
i stood up straight and scanned that shady zone,
“where am i even posted?” i lowkey said.

indeed i perched on the rim of sorrow’s throne,
the abysmal valley swallowing endless cries,
dark, deep, and hazy, swirling gloom full-blown.

i tried to stare through black but caught no prize,
not a single shape would load in my sight’s queue,
fog so dank it blocked my ocular tries.

“down we dip,” the poet said, pale as glue,
“i’ll lead up front; your spot is second wave,”
and yes, his face looked spooked, i’ll tell you true.

i quivered, “if you’re shook—my usual fave,
the cheerleader who kills my anxious meltdown—
then how’s this ride not pegged for a close shave?”

he said, “the squad down there is locked in frown,
their agony draws pity on my face,
you read it fear, but no, i’m not shut down.

the path is long, so let’s pick up the pace.”
with that, he slid me into circle one,
the outer ring that belts the chasm’s place.

there, i heard no shrieks—just sighs undone—
a trembling hush that rumbled the timeless air,
with babies, women, men by sadness spun.

they had no savage torment choking there,
just a deep longing that kept tears afloat,
countless souls stuck in moody limbo’s lair.

my teacher nudged, “aren’t you curious, goat,
who these big sad shadows might actually be?
listen, they never sinned but missed the boat—

no baptism pass to claim that skyward key,
or they existed pre-christ with no devotion;
that includes me, exiled from heaven’s spree.

for these defects alone, minus real commotion,
we’re doomed to thirst for paradise in vain,
living with zero hope, stuck in slow-motion.”

that stung my heart, for i recognized insane
heroic vibes among them, crowned with fame,
caught in this twilight, souls of might and brain.

“tell me,” i said, “did some gamer cheat this game,
or win release through their own OP skill,
and reach the blessed realm no more the same?”

he, reading my subtext, answered me still,
“i was new in this zone, still blinking slow,
when a victor came shining, crowned at will.

he scooped adam’s shade, abel’s halo glow,
noah, plus moses with the law-coded vibe,
abraham, david, and israel in tow,

with his father, kids, rachel (wifey tribe),
a bunch more legends, all whisked away to grace,
till then no soul had left these shadowed bribe.”

we pressed on, hearing his story at swift pace,
through ghost-thick forests stacked with cloudy heads,
he kept it moving, no time for deep embrace.

not far from wake, a glow cut night to shreds,
an orb that conquered half the gloom’s domain,
i guessed some litty folks in those homestead beds.

“teacher,” i said, “who flexes such big gain?
they’ve gotta be v.i.p. to rock that glow,
unlike the rest who mope in normal pain.”

he said, “their fame still thrives in upper show,
so heaven gave them bonus swank down here,
a star-tier courtesy few get to know.”

then a voice boomed: “give epic poet your cheer—
his shade returns, parted from us for a sec!”
i peeped four big silhouettes gliding near.

their vibe was neutral, no gloom or joys to wreck,
my guide exclaimed, “look: homer, alpha-bard;
he leads with sword, the other three in check.

beside him horace the satirist, savage-hard;
ovidio next, lucan last in line,
they hail me, we share that craft, no disregard.”

they made a beeline, greeting him so fine,
and that big brained master soared in the center,
their circle parted, hooking me in its design.

i joined that crew like i was top-tier mentor,
the sixth among that knowledge-power clique,
my teacher grinned, approving my new venture.

we strolled until a castle caught my peek,
seven tall walls, a moat that ringed around,
we crossed as if the water wasn’t bleak.

then through seven gates we strolled, on grassy ground,
where slow-eyed folks with regal auras trod,
they hardly spoke, but voices sweet did sound.

we took a corner, lit and bright, no facade,
surveying every shade in upper space,
my eyes got starry, legends left me awed.

there was electra, flanked by a fierce embrace,
with hector, aeneas, and big caesar’s stance,
hawk-eyed and ready for war’s savage race.

camilla, penthesilea rocked that lance,
latinus perched with lavinia by his side,
and brutus who canceled tarquin’s tyranny at a glance.

lucretia, julia, marcia, cornelia in pride,
i glimpsed saladin chilling off alone,
like he was on a different side yet didn’t hide.

i looked up higher, seeing the knowledge throne,
the boss of all who know, in wise array,
philosophers around him like kids unknown.

they all revered him, magnet for their sway,
i spotted socrates, plato, each right there,
democritus, diogenes, star thinkers on display.

anaxagoras, thales, empedocles bare,
zenon, heraclitus, orpheus re: sick tunes,
and diascorides, who dug plants with care,

linus, seneca, and cicero like boons,
euclid geometry boss, ptolemy star clan,
hippocrates, avicenna, galen—he balloons,

plus averroes with that commented plan.
i can’t name all—my story’s too huge to tell,
my narrative time is finite, mortal-span.

their squad parted, forming two lines as well,
my wise guru guided me from hush so mild,
past that chill zone toward a vibe that fell.

we ended up in dimness, no light compiled.
