arma and that dude, i’m singing, muse—like, you know that trojan main
who first got yeeted from his homeland straight to italy’s beaches,
fated fugitive vibes, all thanks to the savage rage
of queen juno, who legit never let that beef go.
my boy got thrown around so much on both land and sea
just trying to found a new city, bringing along his squad
and the trojan gods to latium. from that dna, for real,
came the latin tribe, old-school alban patriarchs,
and eventually the sky-high walls of rome. talk about a glow-up.

musa, i’m begging, drop the tea:
why did juno, queen of the gods, go that extra mile
to bully this legit pious hero with endless drama?
like, are divine minds that pressed, or what?

so check it: there was this ancient city, carthage, run by tyrian colonists,
posting up across from italy near the tiber’s mouth. they were big boujee,
stacked with gold and always ready to rumble. juno was ride-or-die
for carthage, even put it above her old fave, samos.
like, that was her power base, her special chariot zone,
and she super wanted this city to be top dog of the nations—
unless the fates said “nah.” but see, juno had heard some spoilers:
the trojan bloodline was set to raze her beloved towers one day,
leading a squad that’d rule the world, flexing all warlike,
and eventually wreck libya. so the fates had prophesied.
this was juno’s nightmare, so she never forgave trojans for that big war
when her argive besties had tried to crush troy.
plus, let’s not forget she still had savage flashbacks:
she was mad about the golden apple situation, that whole paris fiasco,
and that trojan upstart hooking up with the gods (looking at you, ganymede).
so yeah, fueled by all that cosmic salt, she kept the trojan leftovers
wandering the seas, far from latium. fates forced them to circle
every ocean for years, no cap. big bet: that’s what it cost
to plant the seed for rome’s epic future.

happened like this: the trojans were vibing, finally leaving sicily
and setting sail, super hype, their prows slicing sea-foam,
when juno sees them from her cosmic penthouse.
still nursing that eternal wound in her chest, she’s all:
“for real? i gotta watch these trojan scrubs make it to italy unscathed?
am i that powerless? or do the fates block me?
look at pallas: homegirl literally incinerated an entire greek fleet
’cause one dude, ajax, dissed her. she hammered them with lightning,
split their ships, and pinned him on a rock with a vortex. savage.
but me? i’m queen of the gods, jove’s sis *and* wife,
and i’ve been waging a million-year war on these trojans.
where’s my cred? no one’s bringing offerings to my altars anymore.”

while big mad juno’s stewing, she bounces to aeolia,
the storm-kissed homeland of the winds, under king aeolus.
he’s got them locked up in a massive cave, or they'd rampage the sky,
the seas, even hades. the whole vibe. jupiter locked them up
and made aeolus the caretaker with a tight contract:
“release them or clamp them down, but on my signal, bestie.”
juno dips in: “aeolus, my guy, father jove gave you the keys
to the winds. i need you to wreck the trojan fleet cruising the tyrrhenian sea—
they’re super sus. sink their boats or scatter them, idgaf which.
i’ll sweeten the deal: i’ve got a stable of next-level nymphs,
and i’ll give you the hottest one, deiopea, to be your wifey for real.
just do me this solid, okay?”

aeolus is like, “say less, queen. you run the show.
you got me this throne and front-row seats at the gods’ banquet.
winds, mount up.” he stabs the cave wall with his spear,
boom—winds burst out like an unstoppable train.
northerlies, easterlies, and that savage african gust come raging,
rocking the ocean’s core, rolling titanic waves to shore.
trojans freak out, sails screaming, thunder overhead,
daytime snatched away by swirling black skies.
aeneas himself feels big time shook, limbs going numb.
he prays: “omg, i wish i’d died back at troy,
like big hector or that unit sarpedon, instead of drowning here.
big yikes.”

next, a savage gust tears their sails, waves tower to the heavens,
the oars snap, the prow swings around, a watery mountain
crashes onto them, so some ships ride the wave crests,
others drop into watery pits exposing the seabed. total chaos.
notus slams three ships onto hidden rocks, the so-called altars.
eurus shoves others into the shallows, beaching them in quicksand.
one wave smacks orontes’s ship so hard it flips,
and the captain flies off into the surge.
armored dudes are flailing, trojan treasure floats away.
neptunus notices the ocean going nuts, and he’s pissed.
he calls out the winds: “so you punks messing with my domain?
who said you could whip up storms without my sign-off?
go scurry home, or i’ll set you straight.
aeolus can keep his drama in his own cave.”

fast as a tweet, the sea calms. clouds vanish, sun returns,
nymph cymothoe and triton help pry the ships from reefs,
while neptunus glides the waves in his flashy ride.
it’s like an angry mob in a city raging, throwing stones,
till a real based elder shows up, hushes them, and they’re like, “bet.”
the meltdown chills. that’s neptunus, boss-mode.

so the trojans, beat down, head for the nearest coastline in libya
and find a quiet cove. there’s an island forming a natural harbor,
tall cliffs on either side, a grove overhead.
they dock seven ships, drag themselves to shore,
soaking and depressed. they spark a fire with flint,
pull out some soggy grain, and try to roast it.
aeneas climbs a rock to scout if any fellow trojans are around,
spots some deer instead. whips out achates’s bow,
drops the biggest stags, then picks off the rest,
felling seven giant deer to match his busted fleet.
he hands out wine from acestes in sicily,
like, “hey besties, i know we’ve been through it,
but we survived scylla’s jaws and cyclops’s stones.
keep your heads up, these rough days will pass.
trust, we’ll hit latium soon, our new trojan home.”
he’s fronting confident for his squad, but inside he’s hurting bad.

while they feast, they lowkey worry who got lost at sea:
orontes? amycos? gyas, cloanthus? big question marks.

meanwhile, up in olympus, jove’s surveying the world,
and venus is like, “dad, what the actual?
you promised trojan blood would rebuild bigger and better,
but these trojans keep taking L’s. is that the vibe?”
jove smiles: “relax, cyntherea. i said your crew’s fated for greatness.
aeneas will fight big wars in italy, sure, but he’ll build a city.
ascanius (now called iulus) will rule for thirty orbits,
move the capital to alba longa. from that line emerges
romulus, wearing a wolfskin drip, founding rome,
which i swear will be unstoppable. eventually,
even savage juno will chill and champion the roman empire.
a trojan named caesar (descended from iulus) will star in the galaxy,
dominate land, sea, and whatever. war will fade, furies locked up,
and the world will vibe in peace. pinky promise.”

so jove sends mercury to calm things in carthage, so queen dido
doesn’t slam the door on the trojans. mercury flutters down,
and the carthaginians suddenly get all friendly.

aeneas, though, can’t sleep, so at first light he heads to scout,
stash the ships in a forest cove with achates as his plus-one.
venus meets them, disguised as a huntress: short skirt, hair in the wind,
like she’s got that spartan girlboss aura. she’s like,
“hey have you seen my sis? carrying a quiver, rocking lynx fur?”
aeneas goes, “nope, but who you, goddess?
cuz you sure don’t sound mortal.”
she’s all, “nah, i’m just a local princess. you’re in punic territory,
ruled by queen dido, who fled her psycho bro in tyre.
long story—he iced her hubby sychaeus for gold,
his ghost told her to run, so she bounced with a crew,
landed here, and built this fresh city. but you, who are you?”

he answers, “we’re trojans, homie. i’m aeneas.
we got smacked by storms, lost some ships.
just let me find my people.”
venus: “chill, i bet your crew’s fine. see those swans up there?
that’s a sign. your boys are safe at the harbor.
go talk to queen dido, she’s not as savage as you think.”
then she glows and dips. aeneas is like, “mom, come on,
why you catfishing me?” he can’t even hug her.
she cloaks them in a divine cloak so they can slip into carthage stealth mode.

they roll up to dido’s city, marveling at the hustle:
some folks build walls, some dig the harbor, some raise theaters,
like busy bees in summer—milk and honey vibes.
aeneas sighs, “dang, these people are thriving. if only my trojans—”
they pass a big temple to juno, and aeneas sees murals of the trojan war,
he’s like, “yo, even in foreign lands, we got clout. i’m lowkey comforted,
seeing my squad’s story. someone out there cares.”
he sees fierce scenes: achilles chasing trojans, troilus falling,
hector’s corpse ransomed, memnon and penthesilea leading amazons, the works.

then queen dido appears, looking like diana among her nymph entourage,
and all the carthaginians gather around. she’s dishing out tasks fairly,
giving them ratio and vibes. suddenly aeneas notices his missing homies
rolling in, begging for help. ilioneus steps up:
“please, we’re trojans. we got wrecked at sea, we’re not here to pillage.
just let us fix our ships or we’ll bounce to sicily, or hopefully to italy.”
dido is like, “relax, we’re not that savage. i’m sorry if i freaked you out.
this is a new city, gotta keep it safe. but i know troy’s rep.
you can stay here or go wherever. oh, if only your leader aeneas
were here.”

then poof, the cloud cloak fades, and aeneas stands shining like a demigod.
he thanks her: “queen dido, you saved us from a tragic end.
we owe you big. the gods will reward your kindness.
your name’s gonna live rent-free in our hearts forever.”
dido’s starstruck: “are you that aeneas, son of anchises and venus?
i even remember trojans passing through sidon. this is fate.
come on in, we share the same vibe—i’ve had my share of tough roads, too,
so i know how to help.”

she leads them to her palace, orders a feast, sends gifts to the trojan shore.
aeneas sends for his boy ascanius and for gifts to repay dido—
helen’s fancy robe, an embroidered cloak, a regal scepter, gold jewelry,
to woo the queen big time. but venus, spooked by juno’s meddling,
instructs cupid to disguise as ascanius, so the real kid’s stashed away safe,
while cupid goes in, making dido catch feels heavy.

by the time dinner hits, the hall’s lit: gold cups, lavish plates,
torches shining off the ceilings, the vibe's *bussin’*.
dido lifts a huge cup to jupiter: “yo, king of gods, bless this union
between trojans and tyrians.” the guests cheer, pass the wine.
iopas the bard jams on a gilded lyre, singing about the moon’s phases,
the sun’s changes, the seasons, all that cosmic stuff. folks are enthralled.

dido can’t take her eyes off aeneas/cupid. she’s peppering him with questions
about troy, about hector, about diomedes and achilles.
finally she’s like, “tell me everything from the jump—
the trojan horse, the battles, your epic wanderings.
spare no tea, bestie. we got all night.”
