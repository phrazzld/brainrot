once they pulled up by xanthus, that big swirling flex fathered by ZEUS,
my guy swift-footed achilles started parting trojan squads like they were random threads on a glitchy feed,
some got chased straight onto the fields near the city (where they’d majorly freaked out yesterday under unstoppable hector’s warpath),
and hera threw a thick fog in front of ’em so they’d slip away no cap.
the rest panicked so hard they dove into xanthus’s silver swirl with a massive splash,
the riverbanks howled from the wave-echo, horses and trojans flipping out in the current,
like locusts bailing on a sudden wildfire—when the heat just says “try me” and they dip to water—
so these trojans flung themselves into xanthus’s swirling depths to dodge achilles’s heat.

but big achilles, practically vibing like a minor god, left his spear chilling in the tamarisk on the bank,
he stormed in brandishing only a sword, that unstoppable thirst in his soul,
slicing trojan necks left and right, painting the water red with that lethal artistry.
like a massive dolphin among smaller fish, he reigned over that current,
scattering trojans under the sheer dread that he might snap them up whole.
till finally, exhausted from all that kill streak, he snagged a dozen trojan youths alive
to sacrifice for pat’s (that’s patrOCLoS) funeral, savage vow.
he had them trembling like baby deer, bound them up, and gave them to the boys to haul off to the ships,
then turned back for more carnage, no mercy in his eyes.

there he crossed paths with lycaon, one of old king priam’s brood,
the same kid achilles once seized at night in papa priam’s orchard, hacking shoots for his chariot rails.
achilles sold that dude off to lemnos, but lycaon rolled back home, and now just eleven dawns in troy later,
fate tosses him again into achilles’s kill zone—like, talk about unlucky algorithm.
the swift-footed one spotted him, bare of helmet, shield, spear, all left behind in the frantic river flight,
and he’s like “bruh, do trojans i slaughter just get respawns now? is that real? i see you made it from lemnos, skipping the ocean’s stop sign. let’s see if you can dodge my spear.”

lycaon freaked out, grabbed at achilles’s knees, hoping to weep away his doom,
crying, “i’m not *that* hector, i didn’t off your bestie pat, so have a crumb of pity, boss.
i’ve eaten your bread before as prisoner—why kill me thrice for the same ticket?
probably i pissed off ZEUS or something, cause i keep dropping back into your kill streak.
but let me breathe, i beg.”

achilles smirked savage, said, “man, you shoulda known. ever since pat ate dust, i’m on a no-mercy run.
you think i’m letting you trojans slip? not a chance. pat was better than all y’all, and he’s gone.
i’m pretty asf, and i’m legit demigod spawn, yet i too gotta meet the same grave appointment eventually,
so save those tears; no one outruns fate if i catch you in this zone.”
he jabbed his blade down, slicing lycaon’s throat in a single merciless motion,
then booted him into the current like trash, calling to the swirling river,
“here, xanthus, enjoy a snack. your fish bros can lap up that blood with zero cares.
no trojan mama’s gonna wrap him in fresh linens—i’m shipping him direct to the open sea.”

that set the river god flaming with wrath. swirling up unstoppable waves, he rumbled,
scheming to stop achilles from making troy an extinction event.
but the unstoppable one leaped at asteropaios, a son of that broad-flowing axius,
the river-born warrior all fired up by xanthus’s raging spirit, cause achilles was turning trojans into fish fodder.
they squared up, each launched spears: asteropaios scratched achilles’s right arm but failed to land a kill blow,
the golden gifts of the gods blocked the rest.
achilles’s spear soared wide, so he drew his sword and lunged—asteropaios tried to yank out that unstoppable ash spear from the bank,
three times he tugged, three times the wood refused, then achilles jumped him, sliced him open at the gut,
spilling his innards on the muddy shore and jeering:
“flex all you want about your watery lineage—my lineage from ZEUS outranks your big river dad.
oceans, rivers—they all fear the father’s thunder. so hold this L.”
he stomped away, still roiling, piling up paeonian bodies by the wave.

finally xanthus hollered from his swirling depths, “yo achilles, you’re going insane on my turf.
if father CRONOS let you wreck the trojans, at least move that gorefest to the plain.
my flow’s clogged with bodies, i can’t do my watery job. just chill or i’m about to douse you.”
achilles shot back, “okay but not yet, i gotta see hector’s face meet my blade. after that, do you.”

this triggered xanthus to call out to simois, “bro, let’s flood this savage beyond measure.
dump everything, tear up trees, crank the wave high, smother him so deep in silt that not even the achaean homies find his bones.”
the raging river swelled, hammered achilles with top-tier watery combos,
but swift as a hawk, he hopped from eddy to bank, yet the current kept cornering him.
in despair, he cried to father ZEUS, “bruh, you said i’d fall to apollo’s arrows, but the real op is this drowning? not the vibe.”
POSEIDON and ATHENA rolled up incognito, gripped his hands, whispered, “quit whining, the gods got you. just keep smashing trojans, then claim hector. you’ll be fine. for real.”
achilles took heart, forging ahead, but the river kept raging bigger—until HERA freaked he’d drown,
so she told HEPHAESTUS, “light it up, my guy. burn these trojans and scorch the river’s banks.”
he unleashed monstrous flames, scorching trojan corpses, drying the fields, boiling fish in the swirl.
xanthus howled, “enough! i yield! i can’t handle the blacksmith god’s molten vibe. i’ll never help trojans again, i swear.”
hera told hephaestus to chill, so he snuffed the blaze. the river receded, exhausted.

meanwhile, the gods themselves went ham on each other, the cosmic group chat blowing up with roasts and skirmishes.
ARES charged ATHENA, brandishing a spear, cursing her for messing with him back when diomedes stabbed him.
she cracked him with a massive boundary-stone, toppling him seven acres in a clang of dusty armor,
smirking, “you still think you match my vibe? take this L for ditching the achaeans.”
aphrodite tried to drag ares off the battlefield, but HERA tipped off ATHENA, who slapped them both so hard aphrodite dropped her gear. they fled, tears in their eyes.

APOLLO side-eyed all this, refusing to scrap with poseidon.
but artemis roasted him, calling him a coward.
then the almighty queen HERA turned on artemis, hammered her with her own bow, knocked out her quiver,
and the virgin huntress fled in tears, leaving her mother leto to pick up her scattered arrows.
like, the entire pantheon was throwing hands or dipping, chaotic as a glitchy server.

at last, the gods parted back up to olympus, some heated, some smug.
down below, achilles kept stomping trojans like a living inferno.
priam watched from the towering walls, mourning how unstoppable that demigod was,
pleading the gatekeepers to open wide so the panicked trojans could rush inside.
’cause achilles looked ready to annihilate them all.
and so they poured in, not pausing to see who survived or who died,
desperate to hide behind troy’s walls, while achilles was lured away by APOLLO’s ruse,
chasing a false shape, missing the fact that trojans were slipping back to the city in droves.

that’s how the swirl of battle raged at xanthus’s banks in those savage hours.
