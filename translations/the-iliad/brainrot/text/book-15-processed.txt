once the danaans hustled back past the spiked trench,
with many already bodied under trojan fists,
the survivors sat trembling by their chariots, pale and speechless;
meanwhile on ida’s heights, loud-thundering zeus stirred,
lifting himself from beside golden-throned hera,
casting his gaze on the trojans blazing with hype,
the argives battered, rolling backward,
and in their midst the earth-shaker, rocking out of line.

he also saw godlike hektor lying in dust,
his homeboys huddled ‘round him, down bad,
the warrior spitting up crimson for real,
hit by some savage achaean shot.
cloud-gatherer zeus felt pity in his father-soul,
but lasered a fearsome glare at queenly hera:
“girl, i see your cunning—making shining hektor
fold mid-battle and scattering his squad.
don’t test me: you recall that day i strung you overhead,
golden cords around your wrists, anvils from your feet?
no rescue for you then, no pity from gods,
not after how you conjured storms to jack herakles.
don’t make me spin that track again.”

cow-eyed hera shook under his scowl,
hands up, swearing on mother earth, wide heaven, and dread styx:
“don’t drag me, i’m not controlling the earth-shaker.
he saw the argives sink and took pity,
it’s on him alone. i’d calm him if you say so.”
zeus grinned in that “maybe i won’t smite you” way:
“fine, white-armed bestie, do what i say:
go gather swift iris and far-shooter apollo.
iris shall warn poseidon to back off,
or taste my raw thunder.
apollo will hotwire hektor’s courage,
wipe that pain so he can push the argives back.
then they’ll beg swift-footed achilles.
his ride-or-die, patroklos, will jump in and get slain by hektor,
only for achilles to murk hektor in savage payback.
this is the day i promised silver-foot thetis. no changes now.”

hera, hearing that, soared away from ida like a mind on fast-forward,
landing among the deathless on high olympus.
she speedily flagged down iris, messenger goddess,
and apollo the golden archer, summoning them to zeus.
iris shot off in a swirl of color; apollo likewise soared.

earth-shaker poseidon still raged among the breakers,
but swift iris found him and spilled the father’s threat:
“hey, sea-lord, step off or big zeus will clap you.
he claims he outranks you in power. watch yourself.”
poseidon bristled—an og brother of zeus,
yet grudgingly he said, “whatever, i’ll yield for now.
but i swear, if they don’t wreck ilion eventually, i’ll be fuming.”
with that, he vanished into the brine, the achaeans mourning his exit.

then the son of kronos turned to radiant apollo:
“far-shooter, hurry to bright-helmed hektor—
poseidon dipped, so no cosmic brawl.
take the tassled aegis in hand,
flash it to rattle the argives.
our shining boy hektor needs fresh might
to shove them back to their black-beaked ships.
once they’re pinned, i’ll set the stage for new drama,
and eventually let them breathe so fate can keep spinning.”

like a hawk on a power dive, apollo soared to hektor,
who had just rolled up from near-death gloom,
still coughing, his bros around him.
the archer-god glided close and spoke in a hush:
“hektor, pride of priam, why the slump?
snap out of it. father zeus sends me,
phoibos apollo, to guard and stoke you.
rally your trojans, charge the hollow ships,
for i’ll smooth the path and scatter the argives.”

fresh vigor lit hektor’s eyes, and he jumped
like a proud stallion freed from the stable,
hooves drumming loud as it charges the open field,
mane streaming in the breeze, heart wild with confidence.
so hektor sprang to his men, barking commands;
the trojans roared, driving at the danaan trench,
where apollo, clutching zeus’s fearsome aegis,
toppled the argive ramparts with ridiculous ease—
like a child smashing a sand tower by the shore.
gray dust plumed up, chaos enveloped the greeks,
and old nestor threw his arms up to the starry sky,
shouting, “zeus, remember the bulls we sacrificed at argos?
if we ever pleased you, don’t let us be snuffed out now.”
zeus rumbled his thunder, fueling trojan hearts with bloodlust.

they stormed forward as a wave pummels a deep-sea vessel,
the wind wailing, the hull shuddering under watery fists;
so trojan spears hammered the greeks, pressing them back.
hektor, shining in his war-helm, lunged for the black ships’ prows.
great aias rallied his men, brandishing a hefty pike:
“my dudes, we have no walled city behind us,
no fallback plan. either we stand or we’re done.
think of your families back home, your pride, your fate.
if you let them burn the ships, we’re literally stranded.”
he thrust and roared, but shining hektor roared louder,
blessed by zeus, eyes flashing with lethal fire.

like a ferocious lion bounding on grazing cattle,
spreading panic with bloody jaws,
so hektor raged among the achaeans.
the deck planks ran slick with lifeblood.
teukros tried loosing arrows, but father zeus snapped his bowstring.
the big archer cursed as the weapon fell from his hands,
and telamonian aias barked, “spear up, brother—
we fight at close quarters now.”
still trojans poured in, unstoppable.
their war-cries soared to the sky.

nestor, the old g, shouted once more,
“remember your parents, your kiddos, your wives—
all that stands on this fight. dig deep!”
bright-eyed athena parted the battle-smoke from their eyes,
giving the achaeans a final edge of clarity.
but the trojans pressed on, unstoppable as a monsoon.

amid that swirling doom, zeus’s plan advanced:
the ships teetered on the brink of flames,
the achaeans shook in fear they’d lose all,
while destiny’s path shaped unstoppable drama:
hektor’s star would blaze, then fade,
swift-footed achilles would fill with unstoppable rage,
and the trojan fall would loom.

so ended this savage day’s clash,
the trojans unstoppable at the prows,
the greeks pinned, trembling between trench and hull,
yet still, the gods’ tapestry unrolled,
threads of wrath, honor, heartbreak, and fate,
woven under loud-thundering zeus’s watchful eye.
