yooo muse, tune me in on the final stretch of this beef,
how each trojan homie dipped back to their swift ships at dusk,
all craving some munch and a nap, while *swift-footed achilles*
laid awake in the dark, big sad. the man was straight-up haunted
by memories of patroclus, his bro lost too soon,
so no sweet sleep could numb his brain—he just kept rolling around,
side to side, face up, face down, in the makeshift gloom,
craving his pal’s old vibes and unstoppable energy.
tears on tears, sometimes he’d bolt from the bed and pace the surf,
dawn never soothing that raw meltdown.

when the first glimmer of *rosy-fingered day* crept in,
achilles harnessed those *godlike, rapid horses*,
tied hector’s corpse at the chariot’s tail, then lashed it thrice
‘round patroclus’s burial mound—for real, savage disrespect.
he’d slump back to his hut, leaving the dust-covered body in the open,
but *apollo*, that *baddie with the silver bow*, felt pity.
he wrapped the corpse in a glowing aegis, kept the flesh fresh,
‘cause even though hector was toast, that vibe deserved some respect.

up on olympus, the gods side-eyed achilles’s savage drag,
some wanting *hermes, the top-tier messenger*,
to swerve in quietly and steal hector away.
but *white-armed hera* and her clique—*poseidon*, *grey-eyed athena*—were big mad:
“screw troy, screw priam, screw paris’s cringe golden-apple business.”
still, *phoebus apollo* popped off on the twelfth dawn:
“y’all acting cold! hector gave you prime sacrifices,
yet you let his body get dissed like this?
achilles is built like a lion, but with zero empathy;
he’s gotta chill, or we, the immortals, gotta intervene.”

*snow-armed hera* snapped, “are you for real, apollo?
you’re telling me *hector* (mortal, random mom)
should stand on par with *achilles* (son of silver-footed thetis, basically a demigod)?
nah, can’t do that.” but *cloud-lord zeus* overruled them all:
“basta. i love hector too—he gave me plenty offerings—
but i can’t let you snatch him in secret.
thetis hovers near her son 24/7.
summon her, i’ll lay down orders:
he better let hector go in exchange for major loot.
then i’ll send *iris* to priam, so that father can roll up
and buy back his boy with top-tier gifts.”

so *wind-swift iris* soared off, diving into black seas,
found thetis sobbing in her salted cave with her sea-squad.
iris: “hey queen, big daddy zeus wants a chat.”
thetis moaned but obeyed: she snagged her darkest cloak,
whooshed up the waves, reached olympus’s shining peak,
slid in, took a seat by father zeus. all the gods lounged around,
and *hera of the golden chalice* offered thetis a comforting sip.
zeus said, “lady, i feel your heartbreak, but i gotta do this.
your boy’s hoarding hector’s corpse, pissing off the pantheon.
tell him release the body with grace and accept the ransom.”

like lightning, thetis left to find *swift achilles*,
who brooded in his tent, his men busying themselves with a meal.
the goddess sat beside him, murmured gentle words:
“child, how long will you fast from food and from a woman’s warmth?
patroclus is gone, but you’re still breathing.
zeus is raging at you for keeping hector’s body caged.
release him, take the gifts—no sense in doubling the gods’ fury.”

achilles sighed: “yeah, ok, if father zeus commands, i’m down.
let ‘em bring the gold.”

meanwhile, *zeus the counselor* shot *iris* off again,
straight to priam’s palace, where the old king lay in dust,
weeping, surrounded by wailing sons.
iris whispered: “priam, father of troy, enough despair.
zeus wants you to take a wagon of lavish treasure,
go pay off achilles for hector’s body.
roll out with a single herald. no trojan army.
fear not: *hermes* will guide you safe. just do it.”

priam sprang up, ordered a fancy cart readied:
twelve robes, shining cloaks, hammered gold, epic tripods,
a gorgeous thracian bowl—dude wasn’t playing.
he snapped at the trojan crowd, parted them from his yard,
scolded his sons: “y’all worthless lumps next to hector, troilus,
the real ones. they’re all gone, and i’m stuck with you. move. harness the mules.”

the wagon loaded, he prayed to *wide-browed zeus* for a sign.
bam—an eagle soared overhead, confirming the journey.
priam rolled out, trembling but determined,
while *cloud-lord zeus* summoned *argus-killer hermes*:
“go, guide the old man to the achaean ships unnoticed.”
hermes slipped on his golden sneaks, took his wand that lulls or wakes men,
zipped down, shape-shifted into a young lord, approached priam by the river.
“hey, old king, what’s with the secret nighttime loot run?
ain’t you worried about savage greeks? let me help.
i hail from the myrmidons, i know achilles.”
priam’s heart softened, sees the divine favor in him.
hermes hopped on the cart, flicked the reins,
put all watchers to sleep, flung open the gates to the greek fortress,
zoomed inside.

once they neared achilles’s shelter, hermes said,
“i’m out before he spots me—I’m a god, it’s awkward.
you go kneel, speak of fatherly sorrow, and beg.”
priam stepped in, sees achilles finishing dinner with automedon and alkimus.
the old king grabbed the killer’s knees, kissed those monstrous hands,
everyone froze in shock. priam pleaded,
“think of your dad, oh achilles, i beg you.
my city’s ravaged, i lost all my sons. hector was the last,
my city’s shield—now you’ve ended him. i brought gifts, please let me bury him.”

achilles felt a surge of tears for his own father, for patroclus.
both men wept, echoing sorrow, heartbreak bridging mortal and demigod.
finally, achilles stood, raised priam gently:
“this grief is endless, old man. but the gods weave sorrow into mortal life,
we can’t skip it. i’ll yield. i’ll release your boy for ransom.
don’t push me further though.”

like a lion striding from his den, he called for maids:
“wash hector’s body, anoint him in secret, so priam doesn’t flip out.”
they cleansed and wrapped hector’s form in bright cloth,
achilles lifted it personally onto the polished cart,
then prayed to *dead patroclus*: “don’t rage, bestie, that i freed hector—
he brought a sick ransom, and i’ll share it with you.”
with that done, achilles invited priam to eat,
“even *niobe*—who lost twelve kids to apollo and artemis—
ended up chewing food eventually. your sorrow is huge, but you gotta eat.”
so they sat, exchanged stares. priam marveling at achilles’s godlike frame,
achilles moved by priam’s regal heartbreak.

once fed, priam asked for a bed,
“since i’ve not shut my eyes since the day you killed my son.”
achilles arranged a place outside, not wanting any greek official to spot him.
but before that, he asked priam, “how many days to handle the funeral?
i’ll hold the war for that long.”
priam: “nine days to mourn, a tenth to burn, an eleventh to raise the tomb,
then the twelfth we fight if we must.”
achilles nodded: “cool. i’ll keep the armies off your back.”

they slept, though *hermes* soon awakened priam:
“dip out now, old man, before agamemnon or the greeks notice.”
priam and his herald stole away at dawn,
carrying hector through the hush, guided by the gods.

when they arrived at troy, *cassandra*, fair as gold aphrodite,
spotted them from the high rampart, shrieked:
“come see, trojans, see father with hector in the wagon.”
the city poured out, wife and mother reached the cart first,
hugging hector’s head, wailing in unstoppable waves.
they placed him on a carved bed, kicked off the official laments.
*andromache*, holding his head, wept that their baby is doomed,
their city is doomed, and no warrior stands to protect them.
*hecuba* wailed how even in death, the gods kept him looking fresh.
*helen* sobbed about how hector was the only trojan who didn’t treat her like scum,
despite all her guilt for the war. the entire city roared with grief.

priam gave the word to gather wood under achilles’s truce.
for nine days they lugged logs from the mountains. on the tenth,
they lifted *horse-taming hector’s* body high on the pyre and lit the flame.
the next dawn, they doused the embers with red wine,
collected the pure bones in a golden casket, wrapped in soft cloth,
laid them in the hollow earth, heaped a mound of stones,
posted watchers, and then returned to priam’s halls for a sorrowful feast.

thus ended the funeral of *hector, breaker of horses.
