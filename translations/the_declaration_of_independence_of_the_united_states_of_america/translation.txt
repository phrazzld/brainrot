facsimiles of thomas jefferson's draft

the declaration of independence of the united states of america  
yo, so listen up fam, when the whole human saga gets hella extra and it’s time for a squad to yeet outta those toxic political chains that had us all caught up with some other lame crew, we gotta scoop up that independent, equal flex among all the cosmic power-ups on this wild globe cuz nature and that supreme nature god be handing out the ultimate clout rights – so respectfully, we gotta spill the crazy tea on why we off that old system, no cap, for real mmkay!!!

we stan these lit facts: our squad be born equal from day one, blessed by the cosmic creator with non-negotiable rights like living large, staying free, and chasing that pure happiness vibe; and to keep that drip secure, governments are built on our collective upvote energy so if any government starts acting sus and ruins our vibe, our squad got every right to yeet it away and build a fresh, fire system that keeps us safe and hyped, deadass!!!

yo, real talk, common sense be like “nah fam, don’t flip an ancient government over some transient, lame drama” cuz history shows that peeps usually stick with some cringe if the evil is lowkey bearable instead of smashing the status quo – caught in 4k and all that jazz!

but then, when a never-ending train of cap moves and abuse streaks shows that the only goal is to force us into total despot mode, then it’s our sovereign duty to cancel that shady gov and set up new guardians to keep our future on lock – big yikes for monarchy vibes, for real!!!

seriously, these colonies have been chillin' under mad abuse for too long and now the only move is to hit the reset button on the old system, no cap – we’re forced to level up, my dudes!!!

and yo, our current king of great britain got a track record so savage its a reel of repeated injuries and power grabs solely aimed at bossing us with absolute tyranny over our lands – so imma drop the receipts: facts on deck for all to see, no filter, pure savage stunts!!!

he straight up ghosted his assent to laws that were hella wholesome and necessary for the public glow-up – like, bro, where’s the respect for the vibes?

he capped his governors from droppin’ any fresh, urgent laws unless they waited on his bogus approval, and then when they were on pause, he left ‘em on read like total cringe, smh!!!

bro, he wouldn’t even vibe with passing laws for boosting large peeps’ comfort unless they traded in their mad rep rights in the legislature – that right is priceless to the squad and only a mega flex against tyrants!

he summoned the legislative crew in super awkward, off-the-map spots far from their record stash, just to tire ‘em out so they’d cave into his shady measures – straight up power-glitch, no cap!!!

he kept yeeting the reps’ houses on repeat whenever they bravely clapped back against his invasive, manly attacks on our rights – brutal and savage AF, fr fr!!!

after yeeting entire assemblies, he ghosted from calling fresh elections so that the legislative power, which can’t be totally erased, just sat there exposed while the state got wrecked by outside invasions and inner chaos – mega glitch, bro!!!

he tried blockin’ the squad’s growth in these states by straight up obstructing naturalization laws for foreigners, refusing new ones to hype migration here, and jacking up the conditions for new land grabs – major gatekeeping, big yikes!!!

not even justice got a proper flex cuz he clowned on laws meant to set up a legit judiciary squad, totally obstructing the just vibes – omg so extra!

he turned judges into his personal puppets, bossing their tenures and paycheck drip solely on his own will – pure abuse of power, deadass savage!!!

he stacked up a whole army of new offices and then spammed a swarm of officers to badger our peeps and literally snack on our resources – total clown fest energy, no cap!!!

even in chill, peaceful times, he rolled in with standing armies without so much as a nod from our legislatures – like, bro, touch grass and ask us first!!!

he flexed so hard to make the military its own boss, even above civil power – mad sus buff upgrade, extra cringe!!!

and on top of that, he linked up with other power trappers to force us into a legal zone that ain’t even in our constitution, giving his nod to bogus, pretend legislations – straight up jurisdiction betrayal, no cap!!!

for shoving massive squads of armed peeps into our crib:  
for shielding them with a mock trial so they wouldn’t catch heat for murdering our peeps:  
for jacking up and cutting off our global trade hooks, totally blocking our money moves:  
for slapping taxes on our squad without even a hint of consent, straight up tax impostering:  
for robbin’ us of those trial by jury perks in mad numerous cases, sus af:  
for yeeting us across the ocean to get grilled for fake, made-up offenses – total cringe trip:  
for ghosting the free english law vibes in a nearby province, dropping an arbitrary government, and blowing up its borders to serve as a cringey blueprint to bring that same absolute rule into our colonies, mega oof:  
for swooping away our cherished charters, scrapping our supreme laws, and totally reconfiguring the very structure of our governments – cap move central:  
for putting our own legislatures on an unwanted timeout and then declaring themselves the bosses who can drop laws on us in every wild scenario, straight-up abuse of power, yikes!!!

he dipped on proper government right here by booting us out of his protective circle and then straight launching a war against us – so toxic and extra it hurts!!!

bro, he raided our seas, wrecked our coasts, torched our towns, and straight up demolished our peeps’ lives – a total gank fest with no chill!!!

yo, right now he’s shipping in massive squads of foreign mercenaries to complete his death, desolation, and tyranny project, dropping cruelty and backstab vibes that are off the charts, like barbaric times multiplied and totally unworthy of any civilized head – mega glitch energy!!!

he forced our fellow citizens, captured on the high seas, to grab arms against their own squad – either turning them into executioners for their own homies or having them get yeeted by their own hands, pure betrayal drama, fr fr!!!

and he stirred up local insurrections big time while also hyping the frontier peeps – those merciless, savage indian warriors whose battle mode just wrecks every age, gender, and status alike, a raw, undistinguished rampage that’s extra cringey and savage in the worst way!!!

throughout all these oppressive, sus moves, we kept sliding in humble petitions for a fix – but all we got back were more savage diss receipts, so like, a dude marked by every act of tyrant-level cringe is totally unfit to rule a free squad, period!!!

and yo, we didn’t ghost our british brethren – we kept warning them from time to time about their own legislature’s shady attempts to extend unwarranted jurisdiction over our squad, reminding them of our epic migration and settlement backstory, appealing to their native justice and chill generosity, and even summoning all our common fam vibes to call out these blatant usurpations that would totally wreck our connections – but they stayed dead silent, like, total mute on the real tea. so now, forced by necessity, we accept that splitting up is the only move and we peep them as enemies in war even if in peace they’re still kinda our friends – messy af, no cap.

so listen up, we the representatives of the united states of america in general congress, vibing hard and appealing to the supreme judge of the cosmos for the pure rectitude of our intentions, hereby drop this epic manifesto in the name and by the authority of the good peeps of these colonies, solemnly publishing and declaring that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states – totally uncuffed from any allegiance to the british crown, and every political link between us and great britain is canceled and dissolved, deadass; and as free and independent squads, we got full power to launch wars, lock down peace, forge alliances, set up commerce, and do every righteous thing that independent states are born to do, no cap; and for the support of this declaration, riding hard on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor – all in for that ultimate freedom drip!

december, 1972 [etext #2] – retro drip era, caught in the time warp, lol

****the project gutenberg etext of the u. s. bill of rights****  
the united states bill of rights. – straight-up legal flex, iconic drip, 100% no cap

the ten original amendments to the constitution of the united states passed by congress september 25, 1789 ratified december 15, 1791 – historic sauce, epic vibes from way back, legit legendary

i  
yo congress ain't gonna play puppet by setting up a state religion squad or harshing our free spiritual flex, and they sure ain't gonna snatch our free speech or press drip – plus our right to chill, gather up peaceably, and slide into the government with our beef and grievance tea is untouchable, deadass.

ii  
since a hella tight, well-regulated militia is the key for a free state's safety, our right to snag, hold, and flex arms is unbreakable – no one can mess with our armory drip, straight facts.

iii  
no soldier, even in chill peace mode, gets to crash in someone’s crib without that owner’s legit approval, and even in war they gotta follow the law’s bomb-ass guidelines – no shady squatting allowed, fr fr.

iv  
our squad’s right to keep ourselves, our cribs, our docs, and our swag safe from random, sus searches is unassailable – no warrant drops unless there’s solid probable cause backed by a legit oath that spells out the exact spot and what’s getting hit up, all according to the rules, no cap.

v  
yo, no one gets locked down or held accountable for a major or infamous crime without a proper grand jury laying out the tea, except for those in active land, sea, or militia duty during war or danger; and you ain’t gonna get double jeopardized for the same cap move, nor forced to snitch on yourself, nor have your life, freedom, or cash snatched without a fair process, and your private drip won’t be taken for public use without just coins – pure legal drip, period.

vi  
in any criminal drama, the accused gets that speedy, public trial flex with an unbiased jury from the exact district where the cap went down – all set by law – and they gotta be fully clued in on the shady deets, face off with the witnesses, even force a backup squad of witnesses if needed, and score legal counsel to defend their honor – true justice vibes, no cap.

vii  
in civil beefs where the money at stake is over twenty bucks, the right to a jury trial stays 100 intact, and no fact dropped by a jury gets rehashed in any u.s. court except strictly by the old-school common law rulebook – keeping it classic and on point.

viii  
no one is forced to drop excessive bail cash, nor get slammed with sky-high fines, or endure any cruel, unusual, or hella extra punishments – that’s a straight up hard pass, fr fr.

ix  
just cuz some rights are listed in the constitution doesn’t mean the other rights the squad keeps on lock get dissed or denied – all our rights remain 100 in full force, no cap.

x  
any power that the constitution doesn’t hand over to the united states or specifically block from the states is totally reserved for the states or the people – extra local authority flex, deadass!
