# Plan for "Create a function to generate public URL for Blob assets"

## Current Implementation Analysis
We already have a few functions to generate Blob URLs:
1. `getBlobUrl(legacyPath)` - Converts a legacy asset path to a Blob URL using the BlobPathService and BlobService
2. `getAssetUrl(legacyPath, useBlobStorage)` - Determines whether to use Blob storage or fallback to local path
3. `assetExistsInBlobStorage(legacyPath)` - Checks if an asset exists in Blob storage
4. `BlobService.getUrlForPath(path)` - Generates a URL for a blob path

However, there are several areas for improvement:
- No URL caching for improved performance
- No clear utility for generating direct URLs with custom blob paths
- No distinction between development/production environments
- No consolidated function that handles all blob URL generation scenarios

## Implementation Approach
1. Create a new `generateBlobUrl` function with enhanced capabilities:
   - Accepts multiple URL generation formats (blob path or legacy path)
   - Has environment awareness (development vs production)
   - Works directly with existing blob service
   - Has clear typing and documentation

2. Add this to the `utils/getBlobUrl.ts` file alongside the existing functions

3. Enhance the BlobService.getUrlForPath method to support different environments and handle edge cases better

4. Update the README or documentation explaining the URL generation functions

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the BlobService.getUrlForPath method to handle different environments
2. Create the new generateBlobUrl function in getBlobUrl.ts
3. Add proper TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
