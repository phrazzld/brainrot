# Task T201: Verify Blob Storage Configuration

## Task Description
Verify Blob storage configuration by running `npx tsx scripts/test-blob-storage.ts` to confirm the Blob token and URL configuration are working properly.

## Implementation Plan
1. Ensure environment variables are properly set in .env.local:
   - BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL

2. Execute the test script we've already created:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-blob-storage.ts
   ```

3. Verify that the script:
   - Successfully connects to Vercel Blob storage
   - Uploads a test file
   - Downloads the file and verifies content
   - Lists files in the test directory
   - Reports success

## Success Criteria
- Script executes without errors
- Test file is successfully uploaded and accessible via the correct URL
- Content verification passes
- Blob listing shows the test file(s)
