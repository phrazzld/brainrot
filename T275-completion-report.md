# T275: Configure Jest for TypeScript and Next.js - Completion Report

## Task Description
Configure Jest to properly work with TypeScript and Next.js, ensuring that tests for React components function correctly with the project's ESM modules and React 19.

## Current State Analysis
- The project already had Jest and React Testing Library installed
- Jest was not properly configured to handle ESM modules and React 19 compatibility
- Component tests were failing with "Unexpected token '<'" errors indicating JSX transformation issues
- React components could not be rendered in tests

## Implementation Details

### 1. Jest Configuration Updates
- Created an updated `jest.config.cjs` file with proper TypeScript and React 19 support
- Configured transformers for different file types:
  - Custom babel transformer for React component files (.tsx)
  - ts-jest for TypeScript files (.ts)
  - babel-jest for JavaScript files (.js, .jsx)
- Added module mappers for CSS, images, and other assets
- Configured JSDOM test environment with appropriate options

### 2. Babel Configuration
- Created `babel.config.cjs` for proper JSX transformation
- Configured babel presets for React 19 and TypeScript

### 3. JSDOM Setup
- Updated the Jest setup file to properly set up the JSDOM environment
- Added mocks for browser APIs and environment variables

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Created mock files for images and CSS imports
- Added a simple test component to verify configuration
- Updated test scripts in package.json to use the new configuration

## Test Results
- Basic utility tests are working correctly
- Simple React component tests are working
- More complex component tests may need updates or mocks

## Next Steps
1. Complex component tests (like DownloadButton.test.tsx) will need updates to work with the new configuration
2. Test environment in these components has recursive mocks that need to be restructured
3. The next task should focus on setting up npm scripts for running tests in different modes

## Fixes for Specific Issues
- **JSX Transformation**: Fixed by using a custom babel transformer for TSX files
- **ESM Module Support**: Configured Jest to properly handle ESM modules
- **Test Environment**: Set up JSDOM with appropriate options
- **Module Mocking**: Added proper mocks for CSS, images, and other assets
