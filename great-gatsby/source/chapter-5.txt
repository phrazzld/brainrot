When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula
was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made
thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I
saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.

At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved
itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the
house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in
the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again
as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away
I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.

“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.

“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing
into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”

“It’s too late.”

“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool? I haven’t made use
of it all summer.”

“I’ve got to go to bed.”

“All right.”

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call
up Daisy and ask her to come over to tea.”

“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to
any trouble.”

“What day would suit you?”

“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put
you to any trouble, you see.”

“How about the day after tomorrow?”

He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance:

“I want to get the grass cut,” he said.

We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn
ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that
he meant my grass.

“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.

“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.

“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of gestures.
“I thought—that is—” He swallowed. “I thought you might be offended.
You see, she’s a little shy, and the first time she saw you she was just
going to leave when you came in. But she’s got an idea in her head, and
she wants to see you about it. She wants you to ask Gatsby to your house
some afternoon and then let her come over.”

“You mean you want me to invite her to tea?”

“Yes.”

“And you want to be here when she comes?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I’ll call her up.”

“I want to get the grass cut,” he said again.

“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.

“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.

“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of gestures.
“I thought—that is—” He swallowed. “I thought you might be offended.

“Well, I’ll call her up.”

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

“You mean you want me to invite her to tea?”

“Yes.”

“And you want to be here when she comes?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I’ll call her up.”

The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of
the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the
hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at
noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the
woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist,
and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly
into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.

“Hot!” she said, and when I picked it up for her she remarked “Thanks,”
and turned her glistening eyes on me.

There was a rush of people from the rear of the train, and we were swept
out into the long, white tunnels of the lower level.

I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come
to tea.

“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.

“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.

The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a
raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that
Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I
had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg
Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some
cups and lemons and flowers.

The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived
from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later
the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit,
silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there
were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.

“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.

“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”

“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked
out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe
he saw a thing.

“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they
thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal. Have
you got everything you need in the kitchen?”

I haven’t made use of it all summer.”

“I’ve got to go to bed.”

“All right.”

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call
up Daisy and ask her to come over to tea.”

“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to
any trouble.”

“You mean you want me to invite her to tea?”

“Yes.”

“And you want to be here when she comes?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I’ll call her up.”

He went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of
pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe he really heard the phone ring.
He was standing in the middle of the room, with his hands in his pockets,
and his head tilted back.

“I’m going to call up Daisy and ask her to come over to tea.”

“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to
any trouble.”

“What day would suit you?”

“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put
you to any trouble, you see.”

“You mean you want me to invite her to tea?”

“Yes.”

“And you want to be here when she comes?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I’ll call her up.”

The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which
Gatsby’s lawn glittered like a Christmas tree. I lit the fire and sat
down to wait. It was a quarter to four.

When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again
in the unquiet darkness.

Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects
had diminished by one.

I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in
the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume
attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.

“Who’s this?”

“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”

The name sounded faintly familiar.

“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”

There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the
bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when
he was about eighteen.

“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had
a pompadour—or a yacht.”

“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about
you.”

They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies
when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.

“Yes.… Well, I can’t talk now.… I can’t talk now, old sport.… I said a
small town.… He must know what a small town is.… Well, he’s no use to us
if Detroit is his idea of a small town.…”

He rang off.

“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.

The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and
there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just
get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.��

I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence
made them feel more satisfactorily alone.

“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the
piano.”

He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes
accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed
glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a sport
shirt, open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.

“Did we interrupt your exercises?” inquired Daisy politely.

“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.
“That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up.”

“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you,
Ewing, old sport?”

“I don’t play well. I don’t—I hardly play at all. I’m all out of practice.”

“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey
windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He
lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a
couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming
floor bounced in from the hall.

When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench
and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.

“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all
out of—”

“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”

In the morning,
In the evening,
Ain’t we got fun—

Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along
the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric
trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.
It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating
on the air.

One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer
The rich get richer and the poor get—children.
In the meantime,
In between time—

As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment
had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred
to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years!
There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short
of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal
vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He
had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the
time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No
amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his
ghostly heart.

As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took
hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward
her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its
fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that
voice was a deathless song.

They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby
didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back
at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room
and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.
