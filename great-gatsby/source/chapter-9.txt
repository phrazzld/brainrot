After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the
next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper
men. In the morning, in the evening, and at night, the house was always
full of people, and I was always answering questions and giving advice.
There was a constant stream of people moving through the house, from the
front door to the back, and out again.

I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he
lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry.
Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”

Meyer Wolfsheim’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me his
office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I
had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.

“Will you ring again?”

“I’ve rung them three times.”

“It’s very important.”

“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”

I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were
speaking of her.

“But she didn’t come to the funeral,” said the man.

“Why, no,” said the other man. “She didn’t even send a flower. Nothing.”

“The day of the funeral so many people came to the house that it was
like one of his parties.”

As a matter of fact, it wasn’t one of his parties. It was a very small
funeral.

“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.

“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”

“I’d like to come.”

“Well, come then.”

The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his
eyes filled with tears.

“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.

“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”

“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I
keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine
died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s
sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”

I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so
I stood up.

“Are you a college man?” he inquired.

“Yes.”

“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not
after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything
alone.”

When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg
in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr.
Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and
in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something
to show me.

“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling fingers.
“Look there.”

It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with
many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look there!” and
then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think
it was more real to him now than the house itself.

“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”

“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”

“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now.
Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there
was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever
since he made a success he was very generous with me.”

He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,
staring at it with faded eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from
his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy.

“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”

He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the
last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12,
1906. And underneath:

    Rise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.00   A.M.
    Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . 6.15-6.30   ”
    Study electricity, etc. . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   ”
    Work  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30   P.M.
    Baseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.30-5.00   ”
    Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00 ”
    Study needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . . 7.00-9.00   ”

“I come across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It just shows
you, don’t it?”

“It just shows you.”

“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or
other. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always
great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”

He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking
up at me expectantly.

“I think he’d of helped build up the country.”

“That’s true.”

I said that I had to get a wreath and that I’d be back in a few minutes.

When I returned the drawing-room was empty.

“The minister’s waiting,” said the butler.

“Let’s go.”

We went out to the door. It had stopped raining, and the sun was shining.
About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and
stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly
black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and
a little later a car with four or five servants and the postman from West
Egg. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.

“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.

“Neither could anybody else.”

“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”

He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.

“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.

One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and
later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago
would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December
evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own
holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats
of the girls returning from Miss This-or-that’s and the chatter of frozen
breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances,
and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? The
Herseys’? The Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in
our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee
& St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks
beside the gate.

When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began
to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights
of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly
into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner
through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this
country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it
again.

That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns,
but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and
sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown
by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with
the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in
the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through
decades by a family’s name.

I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby,
Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some
deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.

Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of
its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio,
with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and
the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West
Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as
a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and
grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless
moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along
the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white
evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with
jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one
knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.

After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond
my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was
in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided
to come back home.

There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing
that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things
in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my
refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened
to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly
still, listening, in a big chair.

She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a
good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the colour
of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove
on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was
engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she
could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised.
For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought
it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.

“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw
me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a
new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”

We shook hands.

“Oh, and do you remember—” she added, “—a conversation we had once about
driving a car?”

“Why—not exactly.”

“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?
Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me
to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward
person. I thought it was your secret pride.”

“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call
it honor.”

She didn���t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously
sorry, I turned away.

One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead
of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out of
his pockets, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to
his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he suddenly
saw me and waited.

“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly.

“I’m going to my office,” I said.

“Come in and have a drink,” he said.

“No, thanks.”

“Come on, I’ll buy you a drink.”

“I’m in a hurry.”

“Well, I’m in a hurry, too,” he said. “What’s the matter? If we’re friends,
let’s be friends.”

We shook hands and I started away. Just as I was out of hearing he called
“Hey, Nick!” and I turned around.

“What’s the matter?”

“I hear you’re going away.”

“Yes.”

“Well, so long.”

We shook hands again, and he went on.

I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was,
to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They
were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures
and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or
whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up
the mess they had made.…

I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as
though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to
buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my
provincial squeamishness forever.

Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown
as long as mine. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its
lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was
some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t
know that the party was over.

On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I
went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.
On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of
brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my
shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and
sprawled out on the sand.

Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any
lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.
And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away
until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once
for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished
trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered
in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory
enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this
continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood
nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s
wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s
dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have
seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know
that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under
the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year
recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we
will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.… And one fine morning—

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
the past.
