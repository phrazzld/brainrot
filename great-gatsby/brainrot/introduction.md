## DEDICATION SECTION (because we respect the original energy)

**once again to zelda**  
_the ultimate level 10 gyat who inspired this whole literary grindset_  
_the original it-girl who understood that love and chaos go hand in hand_  
_without whom this story of obsessive devotion would hit completely different_

## THE EPIGRAPH (but make it maximum brainrot)

_"then wear the golden gyat hat, if that will move her sigma aura;_  
_if you can mewing-bounce high, bounce for her ohio rizz too,_  
_till she cry 'lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing gigachad,_  
_i absolutely must have your unmatched chaotic energy!'_  
_- thomas 'brainrot prophet' parke d'invilliers"_

this poem is basically the entire plot summarized: do whatever cringe thing necessary to get the girl's attention, even if it means becoming someone you're not. gatsby took this advice and ran with it straight into the most expensive identity crisis in american literature. we love a king who commits to the bit even when the bit destroys him.

**WARNING**: you are about to experience the great gatsby like never before. prepare for your brain to be simultaneously educated and absolutely rotted. this translation maintains 100% plot fidelity while achieving maximum chaos density. every character voice has been carefully brainrotted while preserving their essential literary function. nick's commentary style will make you question reality, gatsby's mysterious energy will hit different, daisy's valley girl maximalism will be iconic, and tom's toxic alpha behavior will make you want to ratio him into oblivion.

buckle up besties, we're about to deconstruct the american dream using nothing but internet slang and pure literary respect. this is where high culture meets terminally online energy and somehow creates something beautiful.

_let the brainrot begin..._
