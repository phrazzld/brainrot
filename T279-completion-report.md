# T279: Fix Jest Configuration for React 19 Components - Completion Report

## Task Description
Update the Jest configuration to properly handle React 19 component tests, focusing on fixing the failing DownloadButton.test.tsx tests.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Analysis of the Issues
- Identified that React 19 component tests were failing with "Target container is not a DOM element" errors
- Found that certain tests were unable to properly render components or access DOM elements
- Discovered issues with ESM modules and import.meta

### 2. Custom Test Utilities
- Created a dedicated `test-utils.tsx` file with a custom render function that works with React 19
- Implemented proper DOM element handling in the custom render function
- Added support for the `act` function to properly wrap state updates

### 3. Jest Configuration Updates
- Updated `jest.config.cjs` to properly handle ESM modules
- Modified the transformer configuration in `jest-babel-transformer.cjs`
- Updated the Jest setup file to provide a proper DOM environment

### 4. Test Component Updates
- Modified the DownloadButton tests to use more robust selectors
- Updated the SimpleComponent test to demonstrate and verify the testing setup
- Added container-based queries that work reliably with React 19

### 5. DOM Environment Setup
- Added JSDOM configuration to properly set up the DOM environment
- Created a consistent approach to handling DOM elements in tests
- Configured the DOM environment to be available for all tests

## Test Results
- All DownloadButton tests are now passing
- The SimpleComponent tests are passing
- The test configuration now properly supports React 19 components

## Future Work
- Some other tests like reading-room-blob.test.tsx still have issues that need to be addressed
- The ESM module handling for scripts like cleanupLocalAssets.test.ts needs additional work
- The TypeScript errors in migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts need to be fixed

## Conclusion
This task focused on fixing the critical Jest configuration issues for React 19 component tests, specifically the DownloadButton tests. We've successfully implemented a solution that makes these tests pass, and created a solid foundation for addressing the remaining test issues in future tasks.
