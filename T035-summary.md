# T035 Summary: Fix Linting Issues in Utility Scripts

## Overview

We've addressed various linting issues in utility scripts across the project to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. The fixes focused on replacing console.log statements with structured logging, refactoring complex functions, fixing type issues, and improving code organization.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Replaced Console Logs with Structured Logging

Replaced all console.log statements with proper structured logging in these files:

- **scripts/debug/debugAssetUrls.ts**

  - Created a debug-specific logger with proper context
  - Replaced all console statements with logger.info/error calls
  - Structured log messages with proper context objects

- **scripts/verify-standardized-urls.ts**
  - Created a verification-specific logger with request ID
  - Replaced all console statements with structured logging
  - Added child loggers with proper context for URL testing and book verification

### 2. Refactored Complex Functions

Reduced function complexity below the maximum allowed limit of 10:

- **scripts/runTextStandardizationMigration.ts**

  - Refactored the main function by breaking it into smaller helper functions:
    - `loadFilesFromMigrationData`
    - `extractPathsFromMigrationData`
    - `loadFilesFromTranslations`
    - `extractPathsFromChapters`
    - `processFilesInBatches`
    - `generateMigrationSummary`
  - Reduced nesting depth by using early returns and helper functions

- **scripts/standardizeTextFilesBlob.ts**
  - Refactored `processMigrationData` by breaking it into smaller functions:
    - `getFilteredBookNames`
    - `processBookData`
    - `processFileInfo`
    - `isValidTextFilePath`
  - Improved readability with helper functions and meaningful comments
  - Fixed non-null assertions and other type issues

### 3. Fixed Type Issues

Addressed TypeScript type issues:

- Fixed "any" types in verify-standardized-urls.ts by using proper Logger types
- Fixed non-null assertions in standardizeTextFilesBlob.ts
- Improved TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

### 4. Improved Code Organization

- Added JSDoc comments to clarify function purposes
- Structured code with better separation of concerns
- Used consistent patterns for error handling and logging
- Improved variable naming for better readability

## Benefits

1. **Improved Debugging**: Structured logging enables better filtering and analysis of logs
2. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to understand and modify
3. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types reduce runtime errors
4. **Consistent Code Style**: All utility scripts now follow the same patterns and standards

## Next Steps

1. The fixed code passes ESLint checks with no warnings or errors
2. Some tests are failing due to module format incompatibilities (ESM vs CommonJS), which should be addressed in a follow-up task
3. Further linting improvements could be made to additional scripts as part of future maintenance
