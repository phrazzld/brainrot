# T035 Summary: Fix Linting Issues in Utility Scripts

## Overview

We've addressed various linting issues in utility scripts across the project to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. The fixes focused on replacing console.log statements with structured logging, refactoring complex functions, fixing type issues, and improving code organization.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Replaced Console Logs with Structured Logging

Replaced console.log statements with proper structured logging in these files:

- **scripts/checkBlobUrl.ts**
  - Created a script-specific logger with proper context
  - Replaced all console statements with logger.info/error calls
  - Structured log messages with proper context objects

- **scripts/checkMissingAudio.ts**
  - Refactored to use structured logger 
  - Improved code organization by breaking into smaller functions
  - Added comprehensive type definitions

- **scripts/migrateFullAudiobooks.ts**
  - Added structured logging for all system operations
  - Maintained some console.log statements for CLI output with explanatory comments
  - Enhanced error handling with proper logger context

- **scripts/standardizeTextFilesBlob.ts**
  - Fixed remaining console.error usages
  - Improved error reporting with proper context

### 2. Refactored Complex Functions

Reduced function complexity by breaking larger functions into smaller, focused ones:

- **scripts/checkMissingAudio.ts**
  - Refactored into smaller, focused functions:
    - `collectExpectedAudioFiles()`
    - `collectActualAudioFiles()`
    - `findMissingFiles()`
    - `findUnexpectedFiles()`
    - `reportFindings()`
    - `saveResultsToFile()`

- **scripts/standardizeTextFilesBlob.ts**
  - Improved error handling with proper context
  - Used structured logging throughout
  - Enhanced code organization

### 3. Fixed Type Issues

Addressed TypeScript type issues across utility scripts:

- Added proper interfaces for script data structures
- Added proper return types to functions 
- Used structured typing for log messages
- Improved error type checking with `error instanceof Error`

### 4. Improved Code Organization and Configuration

- Updated `.eslintignore` to include only scripts still being actively developed:
  - Removed scripts that have been fixed
  - Kept only debug, test-utils, and certain specific scripts
  - Added clear categories and comments

- Updated `eslint.config.js` to match the same ignore patterns for consistency

- Fixed potential issues with unhandled promises

## Benefits

1. **Improved Debugging**: Structured logging enables better filtering and analysis of logs
2. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to understand and modify
3. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types reduce runtime errors
4. **Consistent Code Style**: All utility scripts now follow the same patterns and standards

## Testing and Validation

- Ran `npm run lint` to verify the changes fixed the linting issues
- Verified that scripts still function correctly
- Confirmed all utility scripts are now using the structured logger

## Next Steps

- Future work could include:
  - Refactoring the remaining complex functions in the ProxyService
  - Adding more extensive test coverage
  - Further standardizing the script patterns
  - Creating helper utilities for common script operations

## Conclusion

This task has improved code quality by ensuring consistent logging patterns, proper error handling, and better code organization across utility scripts. These changes will make future development, debugging, and monitoring more efficient.
