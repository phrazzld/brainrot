# T210 Plan: Perform Actual Cleanup

## Task Description
Run `npx tsx scripts/cleanupLocalAssets.ts --delete` to remove local assets that have been successfully migrated to Blob storage.

## Implementation Approach
1. First, review the `cleanupLocalAssets.ts` script to understand its functionality and the `--delete` flag behavior
2. Ensure we have a backup of the data or that the script has proper safeguards
3. Run the script with the `--delete` flag
4. Verify successful execution and review the resulting log/report
5. Validate that only the intended files were deleted

## Steps to Execute

### Step 1: Examine the script
Review the `cleanupLocalAssets.ts` script to understand its implementation and behavior with the `--delete` flag.

### Step 2: Run the script
Execute the script with the `--delete` flag to perform the actual cleanup:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/cleanupLocalAssets.ts --delete
```

### Step 3: Verification
- Analyze the script output to confirm the correct files were deleted
- Check that only assets that exist in Blob storage were removed
- Verify the generated report contains accurate information

### Step 4: Finalize
- Mark T210 as complete in TODO.md
- Commit changes with an appropriate commit message
