## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt
Please analyze the task to fix linting issues in script files that are blocking git push operations. The task involves addressing several specific issues across multiple files:

1. Replacing console.log statements with structured logger
2. Reducing function complexity in identified functions
3. Fixing max-depth issues in nested blocks
4. Updating husky configuration to address deprecation warnings

For each subtask:
- Examine current implementation patterns
- Identify code quality issues based on ESLint configuration
- Propose specific refactoring approaches for each file
- Consider the project's development philosophy regarding code quality
- Recommend a structured approach for testing changes

The task should be implemented in a way that maintains functionality while improving code quality to pass linting checks. I need a clear understanding of the existing patterns, the specific linting rules being violated, and a methodical approach to address each issue type.
