# T271: Create `.prettierignore` file for build artifacts and dependencies - Completion Report

## Task Description
Create a `.prettierignore` file that excludes build artifacts, dependencies, and other files that don't need to be formatted by Prettier.

## Completed Actions
- Analyzed existing `.gitignore` file for relevant patterns
- Identified additional file types and directories that should be excluded from formatting
- Created comprehensive `.prettierignore` file with appropriate patterns
- Tested the configuration by running Prettier check against the codebase

## Result
Successfully created a `.prettierignore` file that excludes:
- Dependencies (node_modules, package manager files)
- Build outputs (.next, out, build, dist)
- Testing artifacts (coverage, snapshots)
- Generated files and reports (JSON reports, logs)
- Environment and configuration files (.env)
- Large migration JSON files
- Cache and temporary files

## Note on Import Order Warning
During testing, I noticed warnings about `importOrder` being an unknown option in the Prettier configuration. This indicates that the `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` or equivalent plugin needs to be installed to support the import ordering functionality configured in `.prettierrc.js`. This should be addressed in a subsequent task.

## Next Steps
1. Update the TODO.md file to mark T271 as complete
2. Proceed with the next task: "Add Prettier npm script to package.json"
