# T051: Fix linting issues in migration scripts

## Task Summary

This task involved fixing linting issues in migration scripts, specifically:

1. Replacing console.log statements with structured loggers
2. Fixing any/unknown type usage
3. Refactoring complex functions
4. Fixing max-depth violations

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved structured logging

- Replaced all direct console output with structured logger calls
- Added proper context to log messages
- Created specialized logging methods for better organization

### 2. Enhanced type safety

- Replaced generic `Record<string, unknown>` with proper interfaces
- Added proper error type handling throughout the codebase
- Fixed type assertions in error handling logic

### 3. Function complexity reduction

- Split large functions into smaller, focused helper methods
- Extracted complex logic into dedicated functions with clear responsibilities
- Improved function signatures with better parameter types

### 4. Code organization improvements

- Reduced nesting depth in complex functions
- Created utility methods to handle common operations
- Improved readability with consistent method naming and structure

## Files Modified

- `scripts/migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.ts` - Updated with structured logging, improved types, and reduced complexity
- `scripts/migrateBookCoverImages.ts` - Updated with structured logging, improved types, and reduced complexity

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding unit tests for the migration scripts
- Create shared utility functions for common migration operations
- Add more detailed performance metrics for migration operations
