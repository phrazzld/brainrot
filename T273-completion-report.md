# T273: Configure Prettier/ESLint Integration to Avoid Conflicts - Completion Report

## Task Description
Configure the integration between ESLint and Prettier to avoid conflicts, ensuring they work together harmoniously rather than having overlapping or contradictory rules.

## Completed Actions
1. Updated ESLint configuration to extend Prettier:
   - Added `"prettier"` to the `extends` array in `.eslintrc.json`
   - Added `"prettier"` to the `plugins` array
   - Added the `"prettier/prettier"` rule to enforce Prettier formatting

2. Resolved issues with Prettier plugin loading in ESM environment:
   - Created `.prettierrc.cjs` instead of `.prettierrc.js` to support CommonJS module loading
   - Explicitly required and configured the `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` plugin
   - Added additional import order configuration options

3. Created modern ESLint flat config file for v9 compatibility:
   - Added `eslint.config.js` that extends the existing `.eslintrc.json` configuration
   - Used `@eslint/eslintrc` to bridge between the legacy and flat config formats
   - Added appropriate file ignores

## Implementation Details
- Changed `jsxBracketSameLine` to `bracketSameLine` to resolve deprecated option warning
- Added `importOrderSeparation`, `importOrderSortSpecifiers`, and `importOrderGroupNamespaceSpecifiers` options
- Explicitly defined the plugins array in the Prettier configuration
- Configured ESLint to respect the Prettier configuration with `{ usePrettierrc: true }`

## Testing Results
- ESLint successfully lints files with the new configuration
- Prettier correctly formats files with import ordering working
- The integration works properly with no conflicting rules

## Observed Issues for Future Tasks
- Some ESLint warnings in `getBlobUrl.ts` regarding complexity and console statements
- One ESLint error about unused variables
- These should be addressed in a separate code quality task

## Next Steps
1. Update the TODO.md file to mark T273 as complete
2. Consider creating a task to fix the ESLint issues identified during testing
