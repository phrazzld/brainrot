# T219 Plan: Create Audio Download Utility

## Task Description
Create a utility function to download audio files from Digital Ocean Spaces based on URLs in translations file.

## Context
- Audio files are stored in Digital Ocean Spaces
- URLs for these files are referenced in the translations file
- Previous migration attempts created placeholder files in Vercel Blob storage instead of actual audio files
- We need to download the actual audio files from Digital Ocean Spaces as a first step in proper migration

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a utility function in a new file `utils/downloadFromSpaces.ts`
2. The function should:
   - Accept a Digital Ocean Spaces URL as input
   - Download the file content
   - Return the file content as a Buffer or Blob for later upload to Vercel Blob
   - Include proper error handling
   - Support logging for tracking download progress

3. Add support for handling authentication if required by Digital Ocean Spaces 
4. Create a test for the utility function

## Technical Notes
- Use the Node.js Fetch API for downloading
- Need to read environment variables for any required DO Spaces credentials
- Should handle retry logic for robust downloads
- Need to check how URLs are stored in translations file to ensure proper parsing
