# T033: Run T032 text file standardization migration in production - Summary

## Objective

Deploy and execute the text file standardization migration in production to ensure all text files follow the standardized naming conventions.

## Implementation

### 1. Production Migration Script

- Created `scripts/runTextStandardizationMigration.ts` to actually copy files (not just log)
- Implemented proper blob storage operations with `uploadText` method
- Added concurrency control for efficient batch processing
- Comprehensive error handling and progress tracking

### 2. URL Generation Updates

- Enhanced `utils/getBlobUrl.ts` with proper path conversion logic
- Updated `getAssetUrl` function to handle different asset path patterns:
  - Standard paths: `/assets/text/hamlet/brainrot-act-01.txt`
  - Non-standard paths: `/assets/the-iliad/text/book-01.txt`
  - Image paths: `/assets/hamlet/images/hamlet-07.png`
- Ensured backward compatibility with legacy paths

### 3. Migration Execution

- Successfully migrated **179 text files** from legacy to standardized paths
- Migration completed in ~14 seconds with 0 failures
- Created detailed JSON reports of migration results
- Verified all standardized URLs are accessible in production

### 4. Code Fixes

- Fixed TypeScript errors and linting issues
- Removed unused error parameter in catch blocks
- Properly typed migration data structures
- Updated CHANGELOG and TODO.md with accomplishments

## Results

- All text files now accessible at standardized blob paths
- URL generation correctly handles both standard and legacy patterns
- Fallback mechanism ensures backward compatibility
- Production verification shows all assets are properly served

## Next Steps

1. Application needs restart to pick up new URL generation logic
2. Monitor production for any asset loading issues
3. Eventually remove legacy file locations after successful transition
4. Continue with image and audio asset standardization
