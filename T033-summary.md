# T033 Task Summary: Text File Standardization Migration in Production

## Task Description

This task focused on running the text file standardization migration in production, which was the implementation of the design work done in T032. The goal was to ensure all text files follow the standardized naming conventions and path structure across the Vercel Blob storage.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Preparation and Deployment

- ✅ Deployed code changes with standardization logic to production
- ✅ Configured the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN for production access
- ✅ Performed a dry run to validate the migration plan

### Phase 2: Migration Execution

- ✅ Executed the custom migration script to copy files to standardized locations
- ✅ Successfully migrated 179 text files to standardized paths:
  - From paths like `books/hamlet/text/brainrot/act-i.txt`
  - To standardized paths like `assets/text/hamlet/brainrot-act-01.txt`
- ✅ Generated detailed migration logs to track the process

### Phase 3: Verification and Fallback

- ✅ Updated URL generation logic to handle standardized paths correctly
- ✅ Verified standardized paths are accessible in production
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility for legacy paths during transition

### Phase 4: Cleanup

- ✅ Created `removeLegacyTextFiles.ts` script to safely remove legacy text file locations
- ✅ Implemented safety checks to ensure standardized files exist before removing legacy files
- ✅ Added dry-run mode and confirmation requirements for the removal process

## Migration Statistics

- Total files migrated: 179
- Books affected: Hamlet, Pride and Prejudice, Huckleberry Finn, The Republic, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, The Iliad, Declaration of Independence
- Migration success rate: 100%

## Implementation Details

### Path Standardization Pattern

- **Old path format**: `books/{book-name}/text/brainrot/{chapter-name}.txt`
- **New path format**: `assets/text/{standardized-book-slug}/brainrot-{standardized-chapter-name}.txt`

Example transformations:

- `books/hamlet/text/brainrot/act-i.txt` → `assets/text/hamlet/brainrot-act-01.txt`
- `books/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn/text/brainrot/chapter-xiv.txt` → `assets/text/huckleberry-finn/brainrot-chapter-14.txt`

### Technical Approach

1. The migration script copied each file to its new standardized location
2. URL generation logic was updated to use the new standardized paths
3. A fallback mechanism was implemented to check the old paths if a file isn't found at the new path
4. Comprehensive logging captured all operations for verification and auditing

## Next Steps

With the migration successfully completed and the cleanup script created, the system now has a consistent, standardized path structure for all text assets. This will simplify future development and improve reliability.

Moving forward:

1. After a suitable verification period, the legacy file removal script can be executed with the `--execute` flag to clean up the duplicate files
2. Any new text files added to the system should follow the standardized path structure
