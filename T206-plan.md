# T206 Run Verification Script

## Analysis

The task involves running the `verifyBlobStorage.ts` script to confirm all required assets were successfully migrated to Blob storage. 

Looking at the verification script, it:
1. Iterates through all books in the `translations` array
2. Checks if each book's cover image exists in Blob storage
3. Checks if each chapter's text exists in Blob storage
4. Checks if each audio file (if available) exists in Blob storage
5. Generates a summary report of migrated vs. missing assets
6. Saves the report to a JSON file in a `reports` directory

The script relies on the `assetExistsInBlobStorage` function from `utils/getBlobUrl.ts`, which makes HEAD requests to the Blob storage to check if files exist.

Unlike the migration scripts, the verification script doesn't import dotenv to load environment variables, but it probably should since it needs to access Blob storage.

## Plan

1. Check if the verification script needs access to environment variables (dotenv)
2. Add dotenv import if needed
3. Run the script
4. Review the report
5. Mark the task as completed in TODO.md

## Implementation Steps

1. Add dotenv import to verifyBlobStorage.ts if needed
2. Run the script: `npx tsx scripts/verifyBlobStorage.ts`
3. Examine the report to confirm the migration was successful
4. Update TODO.md to mark T206 as completed
