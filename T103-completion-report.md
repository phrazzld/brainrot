# T103: Resolve reported installation issues - Completion Report

## Summary

I have successfully completed task T103 to resolve the installation issues in the project. The primary issue was related to peer dependency conflicts between React 19.x and packages requiring React 18.x, as identified in task T102.

## Changes Implemented

1. Added "engines" field to package.json to specify Node.js version 22.x or newer
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=22.0.0"
   }
   ```

2. Added documentation in package.json about the need for `--legacy-peer-deps`
   ```json
   "// NOTE": "This project requires --legacy-peer-deps to install due to React 19 compatibility issues with @testing-library/react"
   ```

3. Added a convenience npm script for setting up the project with legacy peer deps
   ```json
   "setup": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
   ```

4. Added PNPM configuration for handling peer dependency conflicts (for users of pnpm)
   ```json
   "installConfig": {
     "pnpm": {
       "peerDependencyRules": {
         "allowedVersions": {
           "react": "19"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Updated Next.js version from 15.1.3 to at least 15.3.1 to address a critical security vulnerability
   ```json
   "next": "^15.3.1"
   ```

6. Regenerated package-lock.json with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

## Testing and Verification

1. Verified that `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` completes successfully
2. Updated Next.js to fix a critical security vulnerability found by npm audit
3. Verified that the project builds successfully
4. Tested the application to ensure it functions as expected

## Conclusion

The installation issues have been successfully resolved by:
1. Properly specifying the required Node.js version
2. Documenting the need for `--legacy-peer-deps`
3. Adding a convenience script for installation
4. Updating to a more secure version of Next.js

These changes will make it easier to set up the project locally and also prepare it for integration with Vercel, which depends on this information for deployment.

## Next Steps for T104

For T104, we need to configure legacy peer-deps install in Vercel settings by setting the install command to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the project settings.
