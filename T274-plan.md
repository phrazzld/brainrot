# T274: Install Jest and React Testing Library

## Task Description
Install Jest and React Testing Library packages to enable testing for the project.

## Current State Analysis
Looking at the project, these testing packages might already be installed since there are test files in the `__tests__` directory and a jest.config.cjs file exists. We need to verify what's already in place before installing new packages.

## Implementation Approach
1. Check existing package.json for Jest and React Testing Library dependencies
2. Examine existing jest.config.cjs to understand current configuration
3. Check existing test files to understand current testing patterns
4. Install any missing packages with appropriate versions
5. Ensure all needed packages are installed with the correct versions:
   - jest
   - @jest/globals
   - @testing-library/react
   - @testing-library/jest-dom
   - jest-environment-jsdom
   - ts-jest (for TypeScript support)

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze current project setup and existing testing infrastructure
2. Install any missing dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps flag (needed for React 19 compatibility)
3. Verify that the packages are correctly installed and compatible
4. Run an existing test to verify functionality
5. Document any special configurations needed for React 19 compatibility
