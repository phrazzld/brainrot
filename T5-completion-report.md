# T5 Completion Report: Associate Form Labels with Controls

## Task Description
Update all `<label>` elements flagged by `jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control` to use `htmlFor` with matching `id` attributes on inputs or to wrap the form control inside the label.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified all label elements lacking proper associations with their form controls, primarily in:
   - `/app/translate/page.tsx`
   - `/app/reading-room/[slug]/page.tsx`

2. Fixed issues by adding:
   - `htmlFor` attributes to all label elements
   - Corresponding `id` attributes to their associated form controls

3. Specifically fixed the following instances:
   - In `/app/translate/page.tsx`:
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for password input
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for model selection
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for query input
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for notes input

   - In `/app/reading-room/[slug]/page.tsx`:
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for share modal checkboxes (include chapter, include timestamp)
     - Added id/htmlFor pairs for share URL input field

4. Verified that no `jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control` issues remain using ESLint

## Accessibility Benefits
- Screen readers can now correctly announce the relationship between labels and form controls
- Clicking on labels now correctly focuses or activates the associated form control
- Users with mobility impairments have larger clickable areas for interacting with form elements
- Improved keyboard navigation and focus management

## Verification
- Ran `npx eslint --rule 'jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control:error'` to verify all issues were resolved
- Manually tested label clicks to ensure they properly focus the associated form controls

## Next Steps
With T5 complete, T6 (Refactor Long Functions to Reduce Length) is now unblocked and can be implemented.
