# T215: Diagnose asset verification discrepancies

## Task Description
Investigate why verification reports show incomplete migration despite completed migration tasks. Check URL formats and paths between migration and verification scripts.

## Classification
This is a **Simple** task as it involves investigating a specific issue around URL formats and path handling between scripts, with a clear scope.

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine the verification script to understand how it verifies assets
2. Examine how the asset URLs are stored in translations object
3. Review the URL handling in getBlobUrl.ts which was identified as having a mismatch issue
4. Identify the exact nature of the URL mismatch between:
   - URLs in translations file: https://public.blob.vercel-storage.com
   - Actual Blob storage URL: https://82qos1wlxbd4iq1g.public.blob.vercel-storage.com
5. Determine whether the issue is with:
   - The verification script
   - The migration script
   - The translations object
   - The URL handling logic
6. Create a fix plan based on the diagnosis

## Implementation Strategy
1. Run the verification script to see the exact failures
2. Check how URL comparisons are made during verification
3. Review the migration scripts to see how they're setting URLs
4. Test the fix to ensure verification passes
