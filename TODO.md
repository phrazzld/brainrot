# Complete Migration from Digital Ocean to Vercel Blob

## Overview

This TODO list details the tasks required to fully migrate all asset management from Digital Ocean Spaces to Vercel Blob. Our verification has revealed path inconsistencies between the two systems and a complex dual-provider approach that's causing reliability issues. This migration will simplify our architecture, improve reliability, and reduce maintenance overhead.
