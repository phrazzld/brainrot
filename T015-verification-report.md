# T015: Signed URL Expiry Configuration Verification Report

## Overview
This report documents the verification of the signed URL expiry configuration in the `s3SignedUrlGenerator.ts` file. The focus is on ensuring that the expiry time is configured securely and is loaded appropriately from environment variables.

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current implementation in `s3SignedUrlGenerator.ts` includes the following features related to expiry configuration:

1. **Default Configuration Value:**
   - A default expiry time of 900 seconds (15 minutes) is defined in the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` object.
   ```typescript
   const DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
     region: 'us-east-1',
     expirySeconds: 900, // 15 minutes
   };
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The expiry time is configurable via the `SPACES_EXPIRY_SECONDS` environment variable.
   - If the environment variable is not set, the default value from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` is used.
   ```typescript
   // Configure URL expiry time with fallback to default
   const configuredExpiry = process.env.SPACES_EXPIRY_SECONDS;
   this.expirySeconds = configuredExpiry
     ? parseInt(configuredExpiry, 10)
     : DEFAULT_CONFIG.expirySeconds;
   ```

3. **Validation and Security Measures:**
   - There's validation to ensure the expiry time is a valid positive number.
   - There's a maximum limit of 7 days (AWS SDK's maximum allowed value) to prevent excessive expiry times, which is a good security practice.
   ```typescript
   // Validate expiry is a reasonable number
   const MAX_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 7 days (AWS SDK max)
   if (isNaN(this.expirySeconds) || this.expirySeconds <= 0) {
     this.expirySeconds = DEFAULT_CONFIG.expirySeconds;
   } else if (this.expirySeconds > MAX_EXPIRY_SECONDS) {
     // Cap the expiry time to the maximum allowed
     this.expirySeconds = MAX_EXPIRY_SECONDS;
   }
   ```

4. **Usage in URL Generation:**
   - The configured expiry time is used when generating signed URLs via the AWS SDK:
   ```typescript
   // Generate the signed URL with the configured expiry
   const signedUrl = await getSignedUrl(this.s3Client, command, {
     expiresIn: this.expirySeconds,
   });
   ```

5. **Test Coverage:**
   - Tests exist for default expiry when not provided
   - Tests exist for using default expiry when an invalid value is provided
   - Tests exist for using the provided expiry value from environment variables

## Evaluation

1. **Environment Variable Loading: ✅ SECURE**
   - Expiry time is correctly loaded from the `SPACES_EXPIRY_SECONDS` environment variable.
   - There's a fallback to a reasonable default of 15 minutes if the environment variable is not set.

2. **Validation: ✅ SECURE**
   - Invalid expiry values (NaN, negative, zero) are handled by falling back to the default.
   - There's a maximum cap of 7 days to prevent excessively long expiry times.

3. **Default Configuration: ✅ APPROPRIATE**
   - The default expiry time of 15 minutes (900 seconds) is reasonable for this application.
   - It strikes a balance between security (short expiry) and usability (enough time for users to download files).

4. **Test Coverage: ✅ ADEQUATE**
   - Tests exist for various expiry configuration scenarios.
   - Tests verify that the configured expiry is correctly passed to the AWS SDK.

5. **Documentation: ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT NEEDED**
   - The `SPACES_EXPIRY_SECONDS` environment variable is not documented in the existing documentation files.
   - This makes it harder for developers to know about and configure this option.

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update the relevant documentation files (like `DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS.md`) to include information about the `SPACES_EXPIRY_SECONDS` environment variable.
   - Document the default value, the maximum allowed value, and the purpose of this configuration.

2. **No Code Changes Required:**
   - The current implementation of expiry time configuration is secure and well-designed.
   - It follows best practices like environment variable loading, validation, having sensible defaults, and imposing maximum limits.
   - No code changes are necessary for the `s3SignedUrlGenerator.ts` file with respect to expiry configuration.

## Conclusion

The signed URL expiry configuration in `s3SignedUrlGenerator.ts` is secure and properly implemented. The only improvement needed is documentation to make the configuration option more discoverable for developers. The default value of 15 minutes is appropriate for the application's needs and is aligned with security best practices for signed URLs.
