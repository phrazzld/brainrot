# T034 Summary: Specific Cover Images for Coming Soon Books

## Verification Completed

We've verified that all books, including those with "coming soon" status, are already using specific cover images in the translation files and the implementation is working correctly.

## Key Findings

1. Book translation files (e.g., `/translations/books/paradise-lost.ts`) correctly use `getAssetUrl()` to obtain the proper image URL:

   ```typescript
   coverImage: getAssetUrl('/assets/paradise-lost/images/paradise-lost-01.png', USE_BLOB_STORAGE);
   ```

2. The asset path mapping in `utils/assetPathMapping.ts` includes entries for all coming soon books, which correctly map legacy paths to standardized blob paths.

3. The explore page code correctly renders these images and applies appropriate styling for coming soon books (grayscale effect and "Coming Soon" button).

4. All "coming soon" books are following the standardized naming pattern defined in our asset service.

## Implementation

No implementation changes were needed as the system was already correctly using specific cover images for all books, both available and coming soon. The existing code ensures that:

1. Cover images are properly displayed on the explore page
2. Paths are standardized according to our asset service conventions
3. Images are served from Vercel Blob storage with appropriate caching

## Next Steps

The task is now complete. We're continuing to follow the best practice of using specific, custom cover images for each book, even those marked as "coming soon", rather than using a generic placeholder.

Future considerations:

- Continue to ensure new books follow the same pattern
- Consider adding automated testing to validate cover image paths for all books
