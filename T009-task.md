# T009: Implement Unified Asset Service

## Original Ticket

**T009: Implement Unified Asset Service**

- Create new service class implementing the designed interface
- Support only Vercel Blob as the storage backend
- Include detailed logging of all operations
- Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Dependencies: T003, T008

## Implementation Summary

I have implemented a unified asset service that conforms to the interface designed in T003 and verified in T008. The implementation successfully:

1. Supports only Vercel Blob as the storage backend (removing DO support)
2. Includes detailed structured logging of all operations
3. Implements robust error handling with retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Adheres to TypeScript best practices and development philosophy

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/utils/services/VercelBlobAssetService.ts` - Main service implementation
2. `/utils/services/AssetServiceFactory.ts` - Factory for creating service instances
3. `/utils/services/index.ts` - Updated to export the new service
4. `/__tests__/services/VercelBlobAssetService.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Service Backend**: Implements the `AssetService` interface using Vercel Blob SDK as the backend.
2. **Path Management**: Utilizes AssetPathService for consistent path generation.
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations include detailed entry, success, and error logging.
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Custom error classes with specific error types and contextual information.
5. **Retry Mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff for transient failures.
6. **Dependency Injection**: Service instances can be created with custom configurations and dependencies.
7. **Singleton Pattern**: A default service instance is exported for use throughout the application.
8. **Full Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covers all primary functionality.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the design specified in `/docs/ASSET_SERVICE_DESIGN.md` and adheres to the interfaces defined in `/types/assets.ts`. Key highlights:

1. **Service Construction**: The service requires an AssetPathService for path generation, optional configuration, and an optional logger.
2. **Asset Operations**: Implements all required operations (getAssetUrl, assetExists, fetchAsset, fetchTextAsset, uploadAsset, deleteAsset, listAssets).
3. **Error Handling**: Catches and normalizes all errors, converting them to AssetError with appropriate error types and context.
4. **Retries**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures during network operations.
5. **Cache Control**: Supports cache busting options for asset URLs.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created that verifies:

- All API methods function correctly
- Error handling works as expected
- Retry mechanisms are effective
- Configuration options are properly applied

All tests are passing, ensuring the service is ready for integration with the rest of the application.
