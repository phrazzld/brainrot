# T1 Completion Report: Setup Local Development Environment

## Environment Setup

- **Node.js Version**: v23.7.0 (meets requirement `>=22.0.0`)
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies installed successfully with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- **ESLint Configuration**: Verified `.eslintrc.json` contains strict rules as documented in the `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`

## ESLint Errors Verification

Running `npm run lint` successfully reproduced the ESLint errors reported in the CI pipeline:

### Error Types Confirmed
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` - Using `any` type without being more specific
- `max-lines-per-function` - Functions exceed the maximum allowed lines (100)
- `complexity` - Functions exceed maximum allowed complexity (10)
- `jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control` - Form labels not properly associated with controls
- `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` - Click handlers missing keyboard event handlers
- `no-console` - Unexpected console statements (only warn/error allowed)
- `max-params` - Functions with too many parameters (max 4)
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` - Unused variables/imports

### Affected Files Confirmed
1. `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - 11 issues (7 errors, 4 warnings)
2. `/app/reading-room/[slug]/page.tsx` - 13 issues (6 errors, 7 warnings)
3. `/app/translate/page.tsx` - 10 issues (7 errors, 3 warnings)
4. `/app/blob-verification/page.tsx` - 2 issues (2 warnings)
5. `/components/DownloadButton.tsx` - 2 issues (1 error related to unused import, 1 error related to any type)

## Conclusion

The local development environment has been successfully set up, and I was able to reproduce all ESLint errors that were causing the CI build failure. The environment is now ready for implementing fixes for these ESLint violations according to the subsequent tasks (T2-T11).

The ESLint errors match exactly what was reported in BUG.md and ci-failure-audit.md, confirming we're addressing the correct issues.
