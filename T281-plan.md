# T281: Fix TypeScript Errors in Test Files

## Task Overview
Resolve the syntax errors in migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts and any other files with TypeScript errors, focusing on making tests pass.

## Methodology
1. First, we'll identify all TypeScript errors in test files:
   - Run TypeScript type checking on all test files
   - Examine the specific error in migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts
   - Look for patterns or common issues across multiple files

2. Categorize the errors:
   - Type definition issues
   - Import/export errors
   - Syntax errors related to TypeScript features
   - ESM vs CommonJS conflicts
   - React-specific TypeScript errors

3. For each error:
   - Understand the root cause
   - Determine the appropriate fix
   - Apply the fix
   - Verify the error is resolved

4. Initially focus on the explicitly mentioned migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts file before addressing other files.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Examine migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts
- Read the file to understand its purpose and structure
- Run TypeScript compiler on it to get detailed error messages
- Understand the underlying functionality being tested

### 2. Fix migrateAudioFilesEnhanced.test.ts
- Apply appropriate fixes based on error types
- Test to ensure the file now compiles successfully
- Run the test to make sure it passes functionally

### 3. Identify additional files with TypeScript errors
- Run TypeScript compiler on all test files
- Make a list of files with errors

### 4. Fix additional files
- Apply similar patterns and fixes to other files with errors
- Ensure all files compile without TypeScript errors
- Verify tests are passing

### 5. Verify that all fixes are consistent
- Ensure the fixes follow the same patterns and coding standards
- Verify that no new issues are introduced
- Make sure all tests run successfully

## Success Criteria
- No TypeScript errors in any test files
- All tests run successfully
- No regression in existing functionality
- Consistent code style and patterns across all fixes
