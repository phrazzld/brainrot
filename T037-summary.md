# T037: Linting Issue Resolution Summary

## Completed Work

1. **Updated Husky Configuration for v10 Compatibility**
   - Removed deprecated `#!/usr/bin/env sh` line from pre-commit and pre-push hooks
   - Removed `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"` line from hooks
   - Enabled hooks with proper commands for linting and type checking
   - Made hook files executable

2. **Logger Refactoring**
   - Replaced console.log statements with structured logger in:
     - `cleanupLocalAssets.ts`
     - `migrateAudioFiles.ts`
     - `verifyAudioMigration.ts`
     - `verifyBlobStorage.ts`
     - `verifyAudioMigrationWithContent.ts`
     - Fixed logger import in `verifyTextMigration.ts`

3. **Complexity Reduction**
   - Refactored complex functions into smaller, more focused helper functions:
     - `cleanupLocalAssets.ts`: Split main function into `updateCounters`, `processChapterAssets`, `processBookAssets`, and `saveCleanupReport`
     - `verifyAudioMigration.ts`: Added `checkAudioFileExists`, `verifyAudioFile`, `verifyBookAudio`, and `saveVerificationReport`
     - `verifyBlobStorage.ts`: Extracted `verifyAsset`, `verifyBookAssets`, `calculateOverallSummary` helper functions
     - `verifyAudioMigrationWithContent.ts`: Added `getBlobUrlForAudioPath`, `isValidAudioFile`, `verifyAudioFile`, etc.

4. **Max-Depth Improvements**
   - Fixed excessive nesting in `verifyAudioMigrationWithContent.ts` by refactoring into smaller functions
   - Fixed nesting in `verifyBlobStorage.ts` by restructuring file and function flow
   - Fixed nesting in `verifyTextMigration.ts`

## Remaining Issues

Some linting issues remain to be addressed:

1. **No-console Rule Violations**
   - Interactive CLI sections still using console.log for user prompts (e.g., cleanupLocalAssets.ts)

2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Module import syntax issues (default exports vs named imports)
   - import.meta.url usage incompatibility with current TypeScript configuration
   - Unused variables needing underscore prefixes

3. **Additional Linting Warnings**
   - Remaining complexity issues in some functions
   - Max-depth issues in `verifyTextMigration.ts`
   - Unnecessary escape characters in regex expressions

## Next Steps

A new task (T038) has been created to address these remaining issues:

1. Properly handle console statements needed for CLI interaction
2. Fix TypeScript module import styles across scripts
3. Address unused variables with proper underscore prefixes
4. Fix the remaining complexity and max-depth issues
5. Update .eslintignore configuration to modern format

These issues should be addressed systematically to ensure full compatibility with the project's linting rules.
