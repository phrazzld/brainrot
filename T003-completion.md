# T003: CDN URL Verification Tool - Completion Report

## Summary

Task T003 has been successfully completed. We've developed a comprehensive CDN URL verification tool that can test URL generation and accessibility across different environments to help diagnose download issues.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **CDN URL Generation Testing**

   - Verifies URLs are correctly formatted with proper bucket and region
   - Tests both full book and chapter audio URLs
   - Compares actual URL structure against expected patterns

2. **URL Accessibility Testing**

   - Performs HEAD requests to check if URLs are accessible
   - Captures HTTP status codes, response headers, and error details
   - Measures response times for performance analysis
   - Includes timeout handling and error reporting

3. **Storage Provider Testing**

   - Tests CDN URLs (Digital Ocean CDN)
   - Tests non-CDN fallback URLs
   - Tests Vercel Blob storage availability

4. **Environment Comparison**

   - Compares results between environments (development vs. production)
   - Compares results with previous test runs
   - Generates detailed difference reports

5. **Flexible Reporting**
   - Supports both JSON and Markdown output formats
   - Generates summary statistics and detailed test results
   - Includes configuration information for diagnostics
   - Visualizes results with tables and status indicators

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/verifyCdnUrls.ts` - The main verification script
- `docs/CDN_URL_VERIFICATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation for the tool
- `__tests__/scripts/verifyCdnUrls.test.ts` - Basic test for the script
- `package.json` - Added npm scripts for running the verification
- `TODO.md` - Updated to mark T003 as completed
- `BACKLOG.md` - Added the CDN URL verification tool as a completed feature

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
npm run verify:cdn

# Generate markdown report
npm run verify:cdn:md

# Run with verbose output
npm run verify:cdn:verbose

# Compare with previous run
npm run verify:cdn:compare
```

## Advanced Features

- **Command-line options:** Flexible configuration for customizing the verification
- **Concurrency control:** Controls the number of parallel requests
- **Timeout handling:** Configurable timeouts for network requests
- **Sanitized URL logging:** Ensures sensitive information is not exposed
- **Detailed error reporting:** Captures and reports detailed error information
- **Performance metrics:** Tracks response times for performance analysis

## Next Steps

The completion of task T003 enables the execution of task T004: "Run URL verification and document findings", which will use this tool to:

1. Run the verification script in both local and preview environments
2. Document differences in URL generation or accessibility
3. Identify potential environment variable or configuration issues

## Conclusion

The CDN URL verification tool is a comprehensive solution for diagnosing audio download issues related to URL generation and accessibility. It provides detailed insights into how URLs are constructed and accessed across different environments, helping to identify and troubleshoot problems with the download flow.
