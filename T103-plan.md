# T103 Plan: Resolve reported installation issues

## Task Description
Update or add peer dependencies in `package.json`, align the `"engines".node` field with Vercel's Node version, regenerate `package-lock.json`, and commit changes.

## Background
From the completion of T102, we identified that npm install errors were occurring due to peer dependency conflicts between React 19.x and packages requiring React 18.x. We also found that using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag successfully resolved these installation issues.

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine the current package.json to understand the existing dependencies and structure
2. Update the package.json to:
   - Add "engines" field specifying Node.js version (22.x) for Vercel compatibility
   - Document the need for --legacy-peer-deps in the package.json
3. Regenerate package-lock.json using the correct configuration 
4. Test the installation to verify the fix
5. Commit the changes

## Expected Results
The installation process should complete successfully without errors, either by using the --legacy-peer-deps flag or by updating the peer dependencies to be compatible with React 19.x.
