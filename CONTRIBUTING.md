## Development Workflow

### Working with the Monorepo

We use Turborepo for managing our monorepo. Key commands:

```bash
# Run all development servers
pnpm dev

# Build everything
pnpm build

# Build specific workspace
pnpm build --filter=@brainrot/web

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Working on Specific Packages

```bash
# Work on the web app
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Work on a package
cd packages/@brainrot/converter
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Add dependency to root
pnpm add -D typescript

# Add to specific workspace
pnpm add react --filter=@brainrot/web

# Add workspace dependency
pnpm add @brainrot/types --filter=@brainrot/web --workspace
```

test: add converter package tests
chore: update dependencies
```

## Translation Guidelines

### The Brainrot Style

When creating translations:

1. **Keep the plot intact** - We're translating language, not changing stories
2. **Use Gen Z slang naturally** - Don't force it where it doesn't fit
3. **Be funny but respectful** - We're celebrating these works, not mocking them
4. **Maintain readability** - It should still flow as a story
5. **Stay consistent** - Character voices should remain consistent

### Translation Structure

```markdown
# Chapter Title

*[Optional author note or context]*

Main text with Gen Z translation...

---

*[Optional end note or meme reference]*
```

### Example Translation

Original:
> "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since."

Brainrot:
> "back when i was a lil sus beta and way more vulnerable to getting absolutely ratio'd by life, my dad dropped some wisdom that's been living rent-free in my head ever since no cap"

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm test --filter=@brainrot/converter

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Test files should be colocated with source files
- Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions
- Write descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example:
```typescript
describe('stripMarkdown', () => {
  it('should remove markdown formatting while preserving text', () => {
    const input = '**bold** and *italic*';
    const output = stripMarkdown(input);
    expect(output).toBe('bold and italic');
  });
});
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm lint
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Check for secrets**
   ```bash
   # Our pre-commit hooks should catch these
   gitleaks detect --source . -v
   ```

3. **Update documentation** if needed

4. **Add tests** for new features

### PR Template

### Review Process

1. Submit PR against `main` branch
2. Automated checks will run (tests, linting, security)
3. Wait for code review from maintainers
4. Address feedback
5. PR will be merged once approved

## Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use functional components in React
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Use meaningful variable names

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first design
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use CSS variables for theming

### File Organization

```typescript
// 1. Imports (sorted automatically)
import React from 'react';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import { BookType } from '@/types';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface Props {
  book: BookType;
}

// 3. Component/Function
export function BookReader({ book }: Props) {
  // Implementation
}

// 4. Exports
export default BookReader;
```

## Security

### Important Security Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.env.local` for local secrets
   - Check `.env.example` for required variables
   - Run `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` to enable pre-commit scanning

2. **Validate inputs**
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Validate file uploads
   - Check URL parameters

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories
   - Use `pnpm audit` regularly

4. **Report vulnerabilities**
   - Email security issues to: security@brainrot.pub
   - Do NOT open public issues for security problems
   - Include steps to reproduce

## Development Tips

### Useful Scripts

```bash
# Generate formats for a book
pnpm generate:formats great-gatsby

# Sync to blob storage
pnpm sync:blob --all

# Monitor API usage
pnpm monitor

# Open monitoring dashboard
pnpm monitor:dashboard
```

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all available variables. Key ones:
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Required for content storage
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE_URL` - Content delivery URL
- `LULU_API_KEY` - For publishing automation
- `KDP_EMAIL/PASSWORD` - For Amazon publishing

### Debugging

1. Use browser DevTools for frontend issues
2. Add `console.log` or use debugger statements
3. Check `pnpm dev` output for server errors
4. Use `--verbose` flag on CLI commands
5. Check GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all contributors who help make classic literature fire for Gen Z! Special shoutout to the original authors who would probably be very confused but hopefully a little amused by what we're doing.

Remember: We're not trying to replace the originals - we're creating a gateway drug to get Gen Z interested in classic literature. Once they're hooked on our translations, they might just pick up the originals too. That's the dream, no cap fr fr.

Happy contributing! ðŸš€ðŸ“šâœ¨
