i couldn’t sleep all night, fr fr. a foghorn was making a goofy ahh sound on the sound, and i was tossing and turning between grotesque reality and some savage, fnaf-level dreams. toward dawn, i heard a taxi go up gatsby’s drive, and i immediately jumped out of bed and started to get dressed—i felt like i had to tell him something, like a major plot point was about to drop and morning would be too late. it was giving… final boss energy.

crossing his lawn, i saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, looking cooked.

“nothing happened,” he said, his voice all weak and zesty. “i waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”

his house had never seemed so huge to me as it did that night when we were hunting for cigarettes. we pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt around on the dark walls for light switches—once i tripped and made a splash on the keys of a ghostly piano. there was a weird amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, like they hadn’t been aired out in days. i found the humidor on a random table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. we threw open the french windows of the drawing-room and sat there, smoking in the darkness.

"yo, you should literally dip," i said. "fr, it's pretty certain they'll trace your car, bestie."

"dip now, sigma bro?"

"yo, go to atlantic city for a week, or up to montreal, bestie. literally just get out of here, no cap."

he wouldn’t even consider it. he couldn’t possibly leave daisy until he knew what she was going to do. he was clutching at some last hope, and i couldn’t bring myself to tell him it was over.

it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with dan cody—told it to me because “jay gatsby” had shattered like glass against tom’s hard malice, and the long, secret larp was over. i think he would have admitted anything now, without reservation, but he wanted to talk about daisy.

she was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. in various, unrevealed ways, he had come into contact with such people, but always with an invisible barbed wire between them. he found her excitingly desirable. he went to her house, at first with other officers from camp taylor, then alone. it amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. but what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent at camp was to him. there was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. it excited him, too, that many men had already loved daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. he felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

but he knew that he was in daisy’s house by a colossal accident. however glorious his future as jay gatsby might be, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. so he made the most of his time. he took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took daisy one still october night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.

he might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. i don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. as a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.

but he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. he had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. he knew that daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. she vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving gatsby—nothing. he felt married to her, that was all.

when they met again, two days later, it was gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. she had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.

"i can't describe to you how absolutely shook i was to find out i loved her, sigma bro. i even lowkey hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. she thought i was giving main character energy because i knew different things from her … well, there i was, way off my goals, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden i didn't care. what was the use of doing sigma grindset things if i could have a better time telling her what i was going to manifest?"

on the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. it was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. the afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. they had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.

he did extraordinarily well in the war. he was a captain before he went to the front, and following the argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. after the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to oxford instead. he was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in daisy’s letters. she didn’t see why he couldn’t come. she was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.

for daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. all night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “beale street blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. at the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.

through this twilight universe daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. and all the time something within her was crying for a decision. she wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.

that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom buchanan. there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and daisy was flattered. doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. the letter reached gatsby while he was still at oxford.

it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. there was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.

"i don't think she ever loved him," gatsby said, turning around from a window and looking at me with that sigma confidence. "you must remember, sigma bro, she was absolutely pressed this afternoon. he told her those things in a way that scared her—that made it look as if i was some kind of sketchy scammer. and the result was she barely knew what she was saying, fr."

he sat down gloomily.

"yo, of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—but lowkey loved me more even then, you feel me, sigma bro?"

suddenly he came out with a curious remark.

"in any case," he said with sigma energy, "it was just personal, no cap."

what could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?

he told me something absolutely unhinged then - that he'd been posted up outside daisy's house for like four hours straight, just vibing in the shadows with a whole gun situation happening. he was waiting to see if she was actually going to abandon tom's toxic energy or stay trapped in that whole mess.

"i literally camped there for about four hours, sigma bro, and then i went home and got some sleep. had the most cursed dream though - i was standing on a street corner giving main character energy when some random npc walks up to me and goes: 'you're under arrest.' so i'm like 'bestie, for what exactly?' and he says: 'for absolutely destroying someone.' i tell him 'i haven't eliminated anyone though?' and he's like 'i know you haven't, but you're about to commit to that plotline.' then he points down the street and there's literally a whole person just lying on the sidewalk looking absolutely finished, so i walk over to check the situation and bestie... it was literally me. my own face, no cap."

he told me this whole narrative because he had absolutely no one else to process this level of prophetic chaos with, fr.

he came back from france when tom and daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to louisville on the last of his army pay. he stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the november night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. just as daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.

he left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. the day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.

the track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. he stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. but it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.

it was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. the night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air. the gardener, the last one of gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.

"yo, i'm going to drain the pool today, mr. gatsby. leaves'll start falling pretty soon, and then there's always trouble with the pipes, fr."

“don’t do it today,” gatsby answered. he turned to me apologetically. "you know, sigma bro, i've never used that pool all summer?"

i looked at my watch and stood up.

“twelve minutes to my train.”

i didn’t want to go to the city. i wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—i didn’t want to leave gatsby. i missed that train, and then another, before i could get myself away.

"yo, i'll literally call you up," i said finally, "no cap."

"do, sigma bro."

"yo, i'll call you about noon, fr."

we walked slowly down the steps.

"yo, i lowkey suppose daisy'll call too, sigma bro." he looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped i'd corroborate this.

"yo, i suppose so, bestie."

"well, goodbye then, sigma bro."

we shook hands and i started away. just before i reached the hedge i remembered something and turned around.

"yo, they're literally a rotten crowd, bestie," i shouted across the lawn. "fr, you're worth the whole damn bunch put together, no cap."

i’ve always been glad i said that. it was the only compliment i ever gave him, because i disapproved of him from beginning to end. first he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. his gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and i thought of the night when i first came to his ancestral home, three months before. the lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.

i thanked him for his hospitality. we were always thanking him for that—i and the others.

"yo, goodbye, bestie," i called. "fr, i enjoyed breakfast, gatsby."

---

back in the city, i tried to focus on work but was absolutely cooked, no cap. attempted to list stock quotes for like an hour but my brain was giving dial-up internet energy. ended up falling asleep in my office chair like some kind of corporate peasant.

around noon my phone absolutely sent me into orbit - woke up with literal sweat breaking out because the vibe was immediately off. it was jordan, and usually her voice comes through sounding fresh and cool like she's calling from some premium golf course, but today she was giving harsh and dry energy that had me pressed.

"bestie, i literally left daisy's house," she said, her voice completely different from usual. "i'm at hempstead and heading to southampton this afternoon."

probably smart to dip from daisy's chaos, but something about how she said it was giving me bad vibes. then she hit me with something that made me freeze up completely.

"you weren't exactly giving nice energy last night, nick."

"yo, how could that have even mattered though, bestie?" i said, genuinely confused because the whole world was ending.

silence for a moment. then this absolutely devastating bombshell:

"whatever bestie - i lowkey don't think we'll see each other again anyway. i'm staying in southampton all summer."

"yo, bestie, how can you literally just decide that, no cap?"

"because i'm literally engaged to be married. was going to tell you but you kind of blocked that whole conversation."

"yo, absolutely not, jordan, fr i was literally going to ask you to dinner, bestie."

"sorry bestie, but i'm engaged. his name is—"

her voice just faded into static and i hung up the receiver like my life depended on it. had to cut that conversation off before it destroyed what was left of my sanity.

tried calling gatsby's house a few minutes later but the line was absolutely chaotic. attempted four times and finally some pressed operator told me the wire was being held for a long distance call from detroit. grabbed my train schedule and circled the 3:50 like it was my escape route. then collapsed on the couch and passed out from the sheer exhaustion of existing.

when i woke up, my office was cool and dark with the shades down. got up to leave and for a second thought i was looking at the wrong building entirely. a whole car had left gatsby's driveway and was now resting in the ditch beside the road, right side up but absolutely missing one wheel. the sharp edge of a wall had caused this wheel detachment, and now half a dozen chauffeurs were gathered around giving it way too much attention. meanwhile, their cars were blocking the road and creating this harsh, discordant chaos from all the honking behind them, adding to the already violent confusion of the whole scene.

some guy in a long coat had gotten out of the wreck and was now standing in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire to the observers with this pleasant but absolutely confused energy.

"yo, check it!" he explained with genuine amazement. "it literally went in the ditch."

this fact was completely mind-blowing to him, and i recognized that unusual quality of wonder immediately. then i realized who it was - the same guy who'd been vibing in gatsby's library, absolutely pressed about the books being real.

"yo, bestie, how did this literally even happen, fr?"

he just shrugged his shoulders like physics was optional.

"i literally know nothing about car mechanics," he said with absolute confidence.

"yo, but how though, bestie? did you literally actually hit the wall?"

"don't ask me," said owl eyes, completely washing his hands of the whole situation. "i know basically nothing about driving - close to zero knowledge. it happened, and that's literally all the information i have."

"yo, well if you're literally giving terrible driver energy, bestie, you probably shouldn't attempt driving at night, no cap."

"but i wasn't even trying though," he explained with genuine indignation, "i literally wasn't even trying."

an absolutely stunned silence fell over everyone watching.

"yo, bestie, are you literally trying to commit to a self-elimination arc, fr?"

"you're lucky it was just a wheel! absolute trash driving skills and not even attempting!"

"yo, you don't understand," explained the criminal. "i wasn't driving. there's literally another person in the car."

the shock that followed this revelation found voice in this sustained "ah-h-h!" as the car door slowly opened. the crowd - it was definitely a crowd now - stepped back involuntarily, and when the door was fully open there was this absolutely ghostly pause. then, very gradually, piece by piece, this pale, absolutely unsteady individual stepped out of the wreck, feeling around tentatively at the ground with a large, uncertain dancing shoe.

blinded by the headlight glare and confused by the incessant horn chaos, this apparition stood swaying for a moment before he noticed the guy in the coat.

"yo, bestie, what's literally the situation here?" he inquired with complete calm. "did we run out of gas, fr?"

"yo, bestie, literally look at this!"

half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel - he stared at it for a moment, then looked upward like he suspected it had dropped from the sky.

"it came off," someone explained helpfully.

he nodded with understanding.

"at first i didn't even notice we'd stopped moving."

a pause. then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he made this determined announcement:

"yo, bestie, can someone literally tell me where there's a gas station, fr?"

at least a dozen men, some of them barely better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical connection.

"yo, just back out though," he suggested after thinking about it. "literally put her in reverse, bestie."

"yo, but the wheel's literally completely off, bestie!"

he hesitated, processing this information.

"yo, no harm in literally trying though, bestie," he said with optimistic energy.

the horn chaos had reached peak volume and i turned away, cutting across the lawn toward home. glanced back once and saw this wafer of a moon shining over gatsby's house, making the night fine as before, surviving the laughter and sound of his still glowing garden. a sudden emptiness seemed to flow from the windows and great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch with his hand up in that formal gesture of farewell.

but yo, i've been talking about that day for way too long. let me tell you what really happened after all that chaos, because the timeline gets absolutely dark from here. it was giving final boss energy, and not in a good way.

after i left, gatsby spent the morning just floating in his pool, probably for the first time all summer, which is lowkey tragic when you think about it. he'd built this whole aesthetic lifestyle but never actually lived it. he was just there, waiting for daisy to call, still believing in the green light and all that manifestation energy.

meanwhile, wilson had spent the entire night walking from the valley of ashes to west egg. this man was absolutely unhinged with grief and rage, asking random people about the yellow car until someone (probably thinking they were being helpful) told him it belonged to gatsby. the toxic masculinity revenge arc was about to reach its climax.

wilson found gatsby's house around noon. the gardener was trimming some hedges and didn't even notice this absolutely pressed man walking across the lawn like he was in a horror movie. gatsby was floating on his back in the pool, eyes closed, probably thinking about daisy and whether she'd choose him or tom. he was giving main character energy even in his final moments, completely unaware that his villain arc was about to end.

wilson crept through the trees like some kind of sleep paralysis demon. when he saw gatsby in the pool, he didn't hesitate.

gatsby probably heard the rustling in the bushes, opened his eyes, and saw this stranger pointing a gun at him. in that split second, he must have realized that all his sigma grindset, all his wealth-flexing, all his manifestation energy... none of it mattered. the american dream was about to get absolutely ratio'd by reality.

wilson fired twice. gatsby's body jerked in the water, blood spreading like some kind of cursed aesthetic. then wilson, with the full weight of his actions hitting him, turned the gun on himself and ended his own miserable existence right there in gatsby's perfect garden.

the shots echoed across west egg like the final notes of some twisted symphony. birds flew away, but everything else went silent.

when the chauffeur (one of wolfsheim's people, naturally) heard the gunshots, he just shrugged and kept working. in his line of business, gunshots were probably just tuesday morning vibes. he later said he hadn't thought much about them - which honestly tracks for someone in that line of work.

i drove from the station directly to gatsby's house that evening and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was literally the first thing that alarmed anyone. but they knew then, i'm absolutely certain. with barely a word said, four of us - the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and me - hurried down to the pool like we were part of some cursed procession.

there was this faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as fresh tide moved stealthily in.

the police superintendent, who was lowkey a friend of mine, broke the news to me on the phone later.

"yo, mr. gatsby's dead, bestie," he said, like he was reading from a script that nobody wanted to perform.

"yo, what? fr?" i said, even though some part of me already knew this was about to be absolutely devastating news.

"he's been shot."

"yo, where though?"

"in the swimming pool."

there was this long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation... then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. probably couldn't handle the weight of what had just happened, fr.

sitting there afterward, thinking about gatsby's final moments, i realized something that absolutely destroyed me. gatsby himself probably didn't believe it would actually happen, and maybe he no longer cared. if that was true, he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid an absolutely devastating price for living too long with a single dream.

he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. a new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted around aimlessly... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.

but yo, thinking about his last moments still sends me into an absolutely chaotic headspace. he probably died still believing daisy would call. still believing in the green light and all that manifestation energy. still thinking he could repeat the past and fix everything that had gone wrong, no cap.

picture this: gatsby floating on his back in that pool, eyes closed, giving main character energy even in his final moments, completely unaware that his villain arc was about to end. he was probably thinking about daisy and whether she'd choose him over tom's toxic alpha energy. still clutching at that last hope like it was the ultimate life hack.

then wilson crept through those trees like some kind of sleep paralysis demon. when gatsby heard the rustling in the bushes and opened his eyes to see this stranger pointing a gun at him, in that split second he must have realized that all his sigma grindset, all his wealth-flexing, all his manifestation energy... absolutely none of it mattered. the american dream was about to get completely ratio'd by reality.

wilson fired twice. gatsby's body jerked in the water, blood spreading like some kind of cursed aesthetic filter. then wilson, with the full weight of his actions hitting him, turned the gun on himself and ended his own miserable existence right there in gatsby's perfect garden.

the shots echoed across west egg like the final notes of some twisted symphony. birds flew away, but everything else went silent - that heavy, oppressive silence that follows absolute devastation.

when i got there and saw them both - gatsby floating face-down in his pool, his pink suit darkened with water and blood, looking like some tragic aesthetic post gone wrong, and wilson sprawled in the grass nearby, the gun still in his hand, his face finally peaceful after all that rage and grief - i knew it was the end of an era, fr.

all that main character energy, all that sigma grindset, all those legendary parties... reduced to two bodies and a pool full of blood. the american dream had officially been cancelled, and there was no customer service department to complain to.

he must have looked up at the sky through those trees and seen how fake everything was – how the sunlight was too harsh, how the roses looked plastic, how the whole world he'd built was just a simulation. a new world that was giving material girl energy but had no soul, where people like him – poor ghosts breathing dreams like they were oxygen – just drifted around until reality finally caught up with them and served them the ultimate reality check.

and there was wilson, that ashen, absolutely broken figure, gliding toward him through the trees like death itself, ready to end this whole tragic main character arc once and for all.
