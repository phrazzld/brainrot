iii.

there was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. the whole scene was giving major "main character hosting premium content experiences for the entire social ecosystem" energy, no cap.

the sound drifted across the bay with this intoxicating quality that made even mundane conversations feel like they were part of some exclusive social media livestream that everyone wanted to be included in. you could literally hear the clinking of champagne glasses mixed with laughter that had that specific pitch of wealthy people who never had to worry about anything genuinely stressful.

at high tide in the afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. the whole water sports situation was basically gatsby's way of flexing his recreational infrastructure on everyone within viewing distance, creating this elaborate theater of leisure that announced his wealth to the entire neighborhood.

watching these people treat his private beach like their personal playground was honestly wild - they had this casual entitlement that only comes from generational wealth or from being temporarily adopted into someone else's generational wealth experience. it was giving serious "we're all main characters in gatsby's elaborate production" vibes.

on weekends his rolls-royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. the logistics alone were absolutely sending me - this man had basically created a private transportation network just to facilitate social chaos, like some kind of wealthy person's uber system dedicated entirely to party optimization.

the whole operation was so systematic it was almost corporate - gatsby had literally industrialized the process of throwing legendary parties, turning spontaneous social gathering into a finely tuned machine for manufacturing memorable experiences and social connections.

and on mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before. the weekend was a fever dream, and monday was the hangover.

watching the cleanup process was like observing the aftermath of a small natural disaster - evidence of the previous night's chaos scattered across acres of premium real estate, requiring a small army of workers to restore gatsby's elaborate fantasy landscape to its original pristine condition, ready for the next cycle of orchestrated hedonism.

every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in new york—every monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. there was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb. a real content farm for vitamin c.

at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a christmas tree of gatsby’s enormous garden. on buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

by seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. this wasn't just background music - this was a full symphonic flex designed to soundtrack the most elaborate social performance long island had ever witnessed.

the musicians themselves were giving serious "we're being paid more for this one night than most people make in a month" energy, and they knew they were part of something legendary. the sound quality was so premium it made every conversation feel cinematic, like everyone was starring in their own personal romantic drama.

the last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from new york are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of castile.

watching the transformation from casual beach day to formal party was like witnessing a coordinated costume change on a massive scale. people emerged from their afternoon leisure activities completely reinvented, as if gatsby's house had some magical properties that could upgrade anyone's aesthetic just by being within its walls.

the fashion situation was absolutely iconic - everyone was clearly trying to out-stylish each other while pretending they'd just thrown on whatever was convenient. it was giving serious "i woke up like this but actually spent three hours getting ready" energy throughout the entire crowd.

the bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.

the alcohol was clearly premium quality and unlimited quantity, which created this atmosphere where social inhibitions just evaporated and everyone became the most charismatic version of themselves. conversations were happening at maximum intensity, like everyone was trying to pack an entire friendship into a single evening of party interaction.

the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. the groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.

suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. a momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is gilda gray’s understudy from the follies. the party has begun.

i believe that on the first night i went to gatsby's house i was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. people were not invited—they went there. they got into automobiles which bore them out to long island, and somehow they ended up at gatsby's door.

the whole guest situation was giving serious "open-access social experiment" energy where gatsby had basically created this legendary party ecosystem that operated on pure word-of-mouth and social momentum rather than any kind of traditional invitation protocol. it was like he'd accidentally invented the concept of viral social events decades before social media existed.

watching people navigate this system was honestly fascinating - you could see them trying to figure out the unspoken rules while simultaneously pretending they totally belonged there. everyone was performing confidence while secretly wondering if they were about to be exposed as party crashers.

once there they were introduced by somebody who knew gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park. the comparison to an amusement park was honestly perfect - everyone was there for the thrill and the experience, treating gatsby's entire estate like an elaborate adult playground designed for maximum entertainment and minimal responsibility.

the social dynamics were completely different from normal parties because nobody felt obligated to maintain relationships or follow conventional etiquette. it was pure hedonistic enjoyment without the usual social consequences, which created this weird liberation that probably explained why these parties had become so legendary.

sometimes they came and went without having met gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission. the fact that you could attend gatsby's party without ever encountering the host was absolutely wild - he'd created this social phenomenon that had basically transcended his own presence and taken on a life of its own.

it was like gatsby had become a myth rather than a person, and his parties were religious experiences where the deity himself remained mysteriously absent from his own temple. people were worshipping the experience he'd created rather than forming actual human connections with him.

i had been actually invited. a chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely gatsby’s, it said, if i would attend his “little party” that night. he had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed jay gatsby, in a majestic hand.

dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people i didn't know—though here and there was a face i had noticed on the commuting train. the whole experience was giving serious "side character trying to navigate main character territory" energy, and i was definitely not prepared for the social complexity of gatsby's world.

every conversation i overheard seemed to be happening in some kind of code that referenced people, places, and events that were completely outside my experience. it was like everyone else had received a briefing on how to be sophisticated and wealthy that i'd somehow missed entirely.

i was immediately struck by the number of young englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous americans. they were giving serious "international con artist" energy, clearly operating some kind of transatlantic grift that involved exploiting american wealth and naivety.

watching them work the crowd was honestly impressive from a strategic perspective - they'd identified the american tendency to be impressed by british accents and were deploying that cultural advantage with ruthless efficiency. every conversation was basically a masterclass in psychological manipulation disguised as polite small talk.

i was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. they were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key. the whole scene was like watching a nature documentary about financial predators in their natural habitat, except the habitat was gatsby's garden and the prey were wealthy americans who thought they were just having casual party conversations.

the way they circulated through the crowd was so systematic it was almost military - each one had clearly identified their target demographics and was working specific sections of the party like they were farming social connections for maximum profit yield.

as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

the sight of jordan was honestly a relief that was probably way too obvious on my face - finally, someone i actually knew in this sea of sophisticated strangers who all seemed to be operating on social frequencies i couldn't access. she was giving her signature "effortlessly superior to everyone" energy, surveying the party like a queen reviewing her subjects.

watching her scan the crowd was like observing a professional athlete assess the competition - she had this calculating way of cataloging everyone's social status, fashion choices, and potential usefulness with just a casual glance. it was honestly intimidating but also kind of impressive.

"yo, hello!" i roared across the garden, advancing toward her with this probably way-too-enthusiastic energy. my voice seemed unnaturally loud and incredibly cringe compared to the sophisticated party atmosphere, like i was announcing myself as the awkward person who didn't belong here.

the contrast between my desperate social flailing and jordan's effortless confidence was honestly painful to experience. she was the kind of person who could make small talk feel like a strategic advantage, while i was clearly struggling with basic party navigation and probably broadcasting my discomfort to everyone within a fifty-foot radius.

"thought you might show up," she responded with this totally absent-minded tone as i approached, like my presence was predictable but not particularly interesting. "i remembered you lived next door to—" she let the sentence hang there with this effortless superiority that suggested finishing thoughts was beneath her, fr.

she held my hand impersonally, like a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and turned her attention to two girls in twin yellow dresses who had stopped at the foot of the marble steps, clearly hoping to get some of jordan's elite golf champion energy.

"yo, hello there!" they cried together with this synchronized enthusiasm. "sorry you didn't win the tournament, bestie!"

that was referring to the golf tournament where she'd lost in the finals the week before, which was probably the first time jordan baker had lost anything in her entire life.

"you probably don't know who we are," said one of the girls in yellow with this hopeful energy, "but fr, we actually met you here about a month ago at gatsby's last party."

"mm, you've dyed your hair since then," remarked jordan with this cutting observation that was delivered so casually it felt like a surgical strike. i started a little at the sharpness of it, but the girls had already moved on with this casual acceptance, and her remark seemed to be addressed more to the premature moon hanging over the garden than to any actual person.

the whole interaction was giving jordan's signature "effortless cruelty disguised as mild interest" energy.

with jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine—and she made even this casual gesture feel like she was doing me an enormous favor—we descended the steps and sauntered through gatsby's elaborate garden setup with this slow, deliberate pace that announced we were too cool to be impressed by any of this obvious wealth display.

the physical contact was clearly jordan's way of claiming social territory and announcing to everyone else that i was under her protection, which honestly saved me from having to figure out how to navigate this social minefield on my own. being jordan baker's temporary accessory was infinitely better than being a lost lone wolf at gatsby's party.

walking through the garden with jordan felt like having a personal guide to the social ecosystem - she knew exactly which groups to acknowledge with a nod, which people to completely ignore, and how to position ourselves to observe maximum party drama while maintaining our superior detachment.

a tray of cocktails literally floated toward us through the twilight, carried by one of gatsby's army of servants, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three interchangeable men who were each introduced to us as some variation of "mr. mumble"—because apparently remembering names was not a priority at these parties.

the whole seating arrangement was clearly strategic on jordan's part - she'd selected a table that gave us optimal viewing angles for people-watching while positioning herself as the obvious queen of our little social cluster. the girls in yellow were clearly hoping some of jordan's golf champion prestige would rub off on them.

watching jordan operate in this environment was like observing a master class in social dominance - she could make other people feel honored just by tolerating their presence, and everyone at the table was clearly performing extra hard to maintain her attention and approval.

"bestie, do you come to these parties often?" inquired jordan of the girl beside her, with this tone that managed to sound both genuinely curious and slightly judgmental at the same time.

the question was obviously designed to establish social hierarchy - jordan was subtly finding out whether these girls were gatsby party regulars or newcomers, which would determine exactly how much attention they deserved and what level of conversational effort she needed to invest.

"the last party was literally the one where i met you," answered the girl with this alert, confident voice that suggested she was trying to establish some kind of social connection. she turned to her companion for confirmation: "wasn't it the same for you, lucille? fr?"

the way she immediately referenced their previous meeting was giving serious "please remember me and acknowledge that we have a connection" energy. you could tell she was hoping to elevate her status by reminding jordan of their shared party history, even though it was obviously a brief and forgettable encounter.

it was for lucille, too, obviously. the synchronized response suggested these girls had definitely coordinated their approach to socializing with jordan, probably spending time before the party strategizing about how to make the best impression on the famous golf champion.

watching this whole interaction was like observing a nature documentary about social hierarchies in their natural habitat - jordan was clearly the apex predator, and everyone else was trying to figure out how to position themselves for maximum benefit without triggering her contempt.

the girls were putting in serious effort to seem interesting and worthy of jordan's attention, while jordan was evaluating whether they were worth the energy of sustained conversation or if she should start looking around for more entertaining social opportunities.

it was honestly exhausting to witness this level of social calculation disguised as casual party conversation, but also fascinating to see how naturally jordan dominated these interactions without appearing to try at all.

"honestly, i love coming to these things," lucille said with this enthusiasm that was giving main character energy. "i literally never care what i do when i'm here, so i always have the most incredible time, no cap. when i was here last month, i tore my gown on one of these fancy chairs, and gatsby literally asked me my name and address right there on the spot—and get this, inside of a week i got this package from croirier's with a brand new evening gown in it, fr."

"wait, did you actually keep it?" asked jordan with this slight raise of her eyebrow that suggested the question had multiple layers of judgment embedded in it.

jordan's tone was giving serious "testing your moral character while pretending to make casual conversation" energy. she was clearly evaluating whether lucille had the social awareness to understand the complex etiquette around accepting expensive gifts from mysterious party hosts, or if she was the type of person who would just take advantage of gatsby's legendary generosity.

the whole gift situation was honestly a perfect example of how gatsby's parties operated in this weird moral gray area where normal social rules didn't apply, but there were still unspoken standards that separated the sophisticated guests from the obvious social climbers.

you could see lucille processing the question and trying to figure out what answer would make her seem more impressive to jordan - whether keeping the dress showed she was worthy of gatsby's attention, or whether returning it would prove she had integrity and wasn't just there for the free stuff.

the pause before her response was giving major "realizing i might have failed a social test i didn't know i was taking" energy, which was honestly painful to witness but also provided excellent insight into the psychological warfare that passed for normal conversation in jordan's social circle.

"absolutely i kept it," lucille replied with zero shame. "i was literally going to wear it tonight, but it turned out to be too big in the bust area and had to get it altered. it was this gorgeous gas blue color with lavender beads all over it. the price tag said two hundred and sixty-five dollars, no cap."

"there's something genuinely weird about a guy who'll just do something like that," said the other girl with this eager, gossipy energy. "like, he obviously doesn't want any drama or trouble with literally anybody. it's giving people-pleaser but make it rich."

the observation was actually pretty insightful - gatsby's legendary generosity was starting to look less like casual wealth-flexing and more like a carefully calculated strategy to maintain his mysterious reputation while avoiding any social conflicts that might damage his elaborate party ecosystem.

it was honestly kind of tragic when you thought about it - here was someone with unlimited resources using his wealth to buy social immunity rather than genuine connections, creating this elaborate performance of friendship and generosity that kept everyone entertained but ultimately isolated him from authentic human relationships.

the whole dynamic was giving serious "main character energy trapped in supporting character relationships" vibes - gatsby had all the power and resources but was somehow still dependent on other people's approval and acceptance in the most heartbreaking way possible.

"wait, who doesn't want trouble?" i inquired, because obviously i was missing some crucial context here.

"gatsby, duh," the girl said like it was obvious. "somebody literally told me—" but then she stopped mid-sentence and looked around dramatically.

the two girls in yellow and jordan immediately leaned together in this conspiratorial huddle like they were about to share the most classified government secrets.

"okay so somebody told me," the first girl whispered with this thrilled energy, "that they genuinely think he killed a man once. like, actually murdered someone."

this absolutely unhinged piece of gossip sent a thrill through our entire table. even the three interchangeable mr. mumbles suddenly bent forward and started listening with this eager, bloodthirsty attention like they were hoping for graphic details.

"honestly, i don't think it's that dramatic," argued lucille with this skeptical tone, like she was the voice of reason in this conspiracy theory discussion. "what i heard is that he was actually a german spy during the war. like, full double-agent situation."

one of the mr. mumble guys immediately nodded in confirmation with this know-it-all energy.

"yo, i literally heard that exact same thing from this guy who knew all about gatsby's whole background," he assured us with complete confidence. "apparently they grew up together in germany before gatsby moved to america. it's all connected."

"no way, that can't be right though," said the first girl, clearly not wanting to let go of her murder theory. "because i know for a fact that he was in the american army during the war." as our attention and credulity switched back to her, she leaned forward with this building enthusiasm. "but like, you should see the way he looks sometimes when he thinks nobody's watching him. i'm telling you, that man has definitely killed someone. you can see it in his eyes."

she narrowed her eyes with this dramatic flair and gave this theatrical little shiver. lucille immediately copied the shiver because apparently we were all just performing our reactions now. we all turned and started scanning the party crowd for gatsby himself, like we were trying to spot a celebrity or a wanted criminal.

it was honestly incredible testimony to the absolutely unhinged romantic speculation gatsby inspired that there were literally whispers and conspiracy theories about him from people who had found basically nothing else in their privileged lives that was even worth whispering about.

the first supper of the evening—because apparently there would be another full meal situation after midnight because rich people are absolutely unhinged—was now being served by gatsby's army of catering staff, and jordan decided to invite me to join her own social group, who were spread around this more exclusive table on the other side of the garden.

this crew consisted of three married couples who were giving peak "we're better than everyone here" energy, plus jordan's current escort situation—this persistent undergraduate who kept making increasingly violent innuendo comments and was obviously operating under the completely delusional impression that sooner or later jordan was going to yield him up her person to some greater or lesser degree, which anyone with eyes could tell was absolutely never going to happen.

instead of the chaotic party rambling that was happening everywhere else, this particular group had preserved this dignified homogeneity that was basically their whole brand, and they'd assumed this role of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—basically east egg literally condescending to west egg and staying carefully on guard against gatsby's spectroscopic gaiety like it might be contagious.

"let's literally get out of here," whispered jordan after what felt like a somehow wasteful and completely inappropriate half-hour of pretentious small talk. "this whole vibe is way too polite and boring for me. it's giving retirement home energy."

we got up with this synchronized movement, and she explained that we were going to find the actual host since i had never met him and, according to her, this was making me seem "pressed and awkward." the undergraduate nodded in this cynical, melancholy way that suggested he knew jordan was never coming back to this conversation.

the bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but gatsby was not there. she couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. on a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high gothic library, paneled with carved english oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.

a stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. as we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined jordan from head to foot.

“what do you think?” he demanded impetuously.

“about what?”

he waved his hand toward the bookshelves.

“about that. as a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. i ascertained. they’re real.”

“the books?”

he nodded.

“absolutely real—have pages and everything. i thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. pages and—here! lemme show you.”

taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the stoddard lectures.

“see!” he cried triumphantly. “it’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. it fooled me. this fella’s a regular belasco. it’s a triumph. what thoroughness! what realism! knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. but what do you want? what do you expect?”

he snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.

“who brought you?” he demanded. “or did you just come? i was brought. most people were brought.”

jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.

“i was brought by a woman named roosevelt,” he continued. “mrs. claud roosevelt. do you know her? i met her somewhere last night. i’ve been drunk for about a week now, and i thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”

“has it?”

“a little bit, i think. i can’t tell yet. i’ve only been here an hour. did i tell you about the books? they’re real. they’re—”

“you told us.”

we shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.

there was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. by midnight the hilarity had increased. a celebrated tenor had sung in italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. a pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. the moon had risen higher, and floating in the sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

i was still with jordan baker. we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. i was enjoying myself now. i had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.

at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

“your face is familiar,” he said politely. “weren’t you in the first division during the war?”

“why yes. i was in the twenty-eighth infantry.”

“i was in the sixteenth until june nineteen-eighteen. i knew i’d seen you somewhere before.”

we talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in france. evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.

"want to go with me, sigma bro? just near the shore along the sound."

“what time?”

“any time that suits you best.”

it was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when jordan looked around and smiled.

“having a gay time now?” she inquired.

“much better.” i turned again to my new acquaintance. “this is an unusual party for me. i haven’t even seen the host. i live over there—” i waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”

for a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.

“i’m gatsby,” he said suddenly.

“what!” i exclaimed. “oh, i beg your pardon.”

"i thought you knew, sigma bro. i'm afraid i'm not a very good host."

he smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. it faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. it understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. precisely at that point it vanished—and i was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. some time before he introduced himself i’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.

almost at the moment when mr. gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that chicago was calling him on the wire. he excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.

"if you want anything just ask for it, sigma bro," he urged me. "excuse me. i will rejoin you later."

when he was gone i turned immediately to jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. i had expected that mr. gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.

“who is he?” i demanded. “do you know?”

“he’s just a man named gatsby.”

“where is he from, i mean? and what does he do?”

“now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “well, he told me once he was an oxford man.”

a dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.

“however, i don’t believe it.”

“why not?”

“i don’t know,” she insisted, “i just don’t think he went there.”

something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “i think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. i would have accepted without question the information that gatsby sprang from the swamps of louisiana or from the lower east side of new york. that was comprehensible. but young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience i believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on long island sound.

“anyhow, he gives large parties,” said jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “and i like large parties. they’re so intimate. at small parties there isn’t any privacy.”

there was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.

“ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “at the request of mr. gatsby we are going to play for you mr. vladmir tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at carnegie hall last may. if you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” he smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “some sensation!” whereupon everybody laughed.

“the piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘vladmir tostoff’s jazz history of the world!’”

the nature of mr. tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. his tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. i could see nothing sinister about him. i wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. when the “jazz history of the world” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on gatsby, and no french bob touched gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with gatsby’s head for one link.

“i beg your pardon.”

gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.

“miss baker?” he inquired. “i beg your pardon, but mr. gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”

“with me?” she exclaimed in surprise.

“yes, madame.”

she got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. i noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

i was alone and it was almost two. for some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. eluding jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, i went inside.

the large room was full of people. one of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. she had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. the tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. a humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.

“she had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.

i looked around. most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. even jordan’s party, the quartet from east egg, were rent asunder by dissension. one of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “you promised!” into his ear.

the reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. the hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. the wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.

“whenever he sees i’m having a good time he wants to go home.”

“never heard anything so selfish in my life.”

“we’re always the first ones to leave.”

“so are we.”

“well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “the orchestra left half an hour ago.”

in spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.

as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and jordan baker and gatsby came out together. he was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

“i’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “how long were we in there?”

“why, about an hour.”

“it was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “but i swore i wouldn’t tell it and here i am tantalizing you.” she yawned gracefully in my face. “please come and see me … phone book … under the name of mrs. sigourney howard … my aunt …” she was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.

rather ashamed that on my first appearance i had stayed so late, i joined the last of gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. i wanted to explain that i’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.

"don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "don't give it another thought, sigma bro." the familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. "and don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock."

then the butler, behind his shoulder:

“philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”

“all right, in a minute. tell them i’ll be right there … good night.”

“good night.”

"good night." he smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. "good night, sigma bro … good night."

but as i walked down the steps i saw that the evening was not quite over. fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. in the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. the sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. however, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.

a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

“see!” he explained. “it went in the ditch.”

the fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and i recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of gatsby’s library.

“how’d it happen?”

he shrugged his shoulders.

“i know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.

“but how did it happen? did you run into the wall?”

“don’t ask me,” said owl eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “i know very little about driving—next to nothing. it happened, and that’s all i know.”

“well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”

“but i wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “i wasn’t even trying.”

an awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

“do you want to commit suicide?”

“you’re lucky it was just a wheel! a bad driver and not even trying!”

“you don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “i wasn’t driving. there’s another man in the car.”

the shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. the crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.

“wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “did we run outa gas?”

“look!”

half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.

“it came off,” someone explained.

he nodded.

“at first i din’ notice we’d stopped.”

a pause. then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:

“wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”

at least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.

“back out,” he suggested after a moment. “put her in reverse.”

“but the wheel’s off!”

he hesitated.

“no harm in trying,” he said.

the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and i turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. i glanced back once. a wafer of a moon was shining over gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.

reading over what i have written so far, i see i have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. on the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.

most of the time i worked. in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust. i knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away.

i took dinner usually at the yale club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. there were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. after that, if the night was mellow, i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel, and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station.

i began to like new york, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. sometimes, in my mind, i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, i felt a sinking in my heart. forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. imagining that i, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, i wished them well.

for a while i lost sight of jordan baker, and then in midsummer i found her again. at first i was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. then it was something more. i wasn’t actually in love, but i felt a sort of tender curiosity. the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day i found what it was. when we were on a house-party together up in warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisy’s. at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. the thing approached a scandal, and then died away. a caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. the incident and the name had been coupled together in my mind.

it was a strange coincidence that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.

i lived at west egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some hôtel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.

across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i’d known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.

her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anticlimax. his family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.

why they came east i don’t know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn’t believe it—i had no sight into daisy’s heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.

and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.

his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.

“now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because i’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

“i’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.

turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.

“it belonged to demaine, the oil man.” he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “we’ll go inside.”

we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.

the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.

“i’m p-paralysed with happiness.”

she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i’ve heard it said that daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)

at any rate, miss baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

“do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.

“the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”

“how gorgeous! let’s go back, tom. tomorrow!” then she added irrelevantly: “you ought to see the baby.”

“i’d like to.”

“she’s asleep. she’s three years old. haven’t you ever seen her?”

“never.”

“well, you ought to see her. she’s—”

tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.

“what you doing, nick?”

“i’m a bond man.”

“who with?”

i told him.

“never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.

this annoyed me.

“you will,” i answered shortly. “you will if you stay in the east.”

“oh, i’ll stay in the east, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “i’d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.”

at this point miss baker said: “absolutely!” with such suddenness that i started—it was the first word she had uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

“i’m stiff,” she complained, “i’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.”

“don’t look at me,” daisy retorted, “i’ve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.”

“no, thanks,” said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “i’m absolutely in training.”

her host looked at her incredulously.

“you are!” he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “how you ever get anything done is beyond me.”

i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

“you live in west egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “i know somebody there.”

“i don’t know a single—”

“you must know gatsby.”

“gatsby?” demanded daisy. “what gatsby?”

before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.

“why candles?” objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. “in two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” she looked at us all radiantly. “do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”

“we ought to plan something,” yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.

“all right,” said daisy. “what’ll we plan?” she turned to me helplessly: “what do people plan?”

before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.

“look!” she complained; “i hurt it.”

we all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.

“you did it, tom,” she said accusingly. “i know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. that’s what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”

“i hate that word ‘hulking,’” objected tom crossly, “even in kidding.”

“hulking,” insisted daisy.

sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.

“you make me feel uncivilized, daisy,” i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “can’t you talk about crops or something?”

i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.

“civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out tom violently. “i’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read the rise of the colored empires by this man goddard?”

“why, no,” i answered, rather surprised by his tone.

“well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. it’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”

“tom’s getting very profound,” said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “he reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we—”

“well, these books are all scientific,” insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. “this fellow has worked out the whole thing. it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”

“we’ve got to beat them down,” whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.

“you ought to live in california—” began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.

“this idea is that we’re nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and—” after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?”

there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.

“i’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “it’s about the butler’s nose. do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”

“that’s why i came over tonight.”

“well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”

“things went from bad to worse,” suggested miss baker.

“yes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”

for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.

the butler came back and murmured something close to tom’s ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.

“i love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn’t he?” she turned to miss baker for confirmation: “an absolute rose?”

this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.

miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “sh!” in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.

“this mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—” i began.

“don’t talk. i want to hear what happens.”

“is something happening?” i inquired innocently.

“you mean to say you don’t know?” said miss baker, honestly surprised. “i thought everybody knew.”

“i don’t.”

“why—” she said hesitantly. “tom’s got some woman in new york.”

“got some woman?” i repeated blankly.

miss baker nodded.

“she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don’t you think?”

almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.

“it couldn’t be helped!” cried daisy with tense gaiety.

she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: “i looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. there’s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he’s singing away—” her voice sang: “it’s romantic, isn’t it, tom?”

“very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “if it’s light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.”

the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn’t guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.

the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.

“we don’t know each other very well, nick,” she said suddenly. “even if we are cousins. you didn’t come to my wedding.”

“i wasn’t back from the war.”

“that’s true.” she hesitated. “well, i’ve had a very bad time, nick, and i’m pretty cynical about everything.”

evidently she had reason to be. i waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.

“i suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”

“oh, yes.” she looked at me absently. “listen, nick; let me tell you what i said when she was born. would you like to hear?”

“very much.”

“it’ll show you how i’ve gotten to feel about—things. well, she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where. i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. she told me it was a girl, and so i turned my head away and wept. ‘all right,’ i said, ‘i’m glad it’s a girl. and i hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’

“you see i think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. and i know. i’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “sophisticated—god, i’m sophisticated!”

the instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. it made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. i waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged.

inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. the lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

“to be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”

her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.

“ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “time for this good girl to go to bed.”

“jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained daisy, “over at westchester.”

“oh—you’re jordan baker.”

i knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach. i had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was i had forgotten long ago.

“good night,” she said softly. “wake me at eight, won’t you.”

“if you’ll get up.”

“i will. good night, mr. carraway. see you anon.”

“of course you will,” confirmed daisy. “in fact i think i’ll arrange a marriage. come over often, nick, and i’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. you know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”

“good night,” called miss baker from the stairs. “i haven’t heard a word.”

“she’s a nice girl,” said tom after a moment. “they oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”

“who oughtn’t to?” inquired daisy coldly.

“her family.”

“her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. besides, nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, nick? she’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. i think the home influence will be very good for her.”

daisy and tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.

“is she from new york?” i asked quickly.

“from louisville. our white girlhood was passed together there. our beautiful white—”

“did you give nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded tom suddenly.

“did i?” she looked at me. “i can’t seem to remember, but i think we talked about the nordic race. yes, i’m sure we did. it sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”

“don’t believe everything you hear, nick,” he advised me.

i said lightly that i had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later i got up to go home. they came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. as i started my motor daisy peremptorily called: “wait!

“i forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. we heard you were engaged to a girl out west.”

“that’s right,” corroborated tom kindly. “we heard that you were engaged.”

“it’s a libel. i’m too poor.”

“but we heard it,” insisted daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “we heard it from three people, so it must be true.”

of course i knew what they were referring to, but i wasn’t even vaguely engaged. the fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons i had come east. you can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors, and on the other hand i had no intention of being rumored into marriage.

their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, i was confused and a little disgusted as i drove away. it seemed to me that the thing for daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. as for tom, the fact that he “had some woman in new york” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when i reached my estate at west egg i ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. the wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. the silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, i saw that i was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was mr. gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.

i decided to call to him. miss baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. but i didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as i was from him, i could have sworn he was trembling. involuntarily i glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. when i looked once more for gatsby he had vanished, and i was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

reading over what i have written so far, i see i have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. on the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.

most of the time i worked. in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust. i knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away.

i took dinner usually at the yale club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. there were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. after that, if the night was mellow, i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel, and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station.

i began to like new york, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. sometimes, in my mind, i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, i felt a sinking in my heart. forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. imagining that i, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, i wished them well.

for a while i lost sight of jordan baker, and then in midsummer i found her again. at first i was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. then it was something more. i wasn’t actually in love, but i felt a sort of tender curiosity. the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day i found what it was. when we were on a house-party together up in warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisy’s. at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. the thing approached a scandal, and then died away. a caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. the incident and the name had been coupled together in my mind.

jordan baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code of behavior is felt instinctively, not detected by a critical intelligence. she was incurably dishonest. she wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.

it made no difference to me. dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—i was casually sorry, and then i forgot. it was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.

“you’re a rotten driver,” i protested. “either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”

“i am careful.”

“no, you’re not.”

“well, other people are,” she said lightly.

“what’s that got to do with it?”

“they’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “it takes two to make an accident.”

“suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”

“i hope i never will,” she answered. “i hate careless people. that’s why i liked you.”

her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment i thought i loved her. but i am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and i knew that first i had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. i’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “love, nick,” and all i could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before i was free.

everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: i am one of the few honest people that i have ever known.
