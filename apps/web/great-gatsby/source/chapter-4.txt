On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,
the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled
hilariously on his lawn.

“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between
his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found
out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the
devil.”

Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there
crystal glass.

Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of
those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable
now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect
July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will
give you a better impression of the scene than my generalities can
ever do.

From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a
man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who
was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie
Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a
corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.
And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.
Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned
cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.

Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,
in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the
garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R.
P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the
Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he
went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs.
Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came,
too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A.
Fland, and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.
Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry
L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train
in Times Square.

Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never the
same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with
another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have
forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria
or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names
of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American
capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves
to be.

In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came
there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had
his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,
his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of
the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be
her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose
name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.

All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.

At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched
up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its
three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I
had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his
urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.

“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I
thought we’d ride up together.”

He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness
of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with
knowing that types of starting up just as you are going to fall into
a heap, will be welcome wherever you go. His acquaintances resented
the fact that he turned up in popular cafés with her and, leaving her
at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.

His station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all
trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener,
toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and
garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.

I hadn’t seen him around, and I was glad I’d guarded my tongue and
hadn’t asked any questions.

“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his
hands in his coat sleeves as we rattled through West Egg village—a
request which I found to be connected with the invisible hedge in the
distance, and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an
invitation.”

For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “row” based on the
fact that we were neighbours, but he only continued his story.

“It was a great relief when the war came. I tried to die, but I seemed
to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant
when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments
so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us
where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two
nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the
infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German
divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and
every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little
Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”

Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his
smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and
sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It
appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited
this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was
submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a
dozen magazines.

He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell
into my palm.

“That’s the one from Montenegro.”

To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi de Danilo,”
ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”

“Turn it over.”

“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”

“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It
was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of
Doncaster.”

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an
archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,
looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.

Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace
on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with
their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawing of his broken heart.

“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his
souvenir in a careful hand. “That’s why I had to tell you about my
life. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I
usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there
trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated.
“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”

“At lunch?”

“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking tea
with Miss Baker.”

“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”

“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak
to you about this matter.”

I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more
annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to
discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something
utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon
his overpopulated lawn.

He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared
the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted
ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark
shops of neighbourhood grocery stores. The sun caught the tops of the
high buildings, and seemed to fill the whole sky with flying metal,
and to keep only an enchanted metropolitan twilight for the pavements
below.

“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;
“anything at all.…”

Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby
for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes
picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.

“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.”

A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two
fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a
moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.

“—so I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand
earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”

“What?” I inquired politely.

But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and
covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.

“I handed him the money,” he said. “I handed him the money and I said:
‘Here’s the money, old sport, and you can have more if you want it, but
don’t you ever come near me again.’ I gave him the money on condition
that he’d have nothing more to do with me.”

Gatsby smiled.

“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is
one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a
denizen of Broadway.”

“He’s a gambler,” Gatsby explained, and continued his story. “He’s the
man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”

“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.

The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s
Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I
would have thought of it as something that merely happened, the end of
some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start
to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness
of a burglar blowing a safe.

“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.

“He just saw the opportunity.”

“Why isn’t he in jail?”

“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”

I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught
sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.

“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to
someone.”

When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.

“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy��s furious because you
haven’t called up.”

“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”

They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment
came over Gatsby’s face.

“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to
come up this far?”

“I’m having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”

I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.

One October day in nineteen-seventeen—

(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight
chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)

—I was walking along from one place to another half an hour before
curfew, and I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was dressed
in my usual sports clothes.

There was a big dance at the Armory, and I was on my way to get my hair
bobbed. When I came opposite the Red Cross rooms, I saw a girl sitting
on the porch of her house, and she was dressed in white, and had a little
white roadster beside her. When I came nearer I saw that her name was
Daisy Fay, and that she was the most popular of all the young girls in
Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and
all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers
from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night.
“Anyways, for an hour!”

When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside
the curb, and she was sitting on the porch with a lieutenant I had never
seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see
me until I was five feet away.

“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older
girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross
and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t
come that day? The officer looked at me with a polite smile.

“I’m going to a dance,” she said, “with this gentleman. His name is Jay
Gatsby, and he’s a lieutenant in the army. He’s just come from Camp
Taylor.”

He got up and shook my hand, and I was flattered that he knew my name.

“What was that?” I inquired.

“Her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New
York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was afraid
for her reputation, so she prevented her from going.”

It was a strange coincidence, but it doesn’t matter. The officer was
Gatsby.

“Anyhow, he is from Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together
there. Our beautiful white—”

“Did you say from Louisville?” I demanded.

“Yes.”

“Well, I’m from Louisville myself. I know his family. He’s a cousin of
somebody of the name of—”

“His name is Jay Gatsby, and I don’t know where he’s from. I think he’s
a relative of the man who owns the newspaper—the Louisville Courier-Journal.”

“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between
his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found
out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the
devil.”

I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never
seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute
she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the
most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She’d
sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers
over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was
touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated
way.

That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a
wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his
car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm
was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.

The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a
year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then
they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,
as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich
and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps
because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among
hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can
time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so
blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour
at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers.…

Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time
in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby
in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me
up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she
said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.
It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in
her white car.

When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, she started to cry.”
She thought you might be offended. You see, she���s a little shy, and the
first time she saw you she was just going to leave when you came in. But
she’s got an idea in her head, and she wants to see you about it. She
wants you to ask Gatsby to your house some afternoon and then let her
come over.

The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought
a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could
“come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.

“Did you see the way he looked at me?” she said. “He’s so hard to talk
to.”

“He is,” I agreed. “He has a lot of things on his mind.”

“He wants to know,” she continued, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your house
some afternoon and then let him come over.”

“You mean he wants to have her see his house?”

“He wants to have her see his house,” she explained. “And your house is
right next door.”

“Oh!”

“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some
night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people
discreetly if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was
that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the
elaborate story he told me about his life—he grew up in the country and
he was educated at Oxford, because all his ancestor had been educated
there for many years. For a moment I thought he was pulling my leg, but
he wasn’t. He was delivering an impassioned lecture on his life and
fortunes, and I was the only one in the room.

“Oh!”

We talked like that for a while, and then she called up the room clerk
and asked for a timetable. She knew what she was doing. I could have
sworn she was trembling. Her hand, though, was steady as she took a
pencil and drew a circle around the three-o’clock train.

“I’m to call him up, you see, and arrange a meeting.”

“Oh, that’s all?”

“That’s all, old sport,” he said bravely. “Don’t be worried. I’m not going
to ask you to do anything out of the way.”

“I’m just going to ask you to invite her to tea.”

We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth
Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.
Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face
floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up
the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled,
and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.
