# Translation System Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Brainrot Publishing House translation methodology and project specifications.

## üìö Directory Structure

### `/methodology`

Core translation methodology and guidelines

- **[guidelines.md](methodology/guidelines.md)** - Complete 974-line translation methodology for maximalist gremlin mode
- **quality-metrics.md** - Success criteria and validation frameworks
- **brainrot-glossary.md** - Comprehensive vocabulary reference (850+ terms)

### `/projects`

Project-specific documentation for each translation

- **[/great-gatsby](projects/great-gatsby/)** - The Great Gatsby translation project
  - [specification.md](projects/great-gatsby/specification.md) - Task requirements and implementation strategy
  - [character-voices.md](projects/great-gatsby/character-voices.md) - Character-specific brainrot voice mappings
  - [completion-report.md](projects/great-gatsby/completion-report.md) - Project completion metrics and analysis

### `/reference`

Quick reference materials and matrices

- **slur-matrix.md** - Cultural sensitivity protocols and replacement strategies
- **expansion-patterns.md** - Density optimization techniques for achieving 3-5+ terms per sentence

## üéØ Translation Philosophy

Our translations follow the "maximalist gremlin mode" approach:

- **100% Literary Fidelity**: Preserve all plot points, characters, and themes
- **100% Brainrot Density**: Every sentence must be unavoidably brainrotted
- **Cultural Bridge**: Modern meme references replace period-specific details
- **Character Consistency**: Unique brainrot voice patterns for each character

## üìä Success Metrics

A successful translation must achieve:

- Complete source coverage with no omissions
- 3-5+ brainrot terms per sentence minimum
- Character voice consistency throughout
- Appropriate cultural sensitivity handling
- Length parity with source material (¬±15%)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Review the [translation guidelines](methodology/guidelines.md)
2. Study project-specific requirements in the relevant `/projects` folder
3. Reference character voice mappings for consistency
4. Use the quality metrics framework for validation

## üìù Contributing

When adding new translations:

1. Create a new project folder under `/projects`
2. Include specification, character voices, and completion report
3. Follow the established methodology from `/methodology`
4. Update this README with the new project
