hector the shining goat says “aight bet,” busts out the gates lookin fierce as fuck,
paris (aka alexandros, the dude who started all this drama) slides in right next to him,
both of ‘em vibin with that war-lust, hearts pumping like “let’s get it, no cap.”

just like when the gods throw a tired group of sailors a sweet sea-breeze—
they’ve been rowing and cussing out the waves for ages, arms on fire,
then suddenly the wind hits different and they’re saved—
that’s how these two rolled up to the trojans, who’d been praying for a w.

first kill: menesthios, son of areïthoos the mace-wielder, goes down:
hector jabs him quick under that shiny bronze helmet, man’s done.
paris’s sidekick glaukos from lycia spears ifinoos off his chariot,
straight through the shoulder—poor dude topples, limbs turned to jelly.

athena, the grey-eyed sis, sees the argives slaying trojans left and right
and goes “ugh, i gotta break this up,” zooms down from mount olympus.
apollo, scoping it from pergamos, is like “hey, i want the trojans to bag this dub,”
so he meets athena at this big oak near the battlefield,
and he's like, “yo daughter of zeus, why you out here messing with the trojans again?
maybe let’s calm all this down for a hot sec.
look, the trojans are dying out here, but you’re not shedding a single tear for them, huh?
but how bout we do a quick ceasefire so they can bury the bodies,
then y’all can throw hands again tomorrow? your call, sis.”

athena’s like, “lowkey, same idea. i was heading down anyway.
let’s stir up hector’s savage vibes, see if he’ll call out the best of the achaeans,
1v1 me, bro. if their bronze-greaved squad’s got the guts, they can send a champion.”
apollo’s nodding: “bet.” and helenos, hector’s seer-bro, catches the plan telepathically,
so he sidles up to hector and says, “hey man, i got the inside track from the gods:
tell the trojans to park it, call for a single achaean to fight you, big dog.
spoiler alert: it’s not your time to die yet, i heard that from up high.”

hector’s eyes light up, he’s like “say less,” steps up front,
holds his spear across so the trojan ranks stand still,
agamemnon sees that and calls the achaean lines to stand down too.
then the gods themselves perch on an oak, disguised like giant birds,
just casually spectating, both squads lined up, shields shining like a stormy sea.

hector’s all: “listen up trojans and achaeans in them fly greaves,
zeus is out here playing 4d chess with both armies,
someone’s about to take troy or else the trojans push you back to your ships.
but in the meantime, if any of you achaean goats wants smoke with me, speak up.
let’s 1v1. i swear if he kills me, he can keep my gear,
just send my body back to my folks for a proper funeral,
but if i clap him and apollo blesses me with the w,
i’ll keep his armor, hang it in apollo’s temple,
and send the body back so his boys can do their funeral rites.
that way, someday folks sailing these seas can point at his tomb and say,
‘that’s the dude hector murked when he was top dog in this war.’
that’s how my name stays, no cap.”

he drops that mic, and everyone’s quiet.
they’re either shook to decline or lowkey too scared to step up.
finally menelaos, big brother to the king, stands up pissed,
“are you for real, achaeans? you’re letting hector punk us like this?
fine, i’ll do it, i guess y’all turned into chickens overnight.”
he suits up, but we all know hector would probably eat menelaos for brunch,
so agamemnon (king vibes) grabs his bro’s wrist: “dude, chill.
hector is outta your league, even achilles was wary to square up with him.
let’s pick someone else from the goat squad.”

this old boss nestor steps in, reading them the riot act:
“dang, it’s tragic how old pêleus (achilles’ father) would cry if he saw us now.
back in my day, i took on monsters like ereuthalion solo and won,
and i was the youngest in my crew. i wish i had that youthful glow right now.
i’d run it back with hector so quick. but i’m old, your turn.”

so nine dudes step forward, hungry to battle: agamemnon, diomedes, the two ajaxes, idomeneus, meriones, eurypylos, thoas, and the cunning odysseus.
nestor’s like, “aight, let’s toss lots. whoever gets the short straw fights hector.”

they do the lottery, folks praying to big daddy zeus that either ajax or diomedes or big king ag’s name will come up.
the herald stirs the tokens in agamemnon’s shiny helmet,
out jumps the token of telamonian ajax—big man from salamis,
everyone is hype. he sees the mark and he’s all, “yo, that’s me.”

he’s like, “fam, i’m stoked to throw hands with hector.
but first, pray in silence or out loud, i don’t care, just hype me up to zeus.
i’m not scared of trojans overhearing, i’ll stand tall.
no one’s about to out-brain or out-muscle me that easy, facts.”

the achaean squad prays, “zeus from ida, oh lord,
give ajax the w, or if you love hector too, at least keep it even.”
then ajax slaps on that thick bronze, shining like an apex predator.
he steps out, huge as the war-god ares strolling into a battlefield,
the argives cheer, the trojans quake in their sandals,
hector feels his chest tighten but he can’t bail—he called for this smoke, after all.

ajax stands, brandishing a monstrous shield like a fortress wall,
crafted by tychios, best leatherworker around—seven layers of tough bull-hide with an eighth of bronze on top.
he’s like, “hector, time to see the real talk. yeah, achilles is sulking by the ships,
but me and my homies can still throw down. so let’s go.”

hector's retort: “bro, you think i’m some noob or a clueless chick who doesn’t know war?
i know how to scrap—i can pivot left or right with the spear, i can brawl up close or charge in a chariot.
but i won’t try no cheap shot, i’ll come at you head-on.”
boom, he hurls his spear; it tears through six layers of ajax’s shield but stops at the seventh.
ajax returns fire, smashing through hector’s shield and grazing his side,
hector barely dodges death—like, man’s ankles almost folded.

they yank out their spears, rushing each other like savage beasts fighting over territory.
hector nails the center of ajax’s shield, but the point just bends;
ajax rams hector’s shield so hard it staggers him,
slashing his neck, drawing black blood. but hector’s still in the game.
he lifts a massive rock—big, jagged, dark—and hurls it, smashing ajax’s shield center.
ajax picks up an even bigger rock and throws it like an absolute unit,
wrecking hector’s shield and buckling his knees.
hector hits the ground but apollo lifts him up, no meltdown allowed.

they’d have gone ham with swords next if the heralds,
zeus’s (and mankind’s) official refs, hadn’t stepped in.
they plant scepters between the fighters and command:
“bro, enough. y’all are both beloved by cloud-gatherer zeus,
both savage with the spear. but it’s nighttime, so dial it back.”

ajax’s like, “fine, but hector started it, so let him speak first if we’re packing it in.”
hector, big flashing-helmet savage, nods:
“yeah, you got size and smarts, brah. let’s pause for today,
tomorrow we can let the gods pick who wins.
night’s here, it’s good to vibe with the darkness. let me hype my trojans and queens in troy,
and you do the same with your day ones at the ships.
but before we bounce, let’s swap some dope gifts—
so folks can say, ‘they threw hands, but parted in respect, frfr.’”

hector hands ajax this sword with silver nails and a fancy sheath,
ajax returns the vibe with a red-glowing belt.
they each head back: trojans hype that hector survived that beast ajax,
achaeans hype that ajax didn’t get folded by troy’s golden boy.
when ajax rolls up, the whole camp celebrates him like he just took a major w.

agamemnon kills a five-year-old bull for zeus, the almighty,
everyone feasts, and he gifts ajax a fat share of the prime cuts.
once they’re done stuffing their faces, nestor the wise old head stands again:
“yo, we lost a lot of real ones out there, their blood soaks the scamander’s banks.
tomorrow, let's call a ceasefire, gather and burn our dead,
send their ashes home if we ever get back to greece.
plus, let's build a big ol’ wall with towers and a moat around our ships,
just so the trojans can’t flex on us too easy.”

they all vibe with that plan, trojans likewise hold assembly up near priam’s doors.
antênor, an og with sense, says:
“honestly, let's just give helen back, plus the stuff paris swiped.
we messed up big time by breaking that treaty. this war’s not goin our way.”
but paris is like, “nah fam, i ain’t giving up my wifey. y’all can cry about it,
but i’ll return the loot i took from argos, plus extra if that helps.”

priam stands, voice of reason, “everyone go eat and guard the walls,
then at dawn, i’ll send idaïos the herald to propose the trojans’ terms,
and request a break for funeral rites, after which we can scrap again if that’s the vibe.”

dawn breaks, idaïos heads to the achaean ships,
finds them gathered, shares paris’s lame half-offer,
and also requests a day to gather and burn the trojan dead.
diomedes cuts him off: “lol, no. we’re not taking paris’s trash ransom or returning helen.
we all know troy’s heading for total meltdown.”
the achaean ranks applaud that savage line.

still, agamemnon is fine with letting trojans bury their fallen, “no one’s savage enough to block funeral fires.”
and so idaïos returns to troy with this answer, trojans hear it, they hurry to collect corpses and wood,
achaeans do the same on their side—blood, tears, all of it.
they burn their dead in silent sorrow and at dawn build a single communal mound,
then throw up the fortress with gates and towers around their ships,
dig a deep trench, line it with stakes—like “try us, trojans.”

the gods on olympus are side-eyeing all this, and poseidon rants to zeus:
“bro, the achaeans didn’t even sacrifice to us while building this wall. disrespectful.
they’ll overshadow the walls i helped build for laomedon in troy. wack.”
zeus chuckles, “relax, sea-bro. once the achaeans sail home,
you can crush that puny wall into the sea, bury the beach in sand. done deal.”

sun sets, the wall is done, everyone feasts on beef and wine.
ships arrive from lemnos, courtesy of eunêos (jason’s son), bringing huge loads of wine.
the achaeans buy up the goods with bronze, iron, hides, cattle, slaves—
everyone parties all night, but a dark vibe weighs heavy as zeus thunders overhead.
the trojans quake in fear, pour out their wine offerings on the ground,
nobody daring to drink until they pray to the big boss cronion first.
then they crash, letting that uneasy sleep take them.
