around this time, some clout-chasing reporter from new york showed up at gatsby’s door one morning and asked him if he had any alpha, sigma, or ligma to share.

"yo, any what now, bestie?" gatsby asked, politely but lowkey confused.

"yo, you know, like a statement, bestie. for the clout, fr."

after five minutes of cringe-worthy conversation, it turned out the guy had heard gatsby’s name in his office and, with the kind of initiative that only a true go-getter has, he’d hurried out to “get the scoop.” it was his day off, but the grind never stops, you know?

it was a total long shot, but the reporter’s instincts were on point. gatsby’s fame, spread by the hundreds of people who had accepted his hospitality and then acted like they knew everything about him, had been growing all summer until he was just short of being a full-blown meme. contemporary legends, like the “underground pipeline to canada” one, were attached to him, and there was one persistent rumor that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was secretly moved up and down the long island shore. why these fan-fictions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota, is hard to say.

james gatz—that was his real name, or at least his legal name. he’d changed it when he was seventeen, at the exact moment his career began—when he saw dan cody’s yacht drop anchor on the most sus flat on lake superior. it was james gatz who was loafing on the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the tuolomee, and told cody that a storm was coming and he was about to get wrecked.

i guess he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. his parents were broke and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. the truth was that jay gatsby of west egg, long island, was a self-made man, a product of his own platonic conception of himself. he was a son of god—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he had to be about his father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and tacky beauty. so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and he was true to this invention to the very end.

for over a year, he’d been grinding along the south shore of lake superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher, or whatever else paid the bills. his tan, muscular body was a product of the half-fierce, half-lazy work of those bracing days. he knew women early, and since they spoiled him, he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were naive, of the others because they were dramatic about things that, in his overwhelming self-absorption, he took for granted.

but his heart was in a constant state of chaos. the most grotesque and fantastic delusions haunted him at night. a universe of unbelievable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked his tangled clothes on the floor with wet light. each night, he added to the pattern of his fantasies until sleep finally closed in on some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. for a while, these daydreams were an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfying hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the world was built on a fairy’s wing.

an instinct for his future glory had led him, a few months before, to the small lutheran college of st. olaf’s in southern minnesota. he stayed there for two weeks, disgusted by its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and hating the janitor work he had to do to pay his way. then he drifted back to lake superior, and he was still looking for something to do on the day that dan cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows.

cody was fifty then, a product of the nevada silver fields, of the yukon, of every gold rush since ‘75. the montana copper deals that made him a multi-millionaire had left him physically strong but mentally soft, and, sensing this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. the not-so-savory story of how ella kaye, the newspaper woman, played madame de maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, was common knowledge in the trashy journalism of 1902. he’d been sailing along the coast for five years when he showed up as james gatz’s destiny in little girl bay.

to young gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the yacht's deck, that boat represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. it was basically the ultimate aesthetic flex - pure generational wealth energy manifested as a floating palace, and james gatz was absolutely obsessed with that level of luxury manifestation.

the boat was giving "main character yacht vibes" that completely shattered his peasant-tier worldview and opened his eyes to what peak life optimization could actually look like. this wasn't just transportation - this was a whole lifestyle upgrade to premium content mode, the kind of wealth flex that most people could only dream about achieving.

i guess he smiled at cody—he'd probably figured out that people liked him when he smiled. that smile was his first sigma move, fr - he intuitively understood that charisma was basically his only currency in this situation, and he was about to invest everything he had into making the right impression.

anyway, cody asked him a few questions (one of which got him the new name) and found out that he was smart and ambitious as hell. the old man could sense that this kid had serious main character energy trapped inside a broke peasant existence, and he recognized the hunger for transformation that was absolutely radiating from every interaction.

cody understood that raw ambition when properly cultivated could create the most loyal and dedicated employee you could ever hope to find. this wasn't just charity - this was strategic talent acquisition, and gatz was clearly operating on a different level than your average lake superior clam-digger.

a few days later, he took him to duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. it was basically a complete aesthetic rebrand from broke farm boy to yacht crew member - the kind of transformation that would make modern makeover shows absolutely jealous with the dramatic glow-up energy.

and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the barbary coast, gatsby left too. james gatz died that day, honestly - not literally, but spiritually he ceased to exist as a real person, replaced entirely by this new performance of wealth and sophistication that would define the rest of his life.

he was employed in a vague, personal capacity—while he was with cody, he was, in turn, a steward, a mate, a skipper, a secretary, and even a jailer, because sober dan cody knew what drunk dan cody was capable of, and he prepared for those situations by trusting gatsby more and more. the arrangement lasted for five years, during which the boat went around the continent three times. it might have lasted forever if ella kaye hadn’t come on board one night in boston and, a week later, dan cody unceremoniously died.

i remember the portrait of him in gatsby’s bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face—the original pioneer bro, who brought the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon to the east coast. it was partly because of cody that gatsby drank so little. sometimes, at his parties, women would rub champagne in his hair; for himself, he made a habit of leaving the liquor alone.

and it was from cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. he never got it. he never understood the legal loophole that was used against him, but what was left of the millions went to ella kaye.

the whole inheritance situation was basically gatsby's first lesson in how the system really worked - even when you played by the rules and earned your position, there were always people with better connections and superior legal knowledge who could snatch victory away at the last moment.

ella kaye's manipulation of the inheritance was giving serious "corporate villain origin story" energy - she had systematically infiltrated cody's life, identified his vulnerabilities, and executed a perfect long-term strategy to acquire his wealth. it was honestly impressive from a tactical perspective, even if it was morally bankrupt.

gatsby's failure to understand the legal mechanisms that were used against him showed how unprepared he was for the sophisticated forms of exploitation that wealthy people used against each other. his small-town farm boy background had given him exactly zero preparation for this level of strategic financial warfare.

the fact that he accepted this loss and used it as motivation rather than letting it destroy him was probably what distinguished gatsby from other people who got crushed by similar experiences. most people would have given up and accepted their peasant-tier destiny, but gatsby saw it as valuable education in how power really operated.

he was left with his uniquely appropriate education; the vague idea of jay gatsby had finally become a real man. but it was education purchased with complete financial devastation, and it had taught him that legitimate success could be stolen just as easily as illegitimate success could be achieved.

he told me all this much later, but i'm putting it here to debunk all the wild rumors about his past, which were all fake news. the conspiracy theories about gatsby were honestly more entertaining than the truth, but they were giving serious "social media misinformation" energy that needed to be corrected.

besides, he told it to me at a time of confusion, when i was ready to believe anything and nothing about him. my mental state was basically "chronically online conspiracy theorist meets unreliable narrator," which was definitely not the ideal mindset for processing complex biographical information.

so i'm taking advantage of this short break, while gatsby, so to speak, catches his breath, to clear up these misconceptions. the pause in the drama gave me time to organize the actual facts and separate them from the wild speculation that had been circulating through west egg's gossip network.

it was a break in my involvement in his affairs, too. for several weeks, i didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone—i was mostly in new york, hanging out with jordan and trying to get on her ancient aunt's good side—but i finally went over to his house one sunday afternoon.

the whole social courtship process with jordan's family was honestly exhausting, requiring careful navigation of ancient etiquette rules and generational wealth dynamics that made gatsby's parties look like casual hangouts.

i hadn't been there for two minutes when someone brought tom buchanan in for a drink. i was startled, of course, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before.

they were a group of three on horseback—tom, a guy named sloane, and a pretty woman in a brown riding outfit who had been there before.

"yo sigma bros, absolutely iconic that you dropped by," gatsby said, standing on his porch with that premium host energy. "this is giving me main character moment vibes, no cap."

as if they cared.

"sit down, legends. cigarette? cigar? whatever's your vibe." he rushed around the room, ringing bells like he was summoning his entire staff. "i'll get you the premium beverage experience in just a minute, trust the process."

he was deeply affected by the fact that tom was there. but he would have been uncomfortable anyway until he had given them something, vaguely realizing that that was all they came for. mr. sloane didn’t want anything. a lemonade? no, thanks. a little champagne? nothing at all, thanks… i’m sorry—

"yo, did you have a nice ride, bestie?"

"yo, the roads around here are literally great, no cap."

"yo, i guess the cars—"

"yo, yeah, fr."

moved by an irresistible impulse, gatsby turned to tom, who had accepted the introduction like a stranger.

"yo, i think we've literally met before, mr. buchanan, sigma bro."

"oh, obviously," tom said with that gruff alpha energy, clearly not remembering but asserting dominance anyway. "yeah, we definitely did. i remember every peasant who enters my territory."

"yo, about two weeks ago, bestie."

"yeah, that's right, bestie. you were with nick here."

"yo, i know your wife, sigma bro," gatsby continued, almost aggressively.

"yo, is that so, bestie?"

tom turned to me.

"yo, you live near here, nick, bestie?"

"yo, next door, bestie."

“is that so?”

mr. sloane didn’t join the conversation, but lounged back in his chair, looking arrogant; the woman didn’t say anything either—until, unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became friendly.

"yo, we'll literally all come to your next party, mr. gatsby, bestie," she suggested. "what do you say, fr?"

"yo, of course, sigma bros; i'd literally be delighted to have you, no cap."

"yo, that would be very nice, bestie," mr. sloane said, without a hint of gratitude. "well—fr, i think we should be heading home."

"yo, please don't rush, sigma bros," gatsby urged them. he had himself under control now, and he wanted to see more of tom. "why don't you—bestie, why don't you stay for supper? fr, i wouldn't be surprised if some other people from new york dropped in."

"yo, you come to supper with me, bestie," the lady said, enthusiastically. "literally both of you, fr."

that included me. mr. sloane got to his feet.

"yo, come on, bestie," he said—but only to her.

"fr, i mean it," she insisted with enthusiasm. "i'd literally love to have you. we have plenty of room, bestie."

gatsby looked at me, questioning. he wanted to go, and he didn’t see that mr. sloane had already decided he wasn’t coming.

"yo, i'm afraid i can't make it," i said, lowkey wanting to avoid this situation.

"well bestie, you come," she urged, focusing on gatsby with determined energy.

mr. sloane whispered something in her ear.

"we literally won't be late if we start now," she insisted, loudly giving persistent energy.

"yo, i don't have a horse," gatsby said with slight embarrassment. "i used to ride in the army, but never bought one for the estate. i'll have to follow you in my car though, sigma bros. excuse me for a minute."

the rest of us walked out onto the porch, where sloane and the lady started a heated, private conversation.

"alpha move, this guy's actually showing up," tom said with aggressive territorial energy. "doesn't he understand basic boundary control? she's under my protection here."

"yo, she literally said she does, bestie."

"she's hosting a premium social gathering, and this peasant won't know a single alpha there." he frowned with that toxic possessive energy. "i need to investigate where the hell he infiltrated daisy's territory. look, i may have traditional values, but women need proper alpha supervision these days. without territory control, they encounter all kinds of low-tier weirdos."

suddenly, mr. sloane and the lady walked down the steps and got on their horses.

"yo, come on," mr. sloane said to tom with impatience, "we're late. we have to go, fr." and then to me, "tell him we couldn't wait, will you bestie?"

tom and i shook hands, the rest of us gave each other a cool nod, and they trotted off down the drive, disappearing under the august leaves just as gatsby, with his hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.

tom was clearly annoyed by daisy's running around alone, because the following saturday night, he came with her to gatsby's party. it was giving serious "controlling alpha monitoring his territory" energy - he couldn't handle the idea of daisy experiencing life without his direct supervision and intimidation tactics.

the dude was absolutely pressed about losing control of his narrative, and showing up to gatsby's party was basically his way of asserting dominance over a situation that was making him feel uncomfortably powerless. this wasn't social courtesy - this was a strategic surveillance mission disguised as date night.

maybe his presence was what gave the evening its weird, oppressive vibe—it stands out in my memory from gatsby's other parties that summer. it was like having a toxic energy vampire show up to a healing crystal convention - everything immediately felt contaminated by his aggressive territorial anxiety and barely contained rage.

there were the same people, or at least the same kind of people, the same endless supply of champagne, the same multicolored, multi-keyed chaos, but i felt an unpleasantness in the air, a harshness that hadn't been there before. tom's presence was basically a reality check that reminded everyone this wasn't actually a safe space - it was still a world where money talked and violence lurked just beneath the surface of every interaction.

the whole vibe shifted from "chaotic party energy" to "potential crime scene" the moment he walked in, fr. you could literally feel the social dynamics change as people subconsciously recognized the threat level had just escalated dramatically.

or maybe i had just gotten used to it, grown to accept west egg as its own little world, with its own rules and its own celebrities, second to none because it had no idea it was second to none, and now i was seeing it again, through daisy's eyes. it's always sad to see things you've gotten used to through a new pair of eyes.

through daisy's east egg perspective, gatsby's parties probably looked like elaborate peasant cosplay - new money trying desperately to buy sophistication but missing all the subtle cultural codes that actually defined real class. it was giving "rich kid slumming it for the aesthetic" energy, and that realization was honestly devastating to witness.

they arrived at twilight, and as we walked through the sparkling crowds, daisy’s voice was doing weird, breathy things in her throat.

"these things literally excite me so much," she whispered with valley girl energy. "if you want to kiss me at any point during the evening, nick, just let me know and i'll be happy to arrange it for you, bestie. just say my name, fr. or show a green card. i'm giving out green ones—"

"yo, look around," gatsby suggested with host energy.

"i'm literally looking around, bestie. i'm having an absolutely marvelous—"

"yo, you must literally see the faces of many people you've heard about, bestie."

tom’s arrogant eyes scanned the crowd.

"yo, we don't get out much, bestie," he said. "fr, i was just thinking i don't know a single person here."

"yo, maybe you know that lady, sigma bros." gatsby pointed to a gorgeous, almost inhumanly perfect woman who was sitting like a queen under a white-plum tree. tom and daisy stared, with that weird, unreal feeling you get when you see a celebrity in real life for the first time.

"she's absolutely iconic, literally stunning," daisy said with that signature valley girl energy.

"yo, the man bending over her is literally her director, bestie."

he took them from group to group, making introductions.

"yo, mrs. buchanan… and mr. buchanan, bestie—" after a moment's hesitation, he added, "the polo player."

"yo, oh no, bestie," tom objected, quickly, "not me."

but gatsby apparently liked the sound of it, because tom was “the polo player” for the rest of the night.

“i’ve never met so many celebrities,” daisy exclaimed. “i liked that man—what was his name?—with the kind of blue nose.”

gatsby told her who he was, adding that he was a small-time producer.

“well, i liked him anyway.”

“i’d rather not be the polo player,” tom said, pleasantly. “i’d rather just watch all these famous people in… oblivion.”

daisy and gatsby danced. i remember being surprised by his graceful, old-fashioned foxtrot—i’d never seen him dance before. then they walked over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while i, at her request, stood guard in the garden. “in case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of god.”

tom reappeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper. “do you mind if i eat with some people over here?” he said. “a guy’s telling some funny stories.”

“go ahead,” daisy said, cheerfully, “and if you want to get any numbers, here’s my little gold pencil.” … she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and i knew that except for the half-hour she’d spent alone with gatsby, she wasn’t having a good time.

we were at a particularly drunk table. that was my fault—gatsby had been called to the phone, and i'd enjoyed these same people just two weeks before. but what had been funny then was just toxic now.

the whole energy had shifted from "chaotic party vibes" to "uncomfortable cringe content" because tom's presence was basically poisoning every interaction with his aggressive judgment and barely contained disgust. these people went from being quirky party characters to examples of everything wrong with new money culture.

it was like watching a sitcom turn into a documentary about wealth inequality - the same behaviors that seemed charming and eccentric when you were just vibing suddenly looked desperate and performative when viewed through the lens of old money snobbery.

the drunk conversations that had been entertaining two weeks ago now felt hollow and try-hard, like watching people cosplay as sophistication without understanding any of the cultural references they were trying to appropriate. tom's toxic energy was basically a reality filter that made everything look fake and embarrassing.

plus, tom kept making these subtle comments under his breath that were clearly designed to make everyone feel inferior and unwelcome. it was giving serious "main character villain energy" - he wasn't just attending the party, he was systematically destroying it from the inside.

daisy was trying to maintain her valley girl enthusiasm, but you could tell she was getting increasingly uncomfortable with the whole situation. she was caught between wanting to defend gatsby's world and not wanting to completely alienate tom, which was honestly an impossible position.

meanwhile, everyone at the table could sense the tension but nobody wanted to acknowledge it directly, so we were all just sitting there pretending everything was normal while the social atmosphere slowly disintegrated around us. it was absolutely unhinged, fr.

but first, let me tell you about the epic library discovery that happened earlier, because that whole situation was absolutely unhinged. it started when jordan lowkey got pressed by the east egg crowd she was sitting with.

"let's get out," she whispered to me after like thirty minutes of the most performative bougie behavior i'd ever witnessed. "this energy is mid, and i'm not here for it."

so we got up, and she explained that we needed to find gatsby since she'd never actually met him, which was giving her anxiety. i was like, fr, that is pretty sus to be at someone's party without meeting them.

the bar was absolutely packed but no gatsby. we checked the veranda - nothing. jordan was getting increasingly pressed about the whole situation when she spotted this important-looking door.

"bet he's in there," she said with that confident energy that only jordan could pull off.

we walked into what was basically a whole movie set - this massive gothic library with carved english oak paneling that was definitely giving "imported from some ancient castle" vibes. and sitting on this enormous table, absolutely wasted, was this middle-aged guy with the most ridiculous owl-eye glasses i'd ever seen in my life.

the moment we walked in, he whipped around and straight-up analyzed jordan from head to toe like she was a whole exhibit.

"yo, what do you think?" he demanded, gesturing wildly at the bookshelves with the kind of theatrical energy that suggested he'd been waiting hours for someone to ask him this exact question.

"about what exactly?" jordan replied, giving him that effortlessly superior look that could end careers. her tone was carefully neutral, but you could tell she was already mentally calculating how to escape this interaction.

he waved dramatically at the entire wall of books like he was revealing the secrets of the universe. the gesture was so over-the-top that it was giving serious "drunk professor discovering the library of alexandria" energy.

"about THAT, bestie. but honestly, you don't even need to investigate because i already did the research for you. they're real." he said it with such triumphant excitement, like he'd just solved one of the great mysteries of modern civilization through careful scientific observation.

the dude was clearly having some kind of philosophical breakthrough about the nature of authenticity versus performance, but he was processing it through several layers of alcohol and party chaos. it was like watching someone have an intellectual epiphany while completely wasted.

"wait, the books though?" i asked, because this whole interaction was absolutely sending me with second-hand embarrassment energy. i was lowkey fascinated by his genuine amazement at discovering that books contained actual pages.

he nodded so enthusiastically i thought his glasses might fall off. his whole body was vibrating with excitement, like he'd just discovered that water was wet or that gravity existed.

"absolutely, completely, one-hundred-percent real. pages and everything! i deadass thought they'd be fancy cardboard, you know? like fake display books for the aesthetic. but these are legitimate, actual books with real pages and - yo, let me show you the evidence!"

the fact that he was so surprised by basic book functionality was giving me insight into the general level of authenticity he was used to encountering at gatsby's parties. apparently everything else was so performative and fake that discovering something genuine was literally mind-blowing.

it was honestly kind of sad - this man was having a profound emotional experience just from encountering real literature in a world where everything else was elaborate simulation and aesthetic performance. the books represented something authentic in gatsby's carefully constructed fantasy world.

he stumbled over to the bookshelf and grabbed some random leather-bound volume, nearly face-planting in the process.

"look at this! real pages! this dude gatsby is operating on a whole different level of authenticity! i've been drunk at fancy parties before, but this is giving me 'generational wealth with actual culture' energy, not just 'new money trying too hard' vibes!"

jordan gave him one of her cutting looks. "impressive," she said in that tone that somehow made it sound like the opposite.

"right? like, most people would just get the aesthetic books for the gram, but this man said 'no, i need the complete literary experience.' it's giving main character energy, no cap."

the drunk guy carefully placed the book back on the shelf like he was handling sacred artifacts.

"but here's the thing that's really sending me," he continued, swaying slightly, "he didn't even cut the pages. knows exactly when to stop. what kind of calculated perfectionist behavior is that?"

he suddenly grabbed my arm with the intensity of someone about to reveal government secrets.

"who brought you to this premium content experience? because most people here are just clout-chasers who got plus-ones."

"i was brought by some woman named mrs. roosevelt," he announced before we could answer. "been absolutely lit for like a week straight, thought maybe sitting in a library would help me process reality. spoiler alert: it has not."

"working for you?" jordan asked, that subtle shade in her voice hitting different.

"a little bit, maybe? i can't really tell since i've only been here for like an hour. but did i mention the books are real? because they are. legitimately real."

we nodded and headed back outside, leaving owl eyes to continue his literary investigation.

anyway, back to the drunk table situation.

“how are you feeling, miss baedeker?”

the girl who was asked was trying, and failing, to lean against my shoulder. at the question, she sat up and opened her eyes.

“wha’?”

a large, lethargic woman, who had been trying to get daisy to play golf with her at the local club the next day, came to miss baedeker’s defense.

“oh, she’s fine now. when she’s had five or six cocktails, she always starts screaming like that. i tell her she should just stick to water.”

“i do stick to water,” the accused said, hollowly.

“we heard you yelling, so i said to doc civet here, ‘there’s someone who needs your help, doc.’”

“she’s very grateful, i’m sure,” said another friend, sarcastically, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”

“i hate getting my head stuck in a pool,” miss baedeker mumbled. “they almost drowned me once in new jersey.”

“then you should stick to water,” dr. civet countered.

“speak for yourself!” miss baedeker cried, violently. “your hand is shaking. i wouldn’t let you operate on me!”

it was like that. almost the last thing i remember was standing with daisy and watching the movie director and his star. they were still under the white-plum tree, and their faces were so close they were almost touching, except for a thin ray of moonlight between them. it occurred to me that he had been slowly leaning in all evening to get that close, and even as i watched, i saw him stoop that last little bit and kiss her on the cheek.

"i'm literally obsessed with her," daisy said with this conspiratorial whisper. "she's giving main character energy, bestie."

but the rest of it offended her—and it was undeniably because it wasn’t a performance, but a real emotion. she was appalled by west egg, this bizarre “place” that broadway had created in a long island fishing village—appalled by its raw energy that didn’t care about the old rules, and by the too-obvious fate that herded its people along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. she saw something awful in the very simplicity she couldn’t understand.

i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. it was dark out front; only the bright doorway sent a ten-foot square of light out into the soft, black morning. sometimes a shadow would move against a dressing-room window upstairs, then another, an endless procession of shadows, putting on makeup in an invisible mirror.

"who the hell is this gatsby peasant, anyway?" tom demanded suddenly with aggressive alpha interrogation energy. "some beta-tier criminal trying to flex in my territory?"

the question came out of nowhere, but honestly it had been building all night. tom had been systematically cataloging every detail of gatsby's operation, looking for weaknesses he could exploit to maintain his social dominance hierarchy. this wasn't casual curiosity - this was strategic intelligence gathering.

his whole body language screamed "territorial threat assessment" as he paced around, clearly agitated by the fact that someone was operating at his wealth level without his permission or oversight. the idea that gatsby could exist independently of his social network was apparently giving him major anxiety.

"where'd you hear that?" i asked, even though i could tell this was just tom's paranoid brain working overtime to create conspiracy theories that would justify his hostility toward someone who was clearly operating on his level.

"i didn't hear it. i made it up. a lot of these new-money people are just big bootleggers, you know." he said it with such aggressive certainty, like the act of speculation was equivalent to having actual evidence. typical toxic alpha behavior - creating reality through assertion rather than investigation.

the bootlegger accusation was basically his way of delegitimizing gatsby's entire existence without having to acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, someone could achieve wealth and success through methods that didn't involve generational inheritance and systematic exploitation.

"not gatsby," i said, curtly, because honestly tom's whole conspiracy theory approach was getting on my nerves. he was so desperate to find dirt on gatsby that he was willing to just make stuff up rather than accept that his territorial dominance might be legitimately challenged.

he was quiet for a moment. the gravel crunched under his feet as he processed the fact that his fishing expedition hadn't yielded any useful intelligence. you could practically see his brain trying to recalculate his strategy for dealing with this threat to his social ecosystem.

"well, he must have worked hard to get this whole zoo together." the admission came out grudgingly, like acknowledging gatsby's achievement was physically painful for him. but even his compliment was backhanded - calling it a "zoo" instead of a party, reducing gatsby's sophisticated operation to something chaotic and uncontrolled.

a breeze stirred the gray haze of daisy’s fur collar.

“at least they’re more interesting than the people we know,” she said, with an effort.

“you didn’t seem that interested.”

“well, i was.”

tom laughed and turned to me.

“did you see daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”

daisy started to sing along with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, giving each word a meaning it had never had before and would never have again. when the melody rose, her voice broke sweetly, following it, the way contralto voices do, and each change released a little of her warm, human magic into the air.

“lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said, suddenly. “that girl wasn’t invited. they just force their way in, and he’s too polite to say no.”

"i need full intel on this threat to my domain," tom insisted with that alpha control energy. "this is definitely going to be my business to investigate and neutralize any challenges to my territory."

his whole approach was giving serious "toxic masculine surveillance state" vibes - the idea that anyone could operate successfully in his sphere without his explicit permission was clearly triggering his deepest insecurities about wealth, power, and social dominance.

you could tell that tom's brain was working overtime to develop a comprehensive strategy for dealing with gatsby. this wasn't just social curiosity - this was military-level intelligence gathering designed to identify weaknesses that could be exploited in future conflicts.

the fact that gatsby had achieved wealth without tom's approval or oversight was basically an existential threat to his entire worldview. if people could just... make money and buy status without going through proper channels, what did that say about the legitimacy of his own inherited position?

"i can tell you right now," she answered. "he owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. he built them up himself."

daisy's explanation was clearly designed to defuse tom's paranoia by providing a boring, legitimate origin story that would satisfy his need for simple answers. drugstores were mundane enough to be believable, successful enough to explain the wealth, and boring enough to reduce gatsby's threat level.

but you could tell tom wasn't entirely convinced - his whole posture suggested he was still processing this information and looking for hidden implications. the idea that gatsby was just a successful small business owner was almost more threatening than criminal activity, because it suggested that anyone with enough ambition could achieve his level of success.

tom's face was doing this weird calculation where he was trying to figure out if "drugstore owner" was respectable enough to justify gatsby's wealth or suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. it was giving major "rich person trying to categorize threats" energy.

the whole exchange was basically a perfect example of how old money approaches new money - with a mixture of fascination, disgust, and defensive territorialism that reveals more about the observer than the observed. tom couldn't just accept gatsby's success; he had to find a way to diminish or delegitimize it.

daisy's willingness to provide this explanation also showed how she was trying to navigate between the two men without completely alienating either one. she was basically serving as a diplomatic translator between two different types of wealth psychology.

the slow limousine came rolling up the drive.

“good night, nick,” said daisy.

her eyes left me and went to the lighted top of the steps, where “three o’clock in the morning,” a neat, sad little waltz from that year, was drifting out of the open door. after all, in the very casualness of gatsby’s party, there were romantic possibilities that were completely absent from her world. what was it in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? what would happen now in the dim, unknowable hours? maybe some unbelievable guest would arrive, someone infinitely rare and amazing, some genuinely radiant young girl who, with one fresh look at gatsby, one moment of magical connection, would erase those five years of unwavering devotion.

i stayed late that night. gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had come running up from the black beach, chilled and exhilarated, until the lights went out in the guest rooms upstairs. when he finally came down the steps, his tanned skin was stretched unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.

“she didn’t like it,” he said, immediately.

“of course she did.”

“she didn’t like it,” he insisted. “she didn’t have a good time.”

he was silent, and i could feel his deep depression.

“i feel so far away from her,” he said. “it’s hard to make her understand.”

“you mean about the party?”

"the party?" he dismissed all the parties he had ever thrown with a snap of his fingers. "sigma bro, the party is irrelevant."

he wanted nothing less from daisy than for her to go to tom and say, “i never loved you.” after she had erased four years with that one sentence, they could figure out the more practical details. one of them was that, after she was free, they would go back to louisville and get married in her house—just as if it were five years ago.

“and she doesn’t understand,” he said. “she used to be able to understand. we’d sit for hours—”

he broke off and started pacing up and down a desolate path of fruit peels and discarded party favors and crushed flowers.

“i wouldn’t ask too much of her,” i suggested. “you can’t repeat the past.”

“can’t repeat the past?” he cried, incredulously. “why, of course you can!”

he looked around wildly, as if the past were hiding here in the shadows of his house, just out of his reach.

“i’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding with determination. “she’ll see.”

he talked a lot about the past, and i gathered that he wanted to get back something, some idea of himself, maybe, that had gone into loving daisy. his life had been a mess since then, but if he could just go back to a certain starting point and go over it all slowly, he could figure out what that thing was…

the way he talked about it was absolutely unhinged - like he genuinely believed that life was just a video game where you could reload a previous save file and try again with better strategies. it was giving major "main character delusion" energy, the kind of thinking that only someone with infinite resources and zero real-world consequences could maintain.

but honestly, i understood the obsession. gatsby had built his entire identity around this one perfect moment in time, and everything that came after felt like a betrayal of that original vision. he was basically trapped in a loop of trying to recreate something that had never really existed in the first place.

the dude was operating on pure manifestation energy, convinced that if he just accumulated enough wealth and social status, he could literally rewrite the past and make it conform to his fantasy version of events. it was simultaneously admirable and absolutely tragic to witness.

… one autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street as the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. they stopped there and turned to each other. it was a cool night, with that mysterious excitement that comes with the changing of the seasons. the quiet lights in the houses were humming in the darkness, and there was a stir and a bustle among the stars.

the whole scene was giving peak romantic energy - like something out of a netflix movie that was specifically designed to make you believe in soulmates and destiny. it was the kind of moment that feels so perfect it doesn't seem real, which probably should have been a warning sign.

out of the corner of his eye, gatsby saw that the sidewalk blocks were really a ladder leading up to a secret place above the trees—he could climb it, if he climbed alone, and once he was there, he could drink the milk of wonder from the pap of life.

this was basically gatsby's origin story as a hopeless romantic - the exact moment when he decided that reality was optional and that willpower could triumph over literally everything else. it was pure sigma manifestation philosophy in its most dangerous form.

his heart beat faster as daisy's white face came closer to his. he knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever joined his unspeakable visions to her mortal breath, his mind would never be free again like the mind of god. so he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck on a star.

the cosmic imagery was absolutely sending me - gatsby really thought he was living in some kind of mythological narrative where kissing the right person would unlock the secrets of the universe. it was giving "chosen one protagonist" energy, which explains why reality kept disappointing him so dramatically.

then he kissed her. at his lips' touch, she blossomed for him like a flower, and the incarnation was complete. and that was it - the moment that defined the rest of his life, the standard by which every other experience would be measured and found lacking. no wonder he was so desperate to go back and try again.

through everything he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, i was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that i had heard somewhere a long time ago. for a moment, a phrase tried to form in my mouth, and my lips parted like a mute's, as if there was more struggling to get out than just a wisp of startled air. but they made no sound, and what i had almost remembered was lost forever.

but yo, as i was walking down the steps thinking deep thoughts about lost memories and whatnot, i realized the evening was definitely not over. like, not even close.

about fifty feet from the front door, there was this absolutely chaotic scene lit up by car headlights that was giving me "reality tv disaster" energy. sitting in the ditch beside the road, right side up but absolutely destroyed, was this brand new car that had literally just left gatsby's driveway maybe two minutes before.

it was giving serious "main character accident" vibes - the kind of spectacular failure that only happens to people who are too drunk to understand basic physics but too rich to face normal consequences. the car looked like it had been attacked by a very specific and surgically precise form of destruction.

one wheel was completely gone - just missing - and half a dozen chauffeurs were standing around staring at it like it was a museum exhibit. their faces were a mixture of professional concern and barely suppressed amusement, like they were witnessing a masterclass in how not to operate a motor vehicle.

the whole scene was absolutely sending me with its perfect representation of new money chaos - unlimited resources combined with zero competence, resulting in the kind of disaster that could only happen at gatsby's house. it was like watching wealth inequality manifest as physical comedy.

meanwhile, all the cars stuck behind the wreck were honking non-stop, creating this cacophony that was lowkey triggering my anxiety. the sound was giving "urban nightmare" energy, especially combined with the flashing headlights and the growing crowd of onlookers who were treating the whole situation like free entertainment.

you could tell this was the kind of incident that would become party legend - the night owl eyes tried to drive without understanding basic automotive requirements. it was going to be talked about for months as the ultimate example of gatsby party chaos.

standing in the middle of the road was this guy in a long coat, looking back and forth between the car and the missing wheel with the most confused expression i'd ever seen in my life. he was swaying slightly in the breeze, clearly still processing the transition from "sitting in a moving vehicle" to "standing next to a mechanical disaster."

"see!" he announced to everyone within earshot, pointing at the ditch. "it went in the ditch."

the fact that his car was in a ditch seemed to absolutely blow his mind, and that's when i recognized the combination of confusion and amazement - it was owl eyes from the library, except now he was even more wasted than before.

"bro, how did this even happen?" someone shouted from the crowd that was rapidly gathering around the disaster scene.

the question seemed to genuinely confuse owl eyes, like he was being asked to explain quantum physics while blackout drunk. he stood there swaying for a moment, clearly trying to process the concept of causation.

he shrugged like he was discussing the weather. "i literally know nothing about cars. zero mechanical knowledge whatsoever." the admission came out with such casual confidence that it was actually impressive - most people would be embarrassed about destroying a vehicle, but owl eyes was treating it like a fun fact about himself.

"but like, did you hit the wall?" someone else called out, pointing at the perfectly intact garden wall that was nowhere near the ditch.

the crowd was getting increasingly invested in solving this mystery, like they were witnessing a real-life episode of csi: rich people problems edition. everyone had theories about what could have caused such a specific type of automotive failure.

"don't even ask me," owl eyes said, waving his hands in the air with complete defeat energy. "i know basically nothing about driving. less than nothing. this just... happened. that's all i can tell you."

the way he said "this just happened" was sending me - like the car had chosen to remove its own wheel through some kind of mechanical suicide rather than continuing to be operated by someone with his level of competence.

one of the chauffeurs was getting increasingly pressed. "yo, if you can't drive, maybe don't drive at night?" he suggested with the kind of logical reasoning that was apparently beyond owl eyes' current comprehension level.

"but i wasn't even trying!" owl eyes protested, looking genuinely offended by the suggestion that he had been attempting to operate the vehicle. "i literally was not even trying to drive!"

this statement caused a moment of collective confusion among the onlookers, because if he wasn't trying to drive, what exactly had he been doing in the driver's seat of a moving automobile? the logic was giving major "drunk philosopher" energy.

an absolutely stunned silence fell over the crowd of onlookers.

"wait, are you trying to unalive yourself?" someone yelled from the back.

"you're lucky it was just a wheel! bad driver and not even trying!"

"no, no, you're misunderstanding the whole situation," owl eyes explained with the patience of someone talking to toddlers. "i wasn't driving. there's literally another person in the car."

the collective gasp that followed this revelation was absolutely iconic. everyone stepped back as the car door slowly opened with this ominous creaking sound. it was giving serious "horror movie reveal" energy, like we were about to witness the emergence of some kind of automotive zombie.

when it finally swung wide, there was this ghostly pause where nobody moved. the anticipation was honestly killing me - you could feel the entire crowd holding its breath, waiting to see what kind of creature would emerge from this mechanical disaster.

then, very slowly, like he was moving through water, this pale guy emerged from the wreck, stumbling and grabbing onto the car for support with these massive uncertain steps. he looked like he'd been transported from another dimension where gravity worked differently and cars were just suggestions rather than actual machines.

his whole appearance was giving "lost soul who accidentally materialized in the wrong century" vibes. the dude was so disoriented that he seemed genuinely surprised to find himself outside the vehicle, like the concept of exiting a car was a completely foreign experience.

completely blinded by all the headlights and confused by the honking chaos, he swayed back and forth for a solid minute before he even noticed owl eyes standing there. watching him try to process his surroundings was like observing someone wake up from the deepest sleep of their life and immediately have to solve a complex puzzle.

the crowd was absolutely mesmerized by this performance - it was better than any entertainment gatsby could have provided inside the house. this was peak unhinged content, the kind of chaos that people would be talking about for years as the definitive gatsby party moment.

you could tell he was trying to apply logic to a situation that had moved far beyond logical reasoning. his brain was clearly working overtime to make sense of how he had gone from "sitting comfortably in a moving vehicle" to "standing next to a wheel-less disaster in a ditch."

"yo, what's the situation?" he asked, calm as anything. "did we run out of gas or something?"

"look!" owl eyes pointed dramatically at the missing wheel.

the drunk passenger stared at the wheel for a long moment, then looked up at the sky like he was expecting it to fall from space.

"oh word, it came off," someone explained helpfully.

he nodded thoughtfully.

"honestly didn't even notice we'd stopped moving."

then, taking a deep breath and straightening up like he was about to make a major announcement, he asked with complete seriousness: "anyone know where there's a gas station around here?"

at least twelve people, some of them barely more sober than he was, tried to explain that you can't drive a car without a wheel attached to it.

"just back it up," he suggested after processing this information. "put it in reverse."

"but the wheel is gone!"

he thought about this for a moment.

"no harm in trying though, right?"

the honking had reached absolutely insane levels at this point, so i just turned away and walked across the lawn toward my house. the cacophony was giving me serious sensory overload - car horns, shouting, the distant sound of gatsby's orchestra still playing, and underneath it all, the weird mechanical creaking of the destroyed vehicle.

it was honestly the perfect metaphor for gatsby's entire existence - beautiful chaos on the surface, but with this underlying current of destruction and incompetence that nobody wanted to acknowledge. the party was still happening, but the magic had been completely shattered by this ridiculous demonstration of wealth without wisdom.

when i looked back one last time, there was this thin slice of moon hanging over gatsby's mansion, making everything look ethereal and perfect again. the lighting was absolutely cinematic - like someone had specifically designed the scene to maximize the romantic aesthetic impact.

all the laughter and music from his still-glowing garden seemed to float in the air, but there was this sudden emptiness flowing from all the windows and doors. it was giving major "hollow victory" energy - gatsby had successfully thrown another legendary party, but at what cost? the whole thing felt increasingly performative and desperate.

gatsby was standing alone on his porch with his hand raised in this formal goodbye gesture, looking like the most isolated person in the world despite being surrounded by his own party. the image was absolutely devastating - this man who had built his entire identity around bringing people together, yet remained fundamentally disconnected from every single person at his own celebration.

he was probably thinking about daisy at that exact moment, wondering if tonight had been enough to prove his worthiness, if the spectacle had finally achieved its intended purpose. but standing there in the moonlight, surrounded by the evidence of his wealth and the chaos it created, he looked more like a tragic king surveying the ruins of his kingdom.

the contrast between his solitary figure and the ongoing party behind him was giving me serious existential crisis energy. this was the american dream in its purest form - infinite resources deployed in service of impossible hopes, resulting in beautiful disasters that entertained everyone except the person creating them.

i could hear the car accident crowd still arguing about wheels and driving competence in the distance, and somehow that felt like the perfect soundtrack for gatsby's lonely vigil. even his triumphs were undermined by forces beyond his control, and he was forever doomed to stand apart from the very world he was desperately trying to join.

the whole scene was giving me serious insight into the fundamental tragedy of new money versus old money dynamics. gatsby could throw the most elaborate parties, buy the most expensive mansion, and curate the most sophisticated guest list, but he would always be performing wealth rather than simply possessing it.

tom and daisy's casual dismissal of his entire world wasn't just snobbery - it was the assertion of a completely different relationship to power and status. they didn't need to prove anything because their legitimacy was inherited and therefore unquestionable.

gatsby's parties were basically elaborate auditions for acceptance into a club that would never actually admit him as a member. every detail was carefully designed to demonstrate his worthiness, but the very effort to demonstrate worthiness proved his fundamental outsider status.

standing there watching him wave goodbye to people who would never truly see him as an equal, i realized that gatsby's greatest tragedy wasn't that he couldn't win daisy back - it was that he couldn't understand why winning her back wouldn't actually solve anything.

the american dream had convinced him that transformation was possible, that you could reinvent yourself completely and transcend your origins. but what he discovered was that while you could change everything about your circumstances, you couldn't change the social dynamics that determined how those circumstances would be interpreted.

his wealth was real, his mansion was real, his parties were real - but the acceptance he was trying to purchase remained forever out of reach, not because he wasn't rich enough, but because he was rich in the wrong way.

watching him there in the moonlight, surrounded by the evidence of his success but fundamentally alone, i understood that gatsby was trapped in an impossible pursuit - trying to buy something that couldn't be sold, trying to earn something that could only be inherited.

the car accident chaos in the background was basically the perfect metaphor for his entire existence - spectacular, expensive, and ultimately pointless destruction that entertained everyone except the person responsible for creating it.
