ii.

about halfway between west egg and new york city the motor road literally rage-quits its entire vibe and hastily joins the railroad track, running beside it for a quarter mile like it's desperately trying to shrink away from witnessing some absolutely cursed desolate area of land that's giving major abandoned server energy. this location is the valley of ashes—basically a fantastic hellscape farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens that look like they were designed by someone who's never seen actual plants before, no cap. the ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke formations, and finally, with a transcendent effort that's giving main character delusion vibes, they manifest as ash-gray npc men who move dimly through the scene like they're lagging with terrible internet connection, already crumbling through the powdery air like they're made of the same cursed dust that covers everything in this godforsaken biome.

occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track with the energy of a funeral procession livestream, gives out this absolutely ghastly creak that sounds like the screams of the damned, then comes to rest like it's given up on existence entirely. immediately the ash-gray worker npcs swarm up with leaden spades that look heavy enough to break their fragile bodies, stirring up an impenetrable cloud of dust that screens their obscure operations from your sight like some kind of apocalyptic fog of war effect. it's giving silent hill but crossed with a particularly depressing minecraft server where someone griefed the entire world with gray blocks and forgot to clean up afterwards, mixed with the existential dread of scrolling through linkedin at 3am while unemployed.

but above this gray wasteland of broken dreams and industrial failure, above the spasms of bleak dust that drift endlessly over the cursed terrain like the ghost of productivity past, you perceive after a moment of staring into this abyss, the eyes of doctor t. j. eckleburg watching over this entire disaster with the energy of a disappointed parent reviewing their child's search history.

the eyes of doctor t. j. eckleburg are blue and absolutely gigantic—their retinas are literally one yard high, which is giving anime protagonist energy but in the most unsettling way possible. they look out of no actual face, but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles that pass over a completely nonexistent nose like some kind of divine being's failed character creation screen where they accidentally hit randomize and just went with it. evidently some absolutely unhinged optometrist with too much time and money set them there to farm engagement and increase his practice visibility in the borough of queens, then either sank down into eternal blindness himself (which is giving tragic irony vibes) or just forgot about his cursed billboard advertisement and moved away to terrorize some other neighborhood with his marketing schemes.

but his eyes, now dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain like an abandoned tiktok account that stopped posting, continue to brood on over this solemn dumping ground with the energy of a security camera that's seen too much. they're not just passively watching the chaos unfold—they're actively judging every single person who passes through, analyzing their life choices, probably keeping a mental scorecard of their moral failures, and definitely forming opinions about their spotify wrapped playlists. it's giving omniscient narrator energy but with the uncomfortable feeling that someone's about to call you out for your questionable music taste and poor life decisions.

the eyes have become this weird cultural landmark in the valley of ashes—people actually point them out to visitors like they're some kind of tourist attraction, which is absolutely unhinged when you think about it. they're basically worshipping a defunct advertisement for medical services that probably hasn't been relevant for decades, but the billboard has achieved this strange immortality through sheer persistence and atmospheric drama.

local residents have developed this whole mythology around the eyes, claiming they move to follow specific people or that they dim when someone particularly evil passes beneath them. it's giving urban legend energy mixed with religious symbolism, like the whole community has collectively decided to turn an old marketing campaign into their unofficial deity of moral judgment.

the psychological impact of having these giant eyes constantly watching over your daily existence is honestly kind of devastating when you really consider it. everyone who lives or works in the valley of ashes has to go about their daily business under this perpetual surveillance, which has got to create some serious paranoia and existential anxiety issues.

it's become clear that dr. eckleburg's eyes function as this perfect metaphor for how capitalism creates its own empty gods—taking commercial imagery and accidentally imbuing it with spiritual significance through abandonment and decay. the eyes watch over a community that was basically sacrificed for industrial progress, now serving as this haunting reminder of how consumer culture promises salvation but delivers only environmental destruction and social decay.

the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river that's probably seen better days and definitely smells like it's giving up on life, and when the drawbridge is raised up to let barges through (which is the only time this place shows any signs of functioning infrastructure), the passengers on waiting trains get trapped into staring at this absolutely dismal scene for as long as half an hour, which is basically a forced meditation on the futility of human existence and industrial progress.

the enforced waiting period creates this weird psychological effect where you're forced to confront the reality of industrial capitalism's human cost, but you're also completely powerless to do anything about it except sit there and witness the devastation. it's like being trapped in a mobile observatory for studying social inequality and environmental destruction.

there is always a halt there of at least a minute, like the universe is forcing everyone to witness this monument to environmental destruction and social decay, and it was specifically because of this mandatory viewing experience that i first met tom buchanan's mistress and got dragged into whatever toxic situationship drama was about to unfold.

the irony was that most of the people on those trains were probably commuting between manhattan and the wealthy long island communities, so they were literally traveling through the wasteland that their prosperity had created on their way to enjoy the benefits of that same system. it was like a daily reminder of the price other people paid for their comfortable lives.

watching people's faces during those enforced stops was honestly fascinating in a morbid way - you could see them trying not to look, trying to distract themselves with newspapers or conversations, anything to avoid acknowledging what was happening right outside their windows. but the valley of ashes demanded to be seen, demanded to be acknowledged as the inevitable consequence of america's obsession with wealth and progress.

the whole geography of the area was basically a perfect metaphor for how american society was organized - the wealthy lived in their pristine enclaves, the poor were trapped in places like the valley of ashes, and everyone else traveled between these extremes while trying not to think too hard about what that meant.

the fact that tom buchanan had a side piece was public knowledge wherever he was known, basically an open secret that everyone was forced to be in on whether they wanted to deal with that energy or not. his acquaintances actively resented the fact that this absolute unit would turn up in popular cafés with her like she was some kind of accessory, then leave her sitting at a table like a piece of designer luggage while he sauntered around the establishment with that toxic alpha swagger, chatting with literally anyone he recognized and making sure everyone knew he could afford to keep a whole ass second woman on retainer just because he felt like it.

the whole situation was giving serious "rich person treating other people like objects" energy, which was honestly repulsive to witness even from a distance. tom's behavior made it clear that he viewed myrtle as just another possession to display, like an expensive watch or a fancy car - something that demonstrated his wealth and power rather than representing an actual human relationship.

what made it even more toxic was how tom seemed to enjoy making people uncomfortable with his blatant disregard for social conventions and basic human decency. he was basically forcing everyone in his social circle to become complicit in his infidelity and his treatment of women as disposable objects, which showed a special kind of psychological cruelty.

the fact that he could behave this way without facing any real social consequences revealed everything you needed to know about how wealth functioned as a shield against accountability. if a poor man had treated women the way tom did, he would have been ostracized immediately, but tom's money meant that people had to tolerate his behavior whether they approved of it or not.

though i was lowkey curious to see what kind of person would willingly sign up to be tom buchanan's mistress (the red flags must have been visible from space), i genuinely had no desire to actually meet her and get dragged into whatever messy situationship drama they had going on—but of course the universe had other plans because this is my villain arc apparently.

i should have known that tom wasn't the type of person who would respect other people's boundaries or comfort levels when it came to his personal entertainment. if he wanted to show off his mistress to someone, he was going to make it happen regardless of whether that person wanted to be involved or not.

the whole situation was giving serious "rich person who's never been told no" energy, where tom genuinely believed that other people existed primarily to serve his whims and provide an audience for whatever drama he felt like creating on any given day.

i was about to learn firsthand just how little agency you actually have when someone with tom's level of wealth and social power decides to involve you in their personal chaos, whether you want to be involved or not.

i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon like the unsuspecting side character i was, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps of despair he literally jumped to his feet with that aggressive alpha energy that screams "i've never been told no in my entire privileged existence," grabbed hold of my elbow like i was his personal property, and straight up physically forced me from the train car against my will. dude had terminal main character syndrome mixed with possessive toxic masculinity energy, and i was about to become his unwilling emotional support sidekick in whatever chaos he was about to unleash.

the physical force he used was honestly shocking - not because it was particularly violent, but because it was so casual and entitled, like he genuinely believed he had the right to move other people around like chess pieces in whatever game he was playing.

"yo, we're getting off right here," he insisted with that commanding tone that rich people use when they assume everyone else exists purely to facilitate their personal entertainment. "i absolutely need you to meet my girl, nick. this is happening whether you want it to or not."

i think he'd been hitting the liquid lunch situation pretty hard, and his determination to drag me along as his witness bordered on straight-up low-key violence mixed with the kind of casual cruelty that only comes from generational wealth and zero accountability. the supercilious assumption was that on a random sunday afternoon i obviously had nothing better to do with my entire existence than serve as an accessory to his extramarital affair and provide moral support for his terrible life choices. the audacity was absolutely sending me, but not in a good way.

i followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence like the compliant npc i apparently was, and we walked back about a hundred yards along the cursed road under doctor eckleburg's persistent, absolutely judgmental stare that was giving major "your parents reviewing your report card" energy. the only building in sight was this small, sad block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the wasteland like a minecraft house that someone built and then immediately abandoned, giving off the vibe of a compact main street that was supposed to be ministering to this godforsaken area but was really just serving as a monument to failed capitalism and broken dreams, completely isolated and contiguous to absolutely nothing that could be considered civilization.

the mini strip mall situation contained three shops that were all giving different flavors of depression: one space was for rent (obviously, because who would want to open a business in literal hell), another was an all-night restaurant that you could only approach by walking along a trail of ashes like some kind of apocalyptic food delivery service, and the third establishment was a garage with a hand-painted sign that read "repairs. george b. wilson. cars bought and sold" in the kind of faded lettering that screamed "this man's dreams died years ago but he's still showing up to work every day out of sheer muscle memory."

i followed tom inside this temple of automotive sadness, already knowing this was going to be an absolutely chaotic experience.

the interior was giving maximum unprosperous energy—bare walls, concrete floors, the kind of place where hope goes to die a slow, dusty death. the only car visible was this absolutely tragic dust-covered wreck of a ford that was literally crouching in a dim corner like it was trying to hide from the shame of its own existence. for a hot second it had occurred to me that maybe this shadow of a garage was actually some kind of elaborate front operation, and that there were probably sumptuous and romantic apartments concealed overhead where the real business was conducted—maybe some kind of speakeasy situation or at least something that would explain why tom was dragging me to this cursed location.

but then the proprietor himself emerged from the door of what i assumed was his office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste cloth with the energy of someone who had given up on maintaining any kind of professional appearance. this was george b. wilson, and he was exactly what you'd expect from someone who chose to run a failing garage in the valley of ashes: a blond, completely spiritless man who looked anemic and faintly handsome in the way that suggested he might have been attractive once before life absolutely destroyed his will to live.

the dude was giving serious "broken american dream" energy - you could tell he'd probably started this business with genuine optimism and entrepreneurial spirit, but years of economic hardship and social isolation had ground him down to this hollow shell of his former self. his clothes were clean but worn thin, suggesting he was still trying to maintain some dignity despite obviously struggling financially.

there was something deeply tragic about watching him move around his own space with this defeated energy, like he was already apologizing for existing in his own business. you could sense that he'd probably been an ambitious young man once, maybe even charismatic, but the valley of ashes had systematically drained him of every ounce of confidence and vitality he'd ever possessed.

his hands were permanently stained with motor oil and grease, but he kept absently wiping them as if he could somehow clean away the evidence of his working-class existence. it was clear he understood that his social status was fixed and immutable - he would always be the broke garage owner that rich people like tom used for their convenience without ever respecting as an equal.

the psychological impact of living under dr. eckleburg's constant surveillance had obviously affected wilson deeply - he moved with this paranoid energy, constantly glancing around like he was being watched and judged, which honestly he probably was. the valley of ashes had created this perfect laboratory for studying how environmental despair could completely destroy a person's sense of self-worth.

when he spotted us standing in his tragic establishment, this damp gleam of hope literally sprang into his light blue eyes like he was seeing his first customers in weeks, which honestly was probably the case given that his business was located in what could only be described as the asshole of america. but even his hope was tinged with this desperate anxiety - you could tell he was terrified of saying or doing something that might drive away potential income.

"yo wilson, my guy," said tom with that fake jovial energy that screams "i'm about to manipulate you but make it seem friendly," literally slapping him on the shoulder like they were bros instead of a predatory rich person and his financially desperate victim. "how's the business situation treating you, king?"

"honestly, i can't complain, no cap," answered wilson in the most unconvincing tone i've ever heard, like he was reading from a script titled "how to pretend your life isn't falling apart 101." the dude was clearly struggling but putting on this brave face because he knew tom held all the power in whatever arrangement they had going on. "but fr, when are you actually going to sell me that car you've been promising? it's been lowkey forever, bestie."

"oh that? next week for sure, bestie," tom replied with the casual confidence of someone who's been saying "next week" for months. "i've got my guy working on it right now, no cap."

"your guy works pretty slow though, doesn't he?" wilson said with this hint of frustration that suggested he'd been getting the runaround for way longer than was reasonable, giving lowkey pressed energy.

"nah bro, he doesn't work slow at all," said tom with a sudden shift to that ice-cold tone that rich people use when poor people dare to question their timeline. "and if you're gonna catch an attitude about it, maybe i should just sell that car somewhere else after all. plenty of other people would love that deal."

the threat was immediate and wilson backtracked so fast it was giving whiplash energy.

"yo, i don't mean it like that, fr," he explained quickly, his voice full of that panicked energy of someone who just realized they might have jeopardized their only financial lifeline. "bestie, i just meant—"

but his voice literally faded off because what could he say? tom had all the power here, and they both knew it. tom glanced impatiently around the garage with the energy of someone who was already bored with this conversation and ready to move on to whatever chaos he had planned next.

then i heard footsteps on some stairs upstairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman absolutely blocked out the light from the office door like she was making the most dramatic entrance possible. this had to be the famous mistress, and she was giving maximum main character energy from the very first second.

she was in her middle thirties, and faintly stout, but somehow she carried her flesh sensuously in that way that some women just know how to do—like she was completely confident in her body and expected everyone else to be obsessed with it too. her face, positioned above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine that was giving "i'm too good for this place but here i am anyway" vibes, contained literally no facet or gleam of conventional beauty, but there was this immediately perceptible vitality radiating from her like she was a live wire that had been plugged directly into the main electrical grid of pure chaotic energy.

the nerves of her body seemed to be continually smoldering with this restless, impatient energy that suggested she was always three seconds away from starting drama or making a scene. she had that absolutely unhinged chaotic energy that screams "i'm about to be the most interesting person in any room i enter and everyone will either love me or hate me but they definitely won't ignore me."

she smiled slowly with this calculated sensuality, and then—in the most savage power move i've ever witnessed—she literally walked through her husband as if he were a transparent ghost that didn't deserve acknowledgment, completely ignoring his existence while she extended her hand to shake tom's like he was the only person in the room worth her attention. she looked him flush in the eye with this intense, meaningful stare that was giving "we have a whole secret relationship and i'm not even trying to hide it" energy.

then she wet her lips with this deliberate gesture that was absolutely dripping with innuendo, and without even bothering to turn around and look at her husband (the disrespect was astronomical), she spoke to wilson in a soft but coarse voice that somehow managed to be both intimate and dismissive at the same time:

"yo, get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down," she commanded like she was running this entire operation, giving maximum boss energy.

"oh absolutely, sure thing bestie," agreed wilson with this hurried, desperate-to-please energy, immediately scurrying toward the little office like a servant who'd been summoned. he mingled with the cement color of the walls so completely that he basically became one with the architecture—this white ashen dust that covered literally everything in this cursed location had veiled his dark suit and pale hair until he looked like a ghost of himself, a man who was slowly disappearing into the background of his own life.

the dust covered everything in the vicinity like some kind of apocalyptic snow—everything except his wife, who seemed completely immune to the environmental destruction around her and moved close to tom with this confident, predatory energy that suggested she was about to orchestrate something that would change the entire trajectory of this afternoon.

"yo, i need to see you, fr," said tom with this intense, meaningful stare that was definitely not appropriate for a man talking to another man's wife right in front of that man. "get yourself on the next train heading to the city, bestie."

"bet, absolutely," she replied without hesitation, like she'd been waiting for this exact invitation.

"i'll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level of penn station, no cap," tom said, dropping these plans like it was completely normal to plan secret meetings with someone else's spouse.

she nodded with this conspiratorial smile and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged from his office carrying two mismatched chairs like the world's saddest furniture delivery service, completely oblivious to the fact that his wife and this rich dude had just planned a rendezvous literally right in front of his face.

we waited for her down the road and out of sight, and i'm still processing the absolute audacity of what i'd just witnessed. it was a few days before the fourth of july, and this gray, scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track like he was preparing for some kind of low-budget celebration in this wasteland of despair.

"terrible place, isn't it," said tom, exchanging this meaningful frown with doctor eckleburg's omnipresent judging eyes like they were old friends bonding over the tragedy of poor people's living conditions.

"absolutely cursed, fr," i agreed, because honestly what else was there to say about this literal monument to dystopian energy and industrial decay, no cap.

"obviously, my territory control extends to helping her escape this peasant-tier environment," tom said with this fake concerned alpha energy that was really just him justifying his own power moves.

"yo, doesn't her husband have thoughts about her city trips?" i asked, because i was apparently still chronically naive enough to think normal relationship boundaries might apply in this absolutely unhinged situation.

"wilson?" tom literally laughed like this was the funniest question he'd ever heard. "bestie, that dude thinks she goes to see her sister in new york every week. he's so completely clueless he doesn't even know he's alive, let alone know what his wife is actually doing, no cap."

he said this with the kind of casual cruelty that only comes from someone who's never been told 'no' in his entire privileged existence, someone who genuinely believes that other people's feelings and relationships are just obstacles for his personal entertainment.

so tom buchanan and his side piece and i all went up to new york city together—well, not exactly together because mrs. wilson sat discretely in another train car like some kind of mistress stealth mode situation. tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those bougie east eggers who might be on the train and recognize him, because apparently even toxic alpha males care about optics when it comes to their reputations in high society, you know.

by the time we reached the city, she had completely changed her entire vibe along with her outfit. she'd switched into this brown figured muslin dress that stretched tight over her rather wide hips in a way that was giving "i'm dressed up for my sugar daddy" energy as tom helped her step onto the platform with this gallant gesture that was probably the most romantic thing that had happened in penn station all week.

at the newsstand, she went full consumer mode and bought herself a copy of town tattle (because apparently she needed to stay up to date on all the celebrity gossip) and a moving-picture magazine (for the hollywood coverage), then hit up the station drugstore to grab some cold cream and a small flask of perfume like she was preparing for a full makeover montage. the shopping spree energy was giving "someone else is paying so why not" vibes.

upstairs in the solemn echoing drive where all the taxis were waiting, she exhibited the most bougie behavior i'd ever witnessed: she literally let four different taxicabs drive away before she selected the one that met her aesthetic standards—a lavender-colored cab with gray upholstery that matched her main character energy. in this carefully chosen vehicle, we slid out from the chaos of the station into the glowing afternoon sunshine like we were making our grand entrance into the city.

but immediately she turned sharply away from the window with this sudden burst of inspiration, leaning forward to tap on the glass partition between us and the driver like she'd just remembered the most important mission of the day:

"bestie, i absolutely need to get one of those dogs," she announced with this sudden desperate earnestness like acquiring a puppy was the most important mission of her entire existence. "i need to get one for the apartment, you know? they're so nice to have around—a dog just completes the whole aesthetic, makes the place feel more like home, fr."

this was apparently the kind of spontaneous decision that people make when someone else is paying for everything and they want to live out their luxury lifestyle fantasies in real time.

we backed up to this gray old man who was giving major street vendor energy and bore this absurd resemblance to john d. rockefeller, which was either the most ironic thing i'd ever seen or the universe playing some kind of cosmic joke about capitalism. in a wicker basket that was swinging from his neck like some kind of mobile pet shop, there cowered about a dozen very recent puppies that were clearly of completely indeterminate breed—basically a whole litter of mystery dogs whose genetics were anyone's guess but whose cuteness factor was undeniable.

the old man had that hustler energy of someone who knew exactly how to work rich people who were looking for impulse purchases to make themselves feel better about their questionable life choices.

"yo, what kind of dogs are these?" asked mrs. wilson with this eager energy like she was about to make the most important purchase of her life, leaning toward the taxi window to get a better look at the merchandise, giving maximum shopper energy.

"all kinds, bestie. literally every breed imaginable," the old man replied with that practiced salesmen energy. "what kind you looking for, lady?"

"honestly, i'd love to get one of those police dogs, you know the really fierce ones? i don't suppose you got that kind of energy in that basket?"

the man peered doubtfully into his wicker basket of chaos, plunged his hand in like he was fishing for lottery tickets, and drew one puppy up by the back of the neck while it wriggled around giving maximum "help me" vibes.

"nah fam, that's definitely not a police dog," said tom with this dismissive tone that suggested he was some kind of dog breed expert.

"you right, it's not exactly what you'd call a police dog," admitted the old man with genuine disappointment in his voice, like he'd been hoping to pull off the scam of the century. "it's more of an airedale situation." he passed his weathered hand over the brown washrag texture of the puppy's back with this attempt at salesmanship. "but look at that coat though! some coat, right? that's a dog that'll never bother you with catching cold, guaranteed. premium weather resistance right there."

"oh my god, i think it's literally the cutest thing i've ever seen," said mrs. wilson with this enthusiastic energy that suggested she'd already fallen completely in love and was ready to adopt immediately. "how much are we talking for this little angel?"

"this dog right here?" he looked at the puppy admiringly like it was a priceless work of art. "this particular dog is gonna cost you exactly ten dollars. premium pricing for premium cuteness."

the airedale—and there was undoubtedly some airedale dna involved in this genetic mystery, though its startlingly white feet suggested the family tree was more complicated than anyone wanted to acknowledge—officially changed hands and settled down into mrs. wilson's lap, where she immediately started fondling its weatherproof coat with this pure rapture like she'd just been given the greatest gift in human history.

"wait, is it a boy or a girl?" she asked with this delicate curiosity that suggested gender was going to influence her bonding experience.

"oh that dog right there? that one's definitely a boy," the old man replied confidently.

"actually, it's a bitch," tom announced with this decisive alpha authority that brooked no argument, pulling out his wallet with that generational wealth energy that only trust fund legends can flex. "here's your money, pops. go secure yourself ten more premium bloodlines with this legacy cash."

we drove over to fifth avenue with this newly acquired puppy situation, and the entire vibe shifted to something warm and soft, almost pastoral, on this perfect summer sunday afternoon. the city was giving major cottagecore energy, and i genuinely wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner like we'd somehow entered a different dimension where manhattan was actually a countryside farm.

"bestie, hold up," i said, trying to escape whatever main character drama was about to unfold, "i literally have to dip from this situation. this has been... certainly an experience that's giving chaotic energy, but i should probably touch grass and head home, no cap."

"absolutely not happening, peasant," tom interjected quickly with that aggressive alpha command tone he used when asserting territory control over the entire situation. "myrtle's under my protection and she'll be genuinely hurt if you don't come up to my domain for the after-party. isn't that right, myrtle?"

"oh absolutely, you have to come up!" she urged with this conspiratorial energy, already planning the entire evening in her head. "i'm going to call my sister catherine—she's literally said to be very beautiful by people who actually know what they're talking about, and she'll definitely want to meet you. plus i've got all kinds of people i can invite over. it'll be iconic."

"well, i mean, i'd like to, but i really should—" i started to protest weakly, already knowing i was going to lose this battle.

"no buts!" she declared. "this is happening."

we continued driving, cutting back again over central park toward the west hundreds with this growing sense of inevitability that my quiet sunday afternoon was about to become something much more chaotic. at 158th street, the cab finally stopped at one slice in what looked like a long white cake of apartment buildings that were all giving identical upper middle class energy.

mrs. wilson threw this absolutely regal homecoming glance around the entire neighborhood like she was surveying her personal kingdom, gathered up her brand new puppy and all her other impulse purchases from the day, and proceeded to enter the building with this haughty, dignified energy that suggested she was about to hold court in her private palace.

"listen, i'm absolutely going to have the mckees come up from downstairs," she announced with this party planning energy as we rose in the elevator like we were ascending to some kind of exclusive social event. "they're this artsy couple who are always down for whatever. and obviously i need to call up my sister catherine too—she's going to lose her mind when she meets you, nick."

the apartment was located on the top floor, which automatically gave it premium vibes, though the actual space was giving more "cozy" than "luxury"—a small living room, small dining room, small bedroom, and one bathroom that probably required strategic scheduling if multiple people needed to use it. but myrtle had gone absolutely all out with the interior decoration situation.

it was immediately clear that this apartment functioned as myrtle's escape pod from her actual life in the valley of ashes - a carefully curated fantasy space where she could cosplay as the kind of sophisticated city woman she desperately wanted to become. every single design choice screamed "i'm not actually poor, i just live in a garage temporarily," which was honestly heartbreaking when you thought about it.

the psychological transformation that happened when myrtle entered this space was absolutely wild to witness. she went from being george wilson's defeated wife to being tom buchanan's glamorous mistress just by changing her environment, which showed how much of our identity is actually tied to the spaces we inhabit and the roles we're allowed to perform.

you could tell that myrtle had spent serious time and money creating this alternate reality for herself - probably sacrificing necessities to afford the kind of furniture and decorations that would make her feel wealthy and important. it was giving serious "fake it til you make it" energy, except she was never going to actually make it and everybody knew it except her.

the living room was crowded completely to the doors with this set of tapestried furniture that was entirely too large for the space, creating this situation where to move around was to constantly stumble over ornate scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of versailles like you were navigating through a historical reenactment that had gotten completely out of control. it was giving "i saw this in a magazine and decided i needed it" energy without considering whether it would actually fit in a normal-sized apartment.

the furniture choices revealed everything about myrtle's understanding of wealth and class - she thought rich people lived in spaces that looked like european palaces, so she'd tried to recreate that aesthetic on a working-class budget. but the result was this cramped, overwhelming environment that actually made the space feel smaller and more oppressive rather than grander.

it was honestly painful to watch someone trying so hard to transcend their circumstances through pure aesthetic performance, especially when the performance was so transparently desperate and ultimately self-defeating. the apartment was like a physical manifestation of the american dream's cruel promise that you could become anyone you wanted to be if you just tried hard enough.

the only artwork was this absolutely over-enlarged photograph that was supposed to be artistic but was honestly just confusing—at first glance it appeared to be a hen sitting on some kind of blurred rock situation, but when you looked at it from across the room, the hen somehow transformed into what looked like a bonnet, and suddenly you could make out the countenance of this stout old lady beaming down into the room with this benevolent grandmother energy that was either comforting or deeply unsettling depending on your perspective.

several old copies of town tattle were scattered across the coffee table like evidence of myrtle's dedication to staying up to date with celebrity gossip, along with a copy of "simon called peter" (which was apparently her attempt at reading something literary and respectable) and a whole collection of those small scandal magazines from broadway that were giving "i live vicariously through famous people's drama" energy.

mrs. wilson immediately focused all her attention on getting the new puppy situated like this was the most important logistical challenge of the entire day. she managed to convince the reluctant elevator boy to go fetch a cardboard box full of straw and some milk for the dog, and he added on his own initiative a tin of those large, hard dog biscuits that looked like they could break teeth—one of which immediately started decomposing apathetically in the saucer of milk like a sad cookie that had given up on life.

meanwhile, tom had already located the alcohol situation and brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau drawer with the efficiency of someone who knew exactly where the good stuff was hidden in this apartment, which raised some questions about how often he'd been here and how established this whole arrangement was.

honestly, i have been properly drunk exactly twice in my entire life, and the second time was that cursed afternoon, so literally everything that happened afterward has this dim, hazy quality like i'm remembering a fever dream or trying to recall the plot of a movie i watched while half asleep. until after eight o'clock the apartment was absolutely flooded with this cheerful sunshine that made everything feel deceptively pleasant and normal, which was probably the universe's way of luring me into a false sense of security before the chaos truly began.

the drinking started almost immediately. sitting directly on tom's lap like they were a couple who didn't need to pretend they weren't having an affair anymore, myrtle started calling up literally everyone in her contact list on the telephone, inviting them over with this hostess energy that suggested she was about to throw the party of the century in her modest apartment. after the first drink, mrs. wilson and i were suddenly on a first-name basis because apparently alcohol makes everyone best friends instantaneously.

at some point there were no cigarettes left, which became a crisis situation that required immediate resolution, so i volunteered to go out to the drugstore on the corner like the helpful guest i was trying to be. when i returned with the requested cigarettes, tom and myrtle had both mysteriously disappeared into what i assumed was the bedroom area for reasons i didn't want to contemplate too deeply.

so i sat down discreetly in the living room, trying to mind my own business, and attempted to read a chapter of "simon called peter" from myrtle's literary collection. either it was genuinely terrible writing or the whisky had already started distorting my cognitive abilities, because the words on the page were making absolutely no sense whatsoever. i kept reading the same paragraph over and over again like my brain had decided to malfunction.

just as tom and myrtle finally reappeared from whatever they'd been doing (and myrtle's hair was definitely giving "we just had a situation" energy), the doorbell started ringing and company officially commenced arriving at the apartment like this was some kind of planned social gathering rather than a spontaneous afternoon drinking session that had gotten completely out of control.

first to arrive was catherine, myrtle's sister, and she was absolutely giving that urban sophisticated energy you see in someone who's spent way too much time trying to reinvent herself for the city scene. she was this slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid, sticky bob of red hair that looked like it required daily maintenance and a complexion that had been powdered absolutely milky white in a way that was either giving porcelain doll vibes or vampire aesthetic—it was genuinely hard to tell which look she was going for.

catherine was clearly operating on that "mysterious city woman" aesthetic that you see in people who've moved to manhattan from somewhere else and decided to completely reinvent their entire personality to match what they think sophistication looks like. every aspect of her appearance seemed carefully calculated to broadcast that she was definitely not from wherever she'd originally come from.

her whole vibe was giving serious "i know things about the underground scene that you couldn't even imagine" energy - she had that conspiratorial air of someone who collected gossip and urban legends like other people collected stamps, and was always ready to share the latest rumor or scandal with anyone who would listen.

her eyebrows had clearly been plucked completely off and then drawn back on again at this more rakish angle that was supposed to look edgy and sophisticated, but nature kept trying to restore the original alignment, which gave her entire face this blurred, slightly smudged quality like someone had tried to photoshop her features in real life but hadn't quite mastered the software.

the makeup situation was honestly impressive in its commitment to artificiality - she'd clearly spent serious time and effort creating this look that was supposed to suggest she was too cool and mysterious to care about conventional beauty standards, but the amount of work involved in looking that effortlessly edgy was actually kind of exhausting to witness.

when she moved around the apartment, there was this absolutely incessant clicking sound as literally innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down her arms like she was wearing a percussion instrument as an accessory. the jewelry choices were giving serious "i buy all my accessories from street vendors who tell me they're authentic artifacts from exotic locations" energy.

you could tell that catherine was the type of person who had opinions about everything and wasn't shy about sharing them, especially if those opinions made her seem more worldly and connected than everyone else in the room. she had that specific energy of someone who reads conspiracy theory forums and thinks that makes her more informed than people who get their news from conventional sources.

she came bursting into the apartment with such proprietary haste and immediately started looking around so possessively at all the furniture that for a hot second i genuinely wondered if she actually lived here too and myrtle had somehow failed to mention that this was a sister roommate situation. but when i asked her about it, she laughed with this absolutely immoderate energy, repeated my question out loud to the entire room like it was the funniest thing she'd ever heard, and informed everyone that she actually lived with a girlfriend at some hotel downtown, which raised about a dozen questions i wasn't going to ask.

right behind her came mr. mckee, who was this pale, feminine man from the apartment directly below who was giving major "i haven't seen sunlight in months" energy. he had literally just finished shaving—there was still this white spot of dried lather on his cheekbone that everyone was pretending not to notice—and he was being incredibly respectful in his greetings to everyone in the room with this nervous politeness that suggested he didn't get invited to parties very often and was determined not to mess up this social opportunity.

he immediately informed me that he was "in the artistic game," which was apparently his way of saying he was a photographer, and i put two and two together and realized he was responsible for that absolutely cursed enlargement of mrs. wilson's mother that was hovering on the wall like some kind of ectoplasm from a horror movie. his artistic vision was... questionable at best.

his wife, who had followed him in, was this study in contrasts—simultaneously shrill and languid, handsome and horrible, like she couldn't decide which personality to commit to for the evening. she immediately cornered me and told me with genuine pride that her husband had photographed her exactly one hundred and twenty-seven times since they'd been married, which was either incredibly romantic or deeply concerning depending on how you looked at it. i was leaning toward concerning, especially given the quality of his work on display.

at some point during the evening's chaos, myrtle had completely changed her entire costume and was now giving full main character energy in this elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon that was clearly expensive as hell and made this continual rustling sound every time she moved, like she was announcing her presence with built-in sound effects as she swept dramatically around the room like she was performing in her own personal reality show.

with the influence of this premium outfit, her entire personality had also undergone this absolutely wild transformation that was giving full "i'm now too good for everyone" energy. the intense, raw vitality that had been so remarkable back in the garage—that authentic, desperate energy—was now completely converted into this impressive hauteur that was part wannabe socialite, part mob wife, and entirely performative. she was serving looks and attitude in equal measure.

her laughter became more violently affected with each passing moment, her gestures grew increasingly dramatic and theatrical, and every single assertion she made was delivered with this over-the-top confidence that suggested she was the most important person who had ever existed. as she expanded into this new persona, the entire room seemed to grow smaller around her, until she appeared to be revolving on this noisy, creaking pivot through the increasingly smoky air like she was the sun and everyone else was just orbiting around her magnificent presence. she was absolutely in her mob wife era, and she wanted everyone to know it.

"my dear sister," she announced to catherine in this high, mincing shout that was designed to sound sophisticated but was really just loud and affected, "let me tell you something about these men—most of these fellas will literally cheat you every single time, no cap. all they ever think about is money, money, money. like, i had this woman come up here just last week to look at my feet for some pedicure situation, and when she handed me the bill, bestie, you would have thought she had performed my entire appendicitis surgery instead of just trimming some toenails."

"wait, what was the actual name of this woman?" asked mrs. mckee with this gossipy energy like she was about to compile a mental list of service providers to avoid.

"mrs. eberhardt," myrtle replied with this dramatic flair. "she literally goes around looking at people's feet in their own homes like some kind of foot inspector. the audacity was astronomical."

"oh my god, i absolutely love your dress though," remarked mrs. mckee, clearly trying to change the subject to something more pleasant. "i think it's literally adorable, like where did you even get it?"

but mrs. wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in this disdainful way that suggested accepting praise would be beneath her new sophisticated persona.

"honestly, it's just some crazy old thing i had lying around," she said with this fake casual energy that was clearly performative humility. "i literally just slip it on sometimes when i don't even care what i look like. it's nothing special, really."

"but no, seriously, it looks absolutely wonderful on you, if you know what i mean," pursued mrs. mckee with this increasing enthusiasm. "like, if chester could only get you posed exactly like that, i genuinely think he could make something really artistic out of it. you have such interesting features."

we all looked in this expectant silence at mrs. wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes with this practiced gesture and looked back at us with this absolutely brilliant smile that was equal parts genuine pleasure and calculated performance, like she was posing for an invisible camera.

mr. mckee regarded her with this intense artistic concentration, tilting his head to one side like he was examining a sculpture in a museum, then started moving his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face like he was framing the shot or trying to capture the perfect lighting conditions.

"you know what, i should probably change the light situation," he announced after a moment of this careful consideration. "i'd really like to bring out the modeling of your facial features better. and honestly, i'd want to try to get hold of all that back hair and arrange it differently for maximum impact."

"no way, i wouldn't even think of changing the light," cried mrs. mckee with this sudden passionate energy. "i think the lighting right now is absolutely perfect and—"

but her husband immediately shushed her with this authoritative "sh!" gesture, and we all obediently turned to look at the subject again with this renewed artistic attention, whereupon tom buchanan let out this incredibly audible yawn and got to his feet with the energy of someone who was already bored with the entire artistic consultation process.

"yo, you mckees need to get yourselves something to drink," tom announced with this casual command energy, like he was hosting the party in someone else's apartment. "and myrtle, bestie, we definitely need some more ice and mineral water before literally everyone in this room passes out from dehydration."

"ugh, i already told that elevator boy about the ice situation earlier," myrtle replied, raising her eyebrows in this dramatic despair at what she perceived as the complete shiftlessness of the lower social orders. "honestly, these people! you literally have to keep after them all the time or nothing gets done. the service industry is absolutely falling apart."

she looked directly at me and let out this completely pointless laugh like we were sharing some kind of inside joke, then flounced over to where the new puppy was situated, kissed it with this absolutely ecstatic energy like she was reuniting with a long-lost family member, and then swept dramatically into the kitchen with this grand gesture that implied she had approximately a dozen professional chefs just waiting there to carry out her sophisticated orders.

meanwhile, mr. mckee was trying to insert himself into the conversation with this nervous artistic energy. "you know, i've actually done some really nice photographic work out on long island," he asserted with this hopeful tone that suggested he was desperately trying to impress someone, anyone, with his professional accomplishments.

the dude was clearly recognizing that tom represented exactly the kind of wealthy social connection that could transform his struggling artistic career, and he was willing to embarrass himself in pursuit of that opportunity. it was honestly painful to watch someone debase themselves so obviously for the chance at upward mobility.

mckee's whole approach was giving serious "starving artist meets potential patron" energy - you could see him calculating how to position himself as valuable to tom without seeming too desperate, but he was failing spectacularly because his desperation was written all over his face.

tom looked at him with this absolutely blank expression like he had no idea what this man was talking about or why he should care about his photography hobby. the power dynamic was brutal to witness - tom held all the cards and clearly enjoyed watching mckee grovel for his attention and approval.

"we actually have two of my best pieces framed and hanging downstairs in our apartment," mckee continued hopefully, apparently not reading tom's complete lack of interest as the massive red flag it obviously was.

the fact that mckee thought his amateur photography would impress someone like tom showed how little he understood about how wealth and social status actually worked. tom wasn't interested in art or culture - he was interested in power and dominance, and mckee's artistic pretensions probably just made him seem more pathetic.

"two what exactly?" tom demanded with this aggressively dismissive alpha energy, making it clear this beta behavior wasn't worth his superior attention. he was basically toying with mckee at this point, amusing himself by watching this desperate man try to sell himself.

"two artistic studies," mckee explained with growing enthusiasm that was completely oblivious to tom's obvious lack of interest. "one of them i call 'montauk point—the gulls' and the other one i call 'montauk point—the sea.' they're part of a whole series i'm working on about capturing the essence of long island's natural beauty."

the titles alone were giving maximum pretentious art student energy - like he thought adding poetic names to basic landscape photography would somehow elevate them to fine art status. meanwhile, tom was probably calculating exactly how much he could humiliate this man before it stopped being entertaining.

at this point, catherine, myrtle's sister, decided to abandon whatever conversation she'd been having and came over to sit down beside me on the couch with this conspiratorial energy that suggested she was about to share some absolutely critical information.

"wait, do you actually live down on long island too?" she inquired with this genuine curiosity that suggested she was always trying to map out people's living situations for future gossip purposes.

"yeah, i live at west egg," i replied, not really thinking much about it.

"no way, really?" she said with this sudden burst of excitement. "i was literally down there at this absolutely insane party about a month ago. it was at some rich guy's house—this man named gatsby. do you know him?"

"oh shit, i actually live right next door to him," i said, suddenly realizing this conversation was about to get very interesting.

"no fucking way," she said, her eyes going wide with this mix of excitement and fear. "well, okay, so like, everyone's saying he's supposedly a nephew or a cousin of kaiser wilhelm. you know, the german emperor? that's literally where all his money comes from according to the rumors. it's giving nepo baby conspiracy theory energy but make it international war criminal edition."

"wait, seriously?" i asked, because this was definitely not the kind of backstory i'd been expecting about my mysterious neighbor.

she nodded with this very serious energy, like she was sharing classified government information.

"honestly, i'm lowkey scared of him," she continued, lowering her voice to this conspiratorial whisper. "like, i would absolutely hate to have him get anything on me, you know? he seems like the type of person who collects secrets about people and then uses them when convenient. it's giving mob boss energy but with better parties."

this absolutely absorbing information about my neighbor was suddenly interrupted by mrs. mckee, who was apparently still in full artistic consultation mode and pointed suddenly at catherine with this burst of inspiration:

"oh my god, chester, i genuinely think you could do something really artistic with her," she broke out with this enthusiastic energy, like she'd just discovered the next great photographic subject. but mr. mckee only nodded in this completely bored, disinterested way and immediately turned his attention back to tom like catherine wasn't even worth considering as a potential model.

"honestly, i'd really like to do more professional photography work on long island if i could somehow get the entry into those social circles," mckee continued with this hopeful, networking energy. "all i'm asking for is that someone should give me a start, you know? just one good connection to get my foot in the door."

mckee's desperation was honestly heartbreaking to witness - you could tell he'd probably spent years trying to break into the kind of wealthy social circles that could afford to commission artistic photography, but he was trapped in this loop where he needed connections to get work and needed work to make connections.

"yo, ask myrtle about that," said tom, breaking into this short shout of laughter as mrs. wilson made her grand reentrance carrying a tray like she was serving at some bougie cocktail party. "she'll definitely give you a letter of introduction to all the right people, won't you myrtle? she's got connections."

there was something absolutely sinister about the way tom's brain worked - he'd immediately identified an opportunity to humiliate both myrtle and mckee simultaneously while positioning himself as the puppet master controlling everyone's social interactions. it was giving serious sadistic entertainment energy.

"sorry, do what now?" myrtle asked with this startled energy like she'd been caught completely off guard by being volunteered for something. you could see her trying to figure out whether this was an opportunity to demonstrate her social importance or a trap designed to remind her of her actual circumstances.

"you'll give our friend mckee here a letter of introduction to your husband george," tom explained with this cruel amusement, "so he can go do some artistic studies of him in his natural habitat. you know, 'george b. wilson at the gasoline pump,' or 'portrait of a man slowly dying inside,' something with that kind of aesthetic."

the suggestion was obviously meant to be humiliating, and everyone could feel the toxic energy radiating from tom's casual cruelty. he was basically forcing myrtle to choose between acknowledging her actual marriage and social circumstances or continuing to pretend she was too sophisticated to be associated with a garage owner.

meanwhile, mckee was apparently so desperate for any kind of professional opportunity that he was actually considering this deliberately insulting proposal, which showed how thoroughly his artistic ambitions had been corrupted by financial desperation. watching him try to figure out if this was a real offer or just elaborate mockery was honestly painful.

tom was clearly enjoying the power dynamics he'd created - he could humiliate poor people for entertainment while also dangling false hope in front of them, all while maintaining his position as the wealthy benefactor who held everyone's fate in his hands. it was honestly sick to witness someone derive that much pleasure from other people's vulnerability.

the whole exchange perfectly demonstrated how casual cruelty functioned in tom's world - he could destroy people's dignity and self-respect just for fun, and they would thank him for the attention because they were so desperate for any connection to wealth and status.

catherine leaned close to me at this point and whispered directly in my ear with this gossipy, conspiratorial energy:

"just so you know, literally neither of them can stand the person they're actually married to. like, at all."

"wait, they can't?" i whispered back, because this seemed like important relationship intel.

"absolutely cannot stand them," she confirmed, glancing meaningfully at myrtle and then at tom. "like, what i always say is, why the hell would you go on living with someone if you literally can't stand them? if i was in their situation, i'd get a divorce immediately and just get married to each other right away. problem solved."

"hold up, so myrtle doesn't like wilson either?" i asked, because this seemed like it would be relevant information.

the answer to this question was absolutely unexpected and came from myrtle herself, who had apparently overheard our whispered conversation. she launched into this completely violent and obscene tirade about her husband that was so aggressive and detailed that everyone in the room just stopped talking and stared at her with this mix of shock and fascination.

"you see what i mean?" cried catherine triumphantly after myrtle had finished her rant, like she'd just proven her point beyond any doubt. she immediately lowered her voice again to continue the gossip session. "but here's the real tea—it's actually tom's wife that's keeping them apart from being together officially. she's apparently a catholic, and you know they don't believe in divorce under any circumstances."

but i knew for a fact that daisy was definitely not a catholic, and i was genuinely a little shocked at the absolute elaborateness of this lie that catherine was spreading around like gospel truth. the audacity of the whole deception was honestly something to behold.

"so anyway, when they finally do get married," catherine continued with this confident energy like she was planning their entire future, "they're apparently going to go west to live for a while until all the drama blows over and people stop talking about it."

"lowkey, it would probably be way more discrete if they just went to europe instead," i suggested, because that was giving better long-distance relationship drama management vibes than this whole situation.

"oh my god, do you actually like europe?" she exclaimed with this sudden burst of excitement, like i'd just revealed that we had this amazing shared interest. "no way, i literally just got back from monte carlo!"

"wait, seriously?" i said, because that seemed like a very expensive and glamorous trip for someone who lived in a hotel with a girlfriend.

"yeah, just last year actually," she said with this proud energy. "i went over there with this other girl i know. it was supposed to be this whole luxurious european adventure situation."

"did you guys stay long?" i asked, genuinely curious about how this had all worked out.

"no, unfortunately we literally just went to monte carlo and back," she said with this slight disappointment in her voice. "we went by way of marseilles because someone told us that was the most scenic route. and listen to this—we had over twelve hundred dollars when we started the trip, which seemed like so much money, but we got absolutely gypped out of literally all of it in just two days in those private gambling rooms. it was honestly a disaster."

she paused dramatically to let the full tragedy of the financial loss sink in.

"we had such an awful time trying to get back home, i can't even tell you," she continued with this mix of embarrassment and lingering outrage. "we basically had to beg and borrow our way back to new york. god, how i absolutely hated that entire town by the time we left! never again."

for a moment, the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window with this beautiful golden light that reminded me of what she was describing—like the blue honey of the mediterranean filtering through the apartment and making everything seem magical and far away. but then the absolutely shrill voice of mrs. mckee suddenly called me back into the immediate reality of this increasingly chaotic party situation.

"you know what, i almost made a terrible mistake too," mrs. mckee declared with this vigorous energy, like catherine's story had reminded her of her own near-disaster. "i literally almost married this little jewelry main who'd been chasing after me for years. i always knew he was completely below my standards. everybody kept saying to me constantly: 'lucille, that man is way below you! don't settle!' but honestly, if i hadn't met chester when i did, that guy definitely would have worn me down eventually." she paused with this dramatic flair.

"yes, but listen though," said myrtle wilson, nodding her head up and down with this knowing energy, "at least you didn't actually go through with marrying him. that's the key difference."

"you're absolutely right, i definitely didn't," mrs. mckee agreed with this satisfied tone.

"well, i actually did marry mine," said myrtle with this ambiguous energy that was part regret, part defiance. "and that's literally the entire difference between your case and mine. you got to dodge the bullet. i took it straight to the face."

"but wait, why did you even do it, myrtle?" demanded catherine with this mix of genuine curiosity and sisterly concern. "like, nobody literally forced you to marry him. you had a choice."

myrtle took this long moment to consider the question, like she was really thinking deeply about her past decision-making process and trying to articulate something complicated.

"honestly, i married him because i thought he was a gentleman," she said finally with this tone of genuine disappointment. "i thought he actually knew something about breeding and class and how to conduct himself properly. but it turned out he wasn't even fit to lick my shoe, let alone be married to me."

"but come on, you were absolutely crazy about him for a while though, right?" said catherine, pressing for more details. "at the beginning?"

"crazy about him?!" cried myrtle with this absolutely incredulous energy, like catherine had just suggested the most ridiculous thing she'd ever heard. "who the hell said i was ever crazy about him? i was literally never any more crazy about that man than i am about... that guy right there."

and then she pointed suddenly and dramatically at me, and literally everyone in the entire room turned to look at me with these accusatory stares like i'd somehow done something wrong just by existing in this space. i tried to communicate through my facial expression that i expected absolutely no romantic affection from anyone and was just an innocent bystander who'd gotten dragged into this situation against his will.

"the only 'crazy' i ever was, was crazy enough to marry him in the first place," myrtle continued with this building outrage. "i knew literally right away that i had made a huge mistake. you want to know how i found out what kind of man he really was? he borrowed somebody else's best suit to get married in—didn't even own his own wedding outfit—and never bothered to tell me about it. then one day when he was out, the actual owner of the suit shows up at our door looking for it. 'oh, is that your suit?' i said when this stranger explained the situation. 'this is literally the first time i'm hearing about any of this.' but i had to give it back to him obviously, and then i went inside and lay down on the bed and cried to beat the band for the entire rest of the afternoon."

the story was genuinely heartbreaking in its specific, humiliating details.

"she really absolutely ought to get away from him," catherine resumed, turning to address me directly like i was supposed to have opinions about this whole situation. "they've been living over that cursed garage for eleven whole years. and tom is literally the first sweetie she's ever had who treats her with any kind of respect or gives her nice things."

by this point, the bottle of whisky—and we were definitely on a second one now—had become this constantly circulating necessity that literally everyone present was hitting except for catherine, who kept insisting that she "felt just as good on nothing at all," which honestly seemed impossible given the energy levels everyone else was maintaining through pure alcohol consumption.

tom rang for the building's janitor with this casual rich person authority and sent him on a mission to acquire some celebrated sandwiches from somewhere in the neighborhood, which were apparently substantial enough to constitute a complete supper by themselves. the man just expected other people to handle his food procurement needs like he was royalty.

at this point i was genuinely starting to feel trapped in this increasingly chaotic situation and desperately wanted to extract myself and walk eastward toward central park through what i could see was becoming a really beautiful soft twilight outside the window. but literally every single time i tried to make moves toward leaving, i somehow became entangled in some new wild, strident argument that pulled me back into my chair as if there were invisible ropes connecting me to this apartment and these people and their drama.

the whole situation was getting surreal. looking out the window, i could see our line of yellow-lit windows from the outside perspective, and i realized we must have been contributing our own share of human secrecy and private chaos to any casual watcher who might be looking up from the darkening streets below, wondering what kinds of stories were playing out behind all these glowing rectangles scattered across the city's apartment buildings.

i felt like i was simultaneously inside this experience—fully participating in the drunken conversation and witnessing all the interpersonal drama—and completely outside of it, observing the entire scene like an anthropologist studying some fascinating but deeply concerning social phenomenon. i was enchanted by the absolute inexhaustible variety of human behavior i was witnessing, but also genuinely repelled by how toxic and messy it all was.

and that's when myrtle decided to make the entire situation even more uncomfortably intimate by pulling her chair directly close to mine, so close that her warm breath was literally pouring over me as she launched into what was apparently going to be the complete story of her first meeting with tom buchanan.

"okay, so picture this," she began with this dreamy, romantic energy that was clearly her favorite story to tell. "it was on those two little seats facing each other that are literally always the last ones left empty on the train—you know, the ones nobody wants because you have to stare directly at a stranger the whole ride. i was going up to new york to see my sister catherine and spend the night, just a regular boring trip, nothing special planned."

she paused for dramatic effect, making sure everyone was paying attention to her origin story.

"and then i see this man get on the train, and bestie, he had on this absolutely gorgeous dress suit and these patent leather shoes that were clearly expensive as hell, and i literally could not keep my eyes off him. he was giving main character energy from the second he walked into that train car. but every time he looked at me—and he was definitely looking—i had to pretend to be studying the advertisement over his head like it was the most fascinating thing i'd ever seen."

myrtle was getting increasingly animated as she relived this memory, her hands gesturing dramatically.

"so when we finally came into penn station, somehow he ended up right next to me in the crowd—like fate or whatever—and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and i could smell his cologne, and i was so flustered that i actually told him i'd have to call a policeman if he didn't give me some space. but the thing is, he absolutely knew i was lying through my teeth. the chemistry was obvious."

listening to myrtle tell this story, you could see how this memory had become the foundational myth of her entire identity transformation. this was the moment when her fantasy of escaping the valley of ashes had seemed like it might actually be possible, and she'd been retelling it to herself ever since to justify everything that followed.

she giggled at this point with genuine delight at her own story, but there was also something desperate about the way she clung to these details - tom's cologne, his white shirtfront, the feeling of being chosen by someone wealthy and sophisticated. it was like she was trying to convince herself as much as her audience that this had been a genuine romantic encounter rather than a calculated seduction.

"i was honestly so excited and overwhelmed by this whole interaction that when he suggested we share a taxi, i got into the car with him and literally didn't even realize i wasn't getting into a subway train. my brain was completely short-circuiting. and the entire ride, all i kept thinking about, over and over again, was 'you can't live forever, you can't live forever'—basically yolo energy, you know? like, this might be my one chance at something exciting and different."

the repetition of "you can't live forever" was honestly heartbreaking because it revealed the fundamental desperation that had driven myrtle's decision. she'd been so starved for any kind of excitement or possibility in her life that she'd been willing to risk everything for what was essentially a stranger's attention.

what myrtle didn't seem to understand, even now, was that tom had probably been using that exact same approach on vulnerable women for years. the calculated charm, the expensive appearance, the suggestion of shared intimacy - it was clearly a practiced routine designed to exploit women who were desperate for something better than their current circumstances.

the story also revealed how completely myrtle had misread the nature of her relationship with tom from the very beginning. she thought she'd been chosen for something special, when really she'd just been convenient and available. and the tragedy was that she was still operating under that original delusion, even though tom's true character had been revealed countless times since then.

watching her tell this story with such obvious pleasure and nostalgia, despite everything that had happened since, showed how powerful the fantasy of transformation could be. myrtle would rather live in a reality where she was tom's chosen companion than acknowledge that she was just his temporary entertainment, because the alternative was admitting that she was trapped in exactly the same life she'd been trying to escape.

she turned to mrs. mckee at this point and the entire room literally rang full of her artificial laughter, this performative sound that was designed to make everyone understand how charming and spontaneous she was.

"listen, my dear," she suddenly announced to mrs. mckee with this burst of generous energy, "i'm literally going to give you this entire dress as soon as i'm through wearing it tonight. i've already decided i need to get myself another one tomorrow anyway. actually, i should probably make a whole list of all the things i need to acquire."

she started ticking off items on her fingers with this manic shopping energy:

"a massage and a wave for my hair, and a collar for the new dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring and it opens up automatically, and a wreath with a black silk bow for my mother's grave that'll last the entire summer. honestly, i need to write all this down so i won't forget everything i'm supposed to do."

the whole monologue was giving maximum chaotic to-do list energy, like she was trying to purchase her way into a completely different life.

at some point i noticed it was nine o'clock, and then almost immediately afterward i looked at my watch again and discovered it was somehow already ten—time was moving in this weird, alcohol-distorted way where hours just evaporated without explanation. mr. mckee had completely passed out in his chair and was sitting there with his fists clenched in his lap like some kind of photograph of a man of action, except he was unconscious and drooling slightly.

taking out my handkerchief, i finally dealt with the spot of dried shaving lather that had been stuck on his cheekbone and bothering me literally all afternoon. it was such a small act of kindness in this increasingly chaotic environment.

the poor little dog was still sitting on the table, looking around with these blind, confused eyes through all the cigarette smoke that now filled the entire apartment, and every few minutes it would let out these faint groaning sounds like it was as overwhelmed by the social situation as i was.

the party had devolved into this surreal social chaos where people kept disappearing into different rooms, reappearing with different energy, making elaborate plans to go somewhere else, and then immediately losing each other and having to search around the crowded apartment to find each other again, only to discover they'd been standing literally a few feet away the entire time.

the whole scene was like watching a social experiment about how alcohol and confined spaces could turn rational adults into absolute chaos gremlins. everyone was operating on this strange logic where their next brilliant idea was always just around the corner, but they kept getting distracted by new conversations and forgetting what they'd been planning to do.

myrtle had transformed into this manic hostess energy, floating between groups and inserting herself into every conversation like she was the main character of her own reality show. meanwhile, tom was getting increasingly aggressive and possessive, making pointed comments about people's backgrounds and social status that everyone was pretending not to notice.

catherine was in full conspiracy theory mode, sharing increasingly wild stories about various people she claimed to know, each one more dramatic and unbelievable than the last. meanwhile, the mckees were trying to position themselves as the sophisticated cultural observers of the group, but really they were just as drunk and messy as everyone else.

the poor puppy had become this tragic mascot of the entire party - sitting there looking overwhelmed and confused while adults behaved like children around it, occasionally remembering to give it attention but mostly using it as a prop for their performances of domestic sophistication.

watching everyone perform these exaggerated versions of themselves was honestly exhausting. it was like being trapped in a room where everyone had decided to become a caricature of what they thought impressive adults were supposed to act like, but none of them were actually pulling it off convincingly.

the apartment itself seemed to be groaning under the weight of all this artificial sophistication - the too-large furniture was making everything feel cramped and chaotic, and the decorative elements that myrtle was so proud of were just highlighting how desperate the whole performance really was.

you could feel the tension building throughout the evening as people got drunker and more reckless with their social boundaries. conversations that had started as polite small talk were turning into increasingly personal confessions and aggressive confrontations, and everyone was getting bolder about saying things they'd normally keep to themselves.

it was becoming clear that this kind of party was basically a pressure cooker for all the social resentments and class anxieties that people normally tried to suppress. alcohol was just the catalyst that allowed everyone's true feelings about wealth, status, and social hierarchy to come bubbling up to the surface in increasingly toxic ways.

sometime around midnight, the tension that had been building all evening finally exploded when tom buchanan and mrs. wilson ended up standing face to face in the middle of the living room, discussing in increasingly impassioned voices whether or not mrs. wilson had any right to mention daisy's name in this apartment.

the confrontation had been brewing for hours - you could feel the toxic energy building as tom got increasingly drunk and possessive, and myrtle got increasingly bold and reckless with alcohol giving her courage to push boundaries that she normally respected out of fear. it was like watching a car accident in slow motion, where you can see exactly what's going to happen but feel powerless to prevent it.

myrtle had clearly been testing tom's limits all evening, making increasingly provocative comments and behaviors that she knew would irritate him, but she was drunk enough to think she could get away with it. meanwhile, tom was getting that specific kind of angry that rich men get when poor people forget their place and start acting like they have rights.

the argument itself was honestly heartbreaking to witness - myrtle desperately asserting her right to exist as a full human being with opinions and desires, while tom was basically reminding her that she was just property he could dispose of whenever he felt like it. the power dynamics were absolutely brutal to watch play out in real time.

"daisy! daisy! daisy!" myrtle shouted with this defiant, almost manic energy. "i'll say her name whenever i fucking want to! daisy! daisy! dai—"

there was something genuinely heroic about myrtle's refusal to be silenced, even though everyone in the room could see that she was pushing tom past the point of tolerating her rebellion. she was basically choosing to assert her dignity even though she knew it was going to cost her, which showed a kind of courage that was both admirable and absolutely terrifying.

but she never got to finish the word, because tom made this short, deft movement and broke her nose with his open hand in one brutal motion. apparently one does not simply say the forbidden name. the violence was so sudden and casual that for a moment nobody reacted - it was like watching someone swat a fly, except the fly was a human being with feelings and dreams.

immediately there was absolute chaos—bloody towels scattered across the bathroom floor, women's voices scolding and crying, and rising high over all the confusion, this long, broken wail of pain that seemed to fill the entire apartment. mr. mckee jolted awake from his unconscious state and started stumbling in a daze toward the door like he wanted to escape this nightmare situation.

when he'd gotten about halfway to the exit, he turned around to stare back at the scene with these confused, horrified eyes—his wife and catherine were both scolding tom and trying to console myrtle at the same time, stumbling around among all the crowded furniture with towels and first aid supplies, while the despairing figure on the couch bled profusely and tried to spread a copy of town tattle over the tapestry scenes of versailles like she was trying to hide from the world.

mr. mckee took one more look at this absolute disaster, then turned and continued on out the door with the energy of someone who'd seen enough violence for one lifetime.

taking my hat from where it had ended up hanging on the chandelier somehow, i immediately followed him toward the exit, desperate to escape this increasingly toxic environment.

"hey, you should come to lunch with me some day," he suggested as we groaned down together in the building's ancient elevator, both of us trying to process what we'd just witnessed.

"yo, where would we even go though?" i asked, though honestly i was just making conversation to avoid processing the absolutely unhinged violence that had just occurred.

"anywhere that's not here," he replied, which seemed reasonable.

"yo, keep your hands off the elevator lever," snapped the elevator boy with obvious annoyance at our drunk passenger behavior.

"oh, i beg your pardon," said mr. mckee with this attempt at dignity despite his obvious intoxication. "i genuinely didn't know i was touching it."

"sure, sounds good," i agreed about the lunch plan, though i knew neither of us would probably remember this conversation in the morning. "i'll definitely be glad to do that."

there was this weird time jump where somehow i ended up standing beside his bed while he was sitting up between the sheets, wearing only his underwear and holding this large photography portfolio in his hands.

"beauty and the beast... loneliness... old grocery horse... brooklyn bridge..." he was muttering, flipping through his artistic work with this serious film bro energy like he was curating an exhibition.

and then somehow, through the magic of alcohol-induced time distortion, i found myself lying half asleep on this absolutely uncomfortable bench in the cold, echoing lower level of pennsylvania station, staring blankly at the morning tribune newspaper that someone had left behind, waiting for the 4 o'clock train back to west egg and desperately trying to piece together the absolutely chaotic sequence of events that had somehow become my entire weekend.

the transition from being inside that suffocating apartment to finding myself alone in this massive, empty train station felt completely surreal - like i'd been transported between two different dimensions of urban existence. the silence was almost more overwhelming than the chaos had been, leaving me with nothing but my own thoughts and the persistent ringing in my ears from hours of shouting and confusion.

the fluorescent lights were giving me a headache, the concrete was freezing against my back, and i kept replaying the evening's events like some kind of traumatic slideshow: the valley of ashes and its omnipresent judging eyes, george wilson's defeated energy, myrtle's desperate transformation from garage wife to apartment party queen, tom's casual cruelty and toxic masculinity, catherine's conspiracy theories about gatsby, the mckees and their tragic artistic pretensions, and finally that horrible moment of violence that had shattered the whole artificial party atmosphere.

every time i tried to close my eyes, i would see myrtle's face in that moment right before tom hit her - the defiant courage mixed with desperate vulnerability, the way she'd chosen to assert her humanity even though she knew it would cost her. the image was seared into my brain like a photograph i couldn't stop looking at.

i felt like i'd been given this intensive crash course in how the other half lives—the messy, desperate, violent reality that exists just beneath the surface of all those glittering parties and sophisticated conversations that i'd thought represented some kind of glamorous adult life. but it wasn't glamorous at all. it was just sad and toxic and ultimately destructive.

the whole evening had been this perfectly orchestrated demonstration of how wealth and power actually function in america - not through sophisticated debates or elegant negotiations, but through raw intimidation and the threat of violence. tom had been able to destroy myrtle's dignity and safety with one casual gesture, and everyone just accepted it as normal because that's how the system works.

lying there in the train station, surrounded by the morning commuters who were beginning their normal, productive days, i realized i'd witnessed something genuinely dark about human nature and the american dream. myrtle wilson wanted to escape her circumstances so desperately that she was willing to destroy her marriage and her dignity for the chance to play dress-up in someone else's apartment. tom buchanan was so secure in his privilege that he could literally break someone's face and just walk away without consequences. and i'd been complicit in all of it, just by being there and not doing anything to stop it.

the guilt was honestly overwhelming - i kept thinking about how i could have intervened, how i could have said something or done something to prevent what happened. but the truth was that i'd been so paralyzed by the social dynamics and my own discomfort that i'd basically just watched everything unfold like it was entertainment rather than real people's lives being destroyed.

what bothered me most was realizing how easily i'd been swept up in the whole performance. for a few hours, i'd genuinely enjoyed the chaos and drama, feeling sophisticated and worldly for being included in this adult world of affairs and parties and casual cruelty. but that made me complicit in a system that treated people like myrtle as disposable entertainment for the wealthy.

the whole experience had left me feeling simultaneously enlightened and completely exhausted—like i'd learned something important about the world that i wasn't sure i actually wanted to know. i understood now that the glamorous adult life i'd been fantasizing about was built on a foundation of exploitation and violence, and that understanding was going to be impossible to forget.

sitting there in the harsh fluorescent lighting, waiting for a train that would take me back to my comfortable middle-class existence, i realized that i was forever changed by what i'd witnessed. i could never again look at wealth and privilege without seeing the human cost, never again enjoy sophisticated parties without wondering who was being crushed to make them possible.

the american dream that had brought me to new york - the promise that hard work and ambition could lead to prosperity and happiness - had been revealed as a cruel joke that mostly served to justify the suffering of people like george and myrtle wilson. and the worst part was that i was now part of that system, whether i wanted to be or not.

i kept thinking about dr. eckleburg's eyes, watching over that entire wasteland with their faded blue judgment, and wondering if they had witnessed what happened tonight. did those painted eyes see everything - the desperation, the violence, the casual cruelty that wealth made possible? were they keeping some kind of cosmic scorecard of all the human suffering that passed beneath their surveillance?

the valley of ashes suddenly seemed less like a geographical location and more like a metaphor for the moral wasteland that existed in the spaces between the wealthy and the poor. people like myrtle and george were trapped there, ground down by forces they couldn't control or even fully understand, while people like tom moved through their lives like destructive weather systems - powerful, unpredictable, and completely indifferent to the damage they left behind.

what bothered me most was realizing that i had been complicit in that destruction just by being present and doing nothing to stop it. i had watched myrtle transform herself into something she thought tom wanted, watched her perform this elaborate fantasy of sophistication and wealth, and i had said nothing when it became clear that the performance was doomed to end in violence and humiliation.

the whole experience had shown me how thin the veneer of civilization really was, especially when alcohol and social tensions were involved. underneath all the sophisticated conversation and expensive clothes, we were still just animals competing for resources and status, and the rules of that competition were written by whoever had the most power.

i understood now why people like gatsby threw such elaborate parties - they were trying to create spaces where the normal rules of society didn't apply, where transformation might actually be possible. but tonight had shown me that those spaces were just as dangerous as anywhere else, maybe more so because they encouraged people to believe in possibilities that would ultimately destroy them.

the train that would take me back to west egg was still hours away, and i had nothing to do but sit there and process the fact that my education in the realities of american society had just taken a very dark and violent turn. whatever innocence i'd brought with me to new york was gone forever, replaced by a cynical understanding of how power really worked in this country.

it had been the absolute end of a very, very long day, and honestly, i wasn't sure if i was the same person who had gotten on that train with tom buchanan what felt like a lifetime ago. but i was certain that nick carraway - whoever he was now - would never again be naive enough to think that wealth and sophistication automatically meant civilization and moral progress.
