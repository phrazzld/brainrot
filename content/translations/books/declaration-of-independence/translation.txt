*** start of the project gutenberg ebook the declaration of independence of the united states of america ***  
   
===========================================================  
   
note fam: dis file be a mashup of the first two project gutenberg files (both got that filenumber #1 LOL) and there’s duplicate vibes around here – a few updates through the years fr fr. all the OG files are chillin in the "old" subdirectory, accessible under the "more files" listing in the pg catalog, so don’t worry if you’re caught in 4k with our headers – they’re lit and here to stay, deadass.  
   
===========================================================  
   
**welcome to the world of free plain vanilla electronic texts (mfw free bae)**  
   
**etexts readable by both humans and computers since 1971 (yeet both)**  
   
*these etexts were prepped by hundreds of volunteer legends and donation heroes – big loves fam*  
   
below you’ll find the first nine project gutenberg etexts in one crazy file with one header for the whole shebang cuz we lowkey hate extra overhead and the gopher site crew was like “ditch them headers plz” – but legal bussiness demands these headers ride at the top in all user zones, so here we are, staying extra safe with donations and all that jazz. if you spot our books posted anywhere without these mega headers, slide into the admin dms and request a header reattach, or else it’s like, legal protection ghost mode and we lose those donation vibes  
   
***start**the small print!**for public domain etexts**start***  
why’s this “small print!” lit statement here? bc lawyers, duh – they’re like “if something’s sus with your free etext copy (even if it’s free from someone else), you might try to sue, even if it ain’t our fault” – so this small print is basically us yeeting most liability. also, it spills the tea on how you can share this etext if u wanna get your clout on  
   
*before!* you peep or vibe with any part of this project gutenberg-tm etext, by reading or using it you’re basically saying “i get it, i’m down, and i accept this small print chaos” – if not, you can yeet a refund request within 30 days (if you even dropped cash on it) by pinging the person who sent it your way – if you copped it on a disc or some physical medium, you gotta send that bad boy back too, aight?  
   
about project gutenberg-tm etexts:  
this project gutenberg-tm etext (and basically most of them) is a public domain bae dispensed by professor michael s. hart through the project gutenberg association at illinois benedictine college (aka the project) – meaning no one holds a usa copyright on this masterpiece so everyone (yep, even you!) can copy or slap it online without askin’ for permission or paying any royalty fees. if u wanna copy or spread it under the project’s "project gutenberg" trademark, peep the special rules below – it’s all very extra, but duh  
   
to craft these etexts, the project pours in hella effort to spot, transcribe, and proofread public domain dope works – but even with that sigma grindset, these etexts (and whatever medium they chill on) might show some “defects” like incomplete, glitchy, or corrupted data, transcribing oopsies, potential intellectual property mix-ups, busted disks, nasty viruses, or computer codes that make your tech rage-quit, lol  
   
limited warranty; disclaimer of damages:  
aside from the “right of replacement or refund” deets below, [1] the project (and whoever else dropped this project gutenberg-tm etext in your lap) disclaims ALL liability for any damages, fees, or extra costs (yeah, including legal fees – big yikes) and [2] you’re totally on your own for any negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty/contract shenanigans – even indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages, even if you dropped a “heads up” on those possible damages  
   
if you spot a defect in this etext within 90 days of receiving it, you can snag a refund – just send an epic note explaining the tea within that time to whoever sent it your way; if you got a physical copy, return it with your note, and they might hook you up with a replacement copy – if it’s digital, they might give you another shot at the download  
   
this etext is served “as-is” – no other warranties (express or implied) are dished out, not even for merchantability or fitness for a specific vibe  
   
some states are like “nah, you can’t yeet these disclaimers” so the above deets might not apply to you, and you might have extra legal rights – vibe responsibly, fam  
   
indemnity:  
you’re on the hook to indemnify and hold the project, its board, and all its squad members totally harmless from any and all damages, costs, and fees (legal ones too, omg) arising directly or indirectly from any of these moves: [1] sharing this etext, [2] altering/modifying it, or [3] any defect that pops off  
   
distribution under "project gutenberg-tm":  
you can share copies of this etext electronically, on a disk, in a book – literally any medium as long as you either yeet this "small print!" and all project gutenberg shoutouts, or:  
   
[1] drop only exact copies – meaning don’t remove or tweak the etext or this small print drama. you can share it in machine-readable binary, compressed, markup, or proprietary form (like if you convert it via word processing or hypertext software) as long as *either*:  
  [*] the etext, when fired up, is super clear fr and doesn’t have any extra funky characters besides those the OG author intended (tilde (~), asterisk (*), and underline (_) are cool to signal punctuation vibes) or  
  [*] the etext can be easily re-converted to plain ascii, ebcdic, or something equivalent by the program that vibes with the etext (like most word processors these days), or  
  [*] you drop, or agree to drop on request, a copy of the etext in its OG plain ascii form (or equivalent) with zero extra cost  
   
[2] honor the etext refund and replacement rules in this small print epilogue  
   
[3] cough up a trademark license fee to the project equal to 20% of the net profits you score (computed with the method you use for your taxes). if you ain’t making profits, then chill – no royalty needed. royalties get sent to "project gutenberg association / illinois benedictine college" within 60 days after you prep (or were legally forced to prep) your annual tax return  
   
what if you *want* to drop money even if you don’t have to?  
the project is mega thankful for contributions in cash, time, scanner machines, ocr software, public domain etexts, royalty-free copyright licenses, and any other kind of contribution you can imagine – money gets dropped to "project gutenberg association / illinois benedictine college"

december, 1971  [etext #1]  
   
the project gutenberg etext of the declaration of independence  
   
all the original project gutenberg etexts from the 1970’s were all in all-caps – like, no lowercase vibes cuz the old computers didn’t even know what lowercase was, deadass  
   
this is a dope retranscription of one of the first project gutenberg etexts, officially dated december, 1971 – and then re-released officially on december 31, 1993 (big comeback energy, amirite?)  
   
the united states declaration of independence was the first etext dropped by project gutenberg, early in 1971 – the title was stored in an emailed instruction set which required some tape or diskpack to be hand mounted for retrieval – the diskpack was like a giant cake in a cake carrier, cost a cool $1500, and held 5 mb of data, of which this file is just 1-2% of that cake, lol – two tape backups were kept plus one on paper tape – the 10,000 files we’re hyped to have online by 2001 should only take like 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001 (mind blown)  
   
this file was never copyrighted or sharewared, so it’s totally for all y’all to use and copy however you wanna – feel free to craft your own epic edition using this as your base  
   
in reasearching this transcription of our first etext, i came across a ton of discrepancies (even in the official usa docs) that prove even “facsimiles” of the declaration of indendence are gonna be all over the place – capitalization, punctuation, and even where names pop up (i left out some names bc they were sus)  
   
this version got rid of a bunch of misspellings from those old parchment facsimiles back in 1971, including stuff like “brittain” which is just nah, fam  
   
**the project gutenberg etext of the declaration of independence**  
   
=======================================================================  
   
note: this html remix of the original project gutenberg etext #1 was smashed into being on august 4, 2018 to replace that old auto-generated file, making sure this epic pg work could be read on mobile screens – plus, we threw in images of thomas jefferson’s hand-drafted copy of the declaration of independence for extra clout. the OG project gutenberg header and footer are still in the mix, so it’s all legit.

the declaration of independence of the united states of america  
   
when in the course of human events, like, it becomes mad necessary for one squad of peeps to yeet the political bands that been connecting them to another crew, and to squad up among the powers of the earth with a separate and equal status that the laws of nature and nature’s god totally hook ‘em up with – a major respect for the opinions of the overall human experience demands that they spill the tea on the causes that are driving them to split up, no cap, period.  
   
we hold these truths to be self-evident, like, for real, that all humans are created equal – each one of us is blessed by our creator with straight-up unalienable rights, which include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (big mood AF). to secure these rights, governments are set up among men, drawing their just powers straight from the consent of the governed (facts only), and whenever any form of government goes off the rails and becomes destructive to these ends, it is totally the right of the people to flip the script or yeet that government altogether and start fresh with a new one – built on bomb principles and organized in a way that’s most likely to keep us safe and happy, fr. prudence (aka common sense) even says that governments that have been around a minute shouldn’t be tossed aside for petty, transient drama; and history shows that people would rather suffer through some evils as long as they’re bearable than actually smash the system they’re used to. but when a long train of abuses and power trips, always chasing the same shady objective, shows a plan to reduce the peeps under total despotism, then it is not only their right but their duty to yeet that government and squad up with new guards for future security – such has been the chill patience of these colonies; and now the need is real that forces them to flip their old government systems.  
   
the history of the present king of great britain is basically a highlight reel of repeated injuries and power grabs, all aiming to set up an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let the facts drop for a candid world, deadass.  
   
he has refused his assent to laws that are super wholesome and necessary for the public good – like, major no thanks, bro.  
   
he straight up forbidden his governors from passing laws on the fly that are urgent AF unless they’re suspended until his blessing drops; and even when they’re suspended, he ghosted on actually handling them.  
   
he wouldn’t pass other laws that could help large squaddies of people unless those peeps agree to ditch their right to representation in the legislature – a right that’s literally priceless and only gives major power vibes against tyrants.  
   
he called together legislative crews at wild, uncomfortable, and hella far-out spots away from where the public records are stashed, just to drag them into bending to his extra measures.  
   
he dissolved representative houses on repeat, just cuz they stood up with mad manly firmness against his invasions on peeps’ rights.  
   
after dissolutions, he ghosted for a long time on organizing new elections so that legislative powers (which are like, too big to be totally annihilated) got tossed back to the people, leaving the state exposed to invasions from outsides and internal convulsions – major sus energy.  
   
he even tried to block the growth of these states, straight-up obstructing naturalization laws for foreigners and refusing to drop new laws that would encourage migration here, while cranking up the conditions for new land appropriations – like, chill, bro.  
   
he straight-up obstructed justice by refusing to sign off on laws that would set up judiciary powers – mad disrespect, tbh.  
   
he made judges ride solely on his will for as long as they held office, including boss-level control over their salaries – total power trip much?  
   
he went on a spree erecting a bajillion new offices and sent swarms of officers to hound our people and snack on their resources, like an unending skibidi invasion, no lie.  
   
he kept us, even in peace times, rocking standing armies without getting a nod from our legislatures – major tell-me-not-your-business energy.  
   
he acted like he was making the military totally independent of and superior to the civil power – yeah, as if.  
   
he teamed up with others to subject us to some shady foreign jurisdiction that isn’t even in our constitution or laws, giving his yea to their bogus acts of making up laws – straight-up sketch.  
   
for quartering huge squads of armed troops among us, like, turning our spaces into a military mosh pit,  
   
for protecting these troops by staging a fake trial to shield them from punishment for any murders they pull on our peeps,  
   
for cutting off our trade with literally every corner of the globe – major economic cringe,  
   
for slapping taxes on us without our say-so,  
   
for robbing us in tons of cases of the right to a trial by jury – such a raw deal,  
   
for shipping us off over seas to be tried for bogus offenses – total extra, fam,  
   
for axing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province, setting up an arbitrary gov, and blowing up its boundaries so it serves as a trashy example and tool for installing the same absolute rule in these colonies,  
   
for snatching away our charters, abolishing our best laws, and straight-up remixing the forms of our governments,  
   
for suspending our very own legislatures and declaring themselves the lowkey supreme squad with the power to drop laws for us on every damn occasion.  
   
he bailed on governing here by declaring us out of his protection and then going full trigger on us in a war – a straight-up double clutch betrayal.  
   
he plundered our seas, wrecked our coasts, burned our towns, and straight-up trashed the lives of our people – major dark energy.  
   
he’s currently shipping in massive armies of foreign mercenaries to complete his works of death, devastation, and tyranny – stuff that’s already off the chain with cruelty and perfidy that’s rarely seen even in the nastiest eras, and totally unworthy of being led by a so-called civilized head – major cringe alert.  
   
he forced our fellow citizens, grabbed captive on the high seas, to wield arms against their own country, turning them into executioners for their own squad or facing death by their own hands – talk about savage betrayals, amirite?  
   
he stirred up domestic insurrections among us and practically goaded the inhabitants of our frontiers into chaos with those merciless indian savages, whose warfare is just an all-out, no filter, destruction spree of everyone regardless of age, gender, or status – major chaos vibes.  
   
through every phase of these oppressions, we peeped at redress in the most humble tone ever – our repeated petitions got answered only with repeated injuries, like, “bruh, no listen!” a prince whose character is marked by every tyrannical move is just unfit to rule a free squad, period.  
   
and yo, we didn’t even slack on our british brethren – we warned them time and again about their legislature’s sketchy attempts to extend illegal jurisdiction over us, reminded them about the whole emigration and settlement sitch, and appealed to their native justice and big-heart vibes, even conjuring them by our mutual common kinship to disavow these shady power grabs that would inevitably wreck our connections and convos – but nah, they were as deaf as NPCs to the call of justice and family ties. so we’re forced to accept the harsh necessity that signals our separation, and we hold them, like we hold the rest of mankind, as enemies in war and, in peace, as friends (if that’s even possible in these wild times).

yo, we, like, representin' the squad of the usa, deadass in general congress assembled and callin' on the supreme judge of the whole world (no cap, ultimate mod vibes) for our righteous intentions, so in the name and by the authority of the good peeps of these colonies, we solemnly drop this fire declaration and proclaim: these united colonies are, on god, meant to be free and totally independent states; they’ve yeeted all allegiance to that brit crown npc and ghosted any political hookups with great britain like total cancel culture, lol, and as free and independent states, they got full power to crank up war, seal peace, lock down alliances, spark commerce, and pull all other lit moves that independent states rightfully do, fr fr, asdfgh jkl, straight up!

december, 1972 [etext #2] (yo, vintage vibes, lit af, skrrt)

****the project gutenberg etext of the u. s. bill of rights**** (mega legal drip, no cap, turn up)

the united states bill of rights. (law flex, legit constitution energy, deadass)

the ten original amendments to the constitution of the united states passed by congress september 25, 1789 ratified december 15, 1791 (old school drip, mega historic, lol)

i

congress ain't gonna make no law respecting any establishment of religion or banning you from free flexin' your spiritual vibe, nor clip your ability to spit off speech, blast the press, or peaceably squad up and hit the gov with petitioned grievances, on god, no cap, straight up glitch mode.

ii

yo, a well-regulated militia is crucial for our free state security, so the right of the peeps to keep and bear arms is untouchable – keep that flex, deadass, yeet any infringement.

iii

no soldier can crash at your crib in peacetime without your legit consent, and even during war they gotta roll in a law-approved way – period, skrrt!

iv

the people got the right to be mad secure in their persons, cribs, docs, and loot, against bogus searches and snatch-ups; no warrant pops off unless there's proper probable cause, backed by an oath and a full deets rundown on exactly what and where is gettin' searched – on god, full specs, lol.

v

no one gets dragged to answer for a capital or notorious crime unless a grand jury (the ultimate squad of judges) throws down an indictment, except for those in land, naval, or militia action during war or danger; and you can’t be double jeopardized for the same lame offense, forced to snitch on yourself, or stripped of life, liberty, or property without due process – and no one’s private drip gets snatched for public use without fair coin, fr fr.

vi

in any criminal drama, the accused scores a speedy, public trial served by an impartial jury from the state/district where the deed went down – all by law – and gets full deets on the charges, faces the haters (witnesses), can force-compel favoring peeps, and snag legal counsel for defense, deadass, super fast.

vii

in common law suits where the beef is over twenty bucks, the right to a jury trial stays solid, and no fact once dropped by a jury gets rehashed in any us court except under proper common law rules – no replays, asdfg.

viii

excessive bail ain’t allowed, no mega fines or savage, extra cruel punishments thrown down – that’s a big yikes, bro.

ix

the list of rights in the constitution don’t cancel out all the other dope rights the peeps already hold – you still keep your extra sick rights, deadass.

x

any powers not handed to the usa by the constitution or banned from the states are reserved for the states or the people – full freedom mode, on god.

1.e.3. if a project gutenberg™ work gets posted with the copyright holder's okay, then your use and sharin' must jam with 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 plus any extra terms they drop. those extra deets will show up linked in the pg™ license at the start of the work, yo.

   • second, offer a full refund if a user notifies you in writin' (or by email) within 30 days of receipt that they don't vibe with the full pg™ license. they must then return or destroy all physical copies and cut off access to any other copies of pg™ works.

1.f.2. limited warranty, disclaimer of damages - so aside from the “right of replacement or refund” in para 1.f.3, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation, the trademark boss, and any squad dropping a project gutenberg™ electronic work under this wack agreement are basically ghosting u on any liability for damages, costs, and expenses – even lawyer fees, deadass. u agree that u got no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or contract except the rad bits in para 1.f.3, and u straight up agree that the foundation, trademark owner, and any distributor under this deal won’t be liable for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages even if u holler about potential damage, omg yeah on god

1.f.3. limited right of replacement or refund - so if u spot a defect in this electronic masterpiece within 90 days of copping it, u can snag a refund on the cash (if any) by sliding a written explanation to the person who hooked u up, no cap. if u got the work on a physical medium, u gotta return that medium along with your written tea. the homie or entity that sent u the glitchy work might choose to drop a replacement copy instead of refunding the bag, and if it was all digital, they might hit u with a second shot to get it electronically instead of refunding. but if the second drop is still sus, u can demand a refund in writing with zero second chances, deadass, yeet!

1.f.5. some states are like nah to disclaiming certain implied warranties or cutting out/limiting certain damage types; if any disclaimer or limitation in this wild agreement breaks state law, then it gets remixed to hit the maximum disclaimer or limitation allowed by that state’s law, fr fr. and btw, if one part is invalid or unenforceable, it doesn’t cancel out the rest of the lit deets, omg, no cap

1.f.6. indemnity - u straight up agree to indemnify and hold harmless the foundation, the trademark boss, any agent or employee of the foundation, anyone droppin copies of project gutenberg™ electronic works as per this deal, and any volunteer homies behind the production, hype, and distribution of project gutenberg™ electronic works, from any liability, costs, and expenses (lawyer fees included) that pop off directly or indirectly from any of the following cray moves u do or trigger: (a) distributing this or any project gutenberg™ work, (b) messing with, modding, or adding/deleting stuff in any project gutenberg™ work, and (c) any defect u cause – deadass, no cap, yeet
