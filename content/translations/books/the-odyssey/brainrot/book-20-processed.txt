yooo, so big man odysseus crashed in the porch area,
straight up on an unprocessed cowhide—like dude was too done to care—
and on top he had piles of sheep fleeces, all from the sacrifices
the achaean dudes were always lighting up for dinner.
eurynome flung a cloak over him so he wouldn't freeze or whatever.

but odysseus wasn't about that restful vibe,
he had murder on his mind, replaying endless suitor drama,
and he was wide awake in the night, hearing the maids slipping out
to get cozy with those clown suitors, giggling and acting cringe.
deadass, odysseus wanted to pounce and off them all on the spot,
debated in his soul whether to do it now or let them stray that one last time.
his heart was basically a raging pitbull, barking inside him,
like a mama dog snapping at some rando near her pups.
but old odysseus slapped his chest and whispered:

“chill, heart. for real, you've tanked way worse:
remember when that cyclops was chowing down your homies,
and we were seconds from being his midnight snack?
you had the grit to get me outta that cave, so keep the same energy.”

so he scolded his furious spirit, and it cooled,
but he tossed around all night like a chunk of meat sizzling on hot coals,
smoke swirling in all directions—he was that restless.
he kept cooking up angles on how one single man
would throw hands with all these trifling suitors.

that’s when athena descended, disguised as a woman,
and stood over his head, like “why you up, bestie?
your house is still yours, your wifey right inside,
and your kid's vibin'—isn’t that what you prayed for?”

odysseus, arch-genius, shot back,
“goddess, big facts, but i’m stressing how i can drop the suitors
when i’m just one dude and they’re hella deep.
plus, once i pull it off, how do i not get canceled by the entire island?
tell me that.”

athena went, “bro, you savage or what? i’m a goddess,
i literally got your back the entire time, from day one.
even if fifty squads of mortal soldiers tried to clap you,
you’d still be gucci. trust me, get some shut-eye, no cap.
pull an all-nighter worrying, that’s a skill issue.”

with that, she lulled him into a sweet sleep,
then soared back up to olympus.

penelope was also restless in her bed, crying softly.
once she’d wept enough tears to fill a bathtub, she prayed to artemis:
“omg queen artemis, daughter of zeus, can you just snipe me
with an arrow and set me free from this clown show? or maybe a tornado
can whisk me away, deposit me into the ocean’s swirl,
like those poor daughters of pandareus who got snatched by harpies.
that’d be better than dealing with these cringe suitors and missing my man.
ugh, nights are torture. day brings tears, sure, but then sleep’s supposed
to kill the pain. yet i keep dreaming of him—some nights i swear
i see odysseus standing there, and i get that heartbreak anew.”

she sobbed till early dawn crept in, all golden and glorious.
odysseus heard her moans, thinking maybe she recognized him.
he folded up his bedding, stowed it inside,
lifted his hands to zeus like, “bro, if you brought me home,
give me a sign from inside these walls, plus a big omen from outside.
let me know it’s time to flex.”

old father zeus heard and boomed thunder from bright olympus.
odysseus glowed at that. then from the mill-house,
the grinding maid squealed out, “dang, father zeus, that was a big clap
from a crystal-clear sky. yo, i hope today’s the last day
these suitors pig out in odysseus’s place. they’ve broken my back
grinding flour for them. let them eat their final meal.”
odysseus beamed, hearing her random outburst plus zeus’s thunder,
feeling sure these bums would pay.

the rest of the maids fired up the hearth, with telemachus rolling out of bed
like a demigod, strapping on his slick sandals and blade,
spear shining with fresh-forged bronze. he stepped to the threshold,
asked eurycleia if the guest was treated right, or just ghosted.

“ma'am,” he said, “did you guys at least feed him or give him a bed?
cuz my mom’s vibe is weird: she can hype strangers who suck
and ignore the real ones.”

the old nurse was like, “nah, boy, don’t blame her,
he drank wine, said he was good, we offered a bed but he insisted
on crashing on cowhide. guess that’s his aesthetic.
that’s all.”

so telemachus grabbed his spear and marched off, his two dogs trailing,
down to the agora for whatever drama was next.

eurycleia told the maids, “all right, let’s deep-clean this house,
wipe everything down, set the seats with purple covers,
scrub the tables, rinse out the cups. hustle to the spring for water.
the suitors will be here soon for another feast day.”

the maids hopped to it, half headed for water, half scrubbing floors.
the herdsmen rolled in, chopping wood for the roasts,
and eumaeus arrived with three prime hogs for the suitors.
he let them roam inside the penned yard, then whispered to odysseus,
“buddy, hopefully folks respect you more today.”

odysseus sighed, “i wish the gods would punish these suitors—
they are savage, no shame. i’m stuck waiting, but soon…”

melanthius, that goat-herd troll, showed up next with the best goats in tow,
and he spat at odysseus again:
“still here, old beggar? be fucking for real, get lost or catch these hands.
why you mooching our vibes? guess we’ll have to forcibly toss you.”

odysseus just gave him that silent death-stare,
but inside he was like, “keep yapping, kid, your day is coming.”

then third came philoeitius, the cattle boss, leading a cow and some goats,
fresh off a ferry from the mainland.
he tethered them, then walked up to eumaeus:
“so who’s this stranger? from what city?
he looks like a king down on his luck. the gods can savage even a boss.”
with that, he grabbed odysseus’s hand:
“yo, father, i hope the best for you,
though you sure caught the l in life. i can’t see you without remembering
odysseus. man, i wish he’d show up again. we got loads of big cattle now,
all grown, but the suitors keep devouring them. they don't care about
the prince or fear the gods. they just want to carve up everything
odysseus built. some days i think i should bounce with the herd,
but i still hope odysseus might roll up and clap them. sigh.”

odysseus said, “bro, you’re good peoples. so here’s my oath:
zeus and the hospitality gods be witness, odysseus is near.
you’ll see it with your own eyes when the suitors get absolutely canceled.”
philoeitius was like, “omg, if that actually goes down, see how i flex.”
and eumaeus too prayed to all the gods for odysseus’s epic homecoming.

meanwhile, the suitors were plotting telemachus’s demise again,
but suddenly an eagle soared leftwards with a dove in its talons—a total sign.
amphinomus, one of the less cringe suitors, read the omen:
“guys, maybe let’s not jump telemachus, that omen says nah.
let’s just feast.” so they strolled into odysseus’s hall, set down cloaks,
sacrificed goats, swine, and an ox, roasted them up.
the swineherd poured wine for everyone, philoeitius served bread,
and melanthius toted the rest.

telemachus strategically seated odysseus by the stone threshold,
gave him a small table, big portion of the roasted innards, and a golden cup,
like, “here, vibe here with your wine. i’ll protect you from these fools,
since this place is my dad’s, not theirs.
y’all suitors better not get out of pocket.”

they all bit their lips, fuming that telemachus was talking so bold,
but antinous hissed, “fine, we’ll swallow it for now,
zeus isn’t letting us pop off just yet.”

the heralds then prepped the big holiday sacrifice to apollo.
the suitors roasted up the meats and started feasting,
handing an equal share to odysseus, thanks to telemachus.

but pallas athena wasn’t about letting them behave.
she wanted odysseus’s rage to reach max,
so she had a suitor named ctesippus, loaded with wealth from same,
step up and act even more extra.
he goes, “hey y’all, the beggar got his portion, but i’ll toss him a gift too!”
then he threw a cow’s hoof at odysseus.
odysseus just matrix-dodged that, and it banged against the wall.

telemachus barked, “ctesippus, that was so sus, man. you missed, or else
i’d have pinned you with a spear. you’d be having a funeral, not a wedding.
nobody better flex with savage antics in this house.
i've put up with a lot, but i see everything now.
don’t test me.”

everyone just fell silent, until agelaus spoke softly,
asking telemachus to get real, let his mom marry already,
since odysseus obviously ain’t coming.
telemachus retorted, “dude, i don’t stop her from remarriage,
i just won’t forcibly kick her out. blame me not.”

athena then made the suitors laugh maniacally, twisted their minds,
so they drooled bloody nonsense, and tears welled in their eyes,
their hearts sensing doom.
theoclymenus the prophet saw the omen: “y’all are doomed, i see night creeping in.
the walls drip blood, ghosts crowd the door. the sun is snuffed.
the end is near.”

they clowned him: “this prophet’s loco, telemachus keeps bad guests, lol.”
theoclymenus said, “i’m out, i sense major meltdown coming your way. no thanks.”
he dipped to piraeus’s house, leaving the suitors to cackle.

the punks teased telemachus: “dang, you’re trash at hosting.
first that old bum, now a psycho prophet.
we might as well ship them off to sicily for coin.”

telemachus said nothing, just glancing at odysseus, waiting to strike.
penelope sat across, quietly watching it all go down,
listening to the suitors' rowdy jokes while they prepared a feast—
the final fiasco they'd ever devour.
the gods and that strong man odysseus were about to unleash some big-time karma,
because these clowns had it coming.
