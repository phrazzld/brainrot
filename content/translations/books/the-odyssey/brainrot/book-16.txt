yooo so as dawn pulled up, odysseus and the swine-dude eumaeus
were out here cooking a morning feast, stoking that cozy fire,
sending the herdsmen off with their snorting pig squad.
then telemachus shows up—dogs start wagging, not barking,
which makes the incognito king think, “oh bet, a friend’s rolling in.”

eumaeus is like, “someone’s definitely pulling up—
the pups ain’t yapping. i hear footsteps.”
sure enough, telemachus steps through the doorway,
and eumaeus freaks out with fatherly tears,
kissing telemachus’s head and eyes, hugging him tight
like he’s just come back from years at war.

“child, you’re a whole sunrise to me,” the swineherd spouts,
“never thought i’d see you again, after you zoomed to pylos.
come in, let me feast my eyes on you.
i know you’d rather lurk around the suitors,
but sometimes you gotta vibe with us in the fields, just sayin’.”

telemachus goes, “yeah, i had to come check on you, old friend.
also, i got tea: is my mom still in the crib, or has she caved
to some random suitor, letting my father’s bed gather cobwebs?”

eumaeus: “nah, queen penelope is still standing firm,
though she’s basically crying her eyes out day and night.”
he takes telemachus’s spear, leads him inside.

odysseus, disguised as the old beggar, tries to give up his seat,
but telemachus is all, “nah, you stay. i’ll find another seat.
someone bring me a bench or something.”

so they eat leftover roasted meats from the day before,
bread in wicker baskets, pouring sweet wine from a wooden bowl,
and telemachus finally goes, “yo, eumaeus, who’s this rando?
where’d he come from? how’d he get here? i doubt he walked.”

the swineherd explains the cretan backstory odysseus made up:
“he claims he’s from crete, drifting city to city (the usual sob story).
he ended up ditching a thesprotian ship near my shack,
and i’m giving him lodging. up to you how we treat him.”

telemachus: “bro, i’m stuck in a tough spot.
i can’t exactly host him at the palace with suitors on demon time,
‘cause i’m young and can’t manhandle them all if they get savage.
still, i’ll dress him in fresh drip, give him a sword and sandals,
then maybe send him wherever he wants.
or, if you prefer, keep him here, feed him, i’ll drop off supplies,
since i really don’t want him vibing with those suitors—
they’re too based in their own chaos, they might bully him,
and that’d put me in my feels. i can’t front with that many men.”

odysseus, still under disguise, jumps in:
“hey, i feel your pain about these suitors.
but real talk: are you letting them walk all over you,
or is the public throwing shade, or do your brothers bail on you?
like, if i were your age, i’d come in swinging, no cap.
rather die on my feet than watch them clown your house.
but that’s me.”

telemachus: “not that simple. we’re cursed with small numbers.
granddad laertes had only one kid—odysseus,
odysseus only had me, and now i’m out here basically orphaned.
and every top dog from the isles (dulichion, samé, zacynthus,
and even right here in rocky ithaca)
is gunning for my mom’s hand, draining my estate.
she can’t just bounce them or pick one. i’m stuck.
but never mind that—i need you, eumaeus,
to run and tell my mom i’m back safe from pylos,
quietly. keep it hush from everyone else, we got ops.
and, oh yeah, mention it to laertes if you want;
the old man’s in meltdown mode, but we can’t fix everything at once.
just handle the queen for now.”

the swineherd laces up his sandals, heads out.
athena spots him leaving, swoops close in the form of a tall pretty woman,
but telemachus can’t see—only odysseus and the dogs do.
the pups whine, slink away. the goddess signals odysseus out into the yard:
“time to reveal the vibes to your boy. no more capping.
team up and plan the suitors’ downfall. i’ll have your back,
though i won’t do all the work.”

she taps him with her golden wand, and—bam—
odysseus’s beggar rags vanish, his body glows up,
fresh tan, thick beard, brand-new garments,
looking godlike. then she dips.
odysseus goes back in; telemachus is shook,
eyes wide, thinking, “whoa, you had a big transformation.
you must be some deity. be chill with me, i’ll bring offerings.”

odysseus says, “no, son, i’m your real dad, the one you’ve been missing.
athena just gave me a cameo glow-up. come on, let’s cry it out.”
he kisses telemachus, tears streaming down.
the kid can’t believe it: “naw, no way. some trickster god’s faking me out.”

odysseus: “not a chance. it’s me. i’ve been through a million horrors,
twenty years adrift, but i’m finally home, thanks to athena’s big cheat codes.”
so father and son meltdown, sobbing like eagles
whose chicks got stolen from the nest. it’s a big tear-fest,
till eventually telemachus is like, “so how the heck did you get here?”

odysseus: “phaeacians gave me a lift, loaded me with gifts,
then dumped me sleeping on ithaca’s shore.
athena told me to hide it all in a cave, and now i’m here
so we can plot revenge. tell me, how many suitors we dealing with?”

telemachus breaks down the numbers: “listen,
there’s 52 from dulichion plus 6 henchmen,
24 from samé, 20 from zacynthus, 12 from right here,
plus a bard, a herald, and two servers. it’s a whole mob.
no way can we 2v1,000 them, right?”

odysseus: “hold up, we got zeus and athena on our side.
that’s enough. tomorrow you go home, mix among them,
act normal. eumaeus will bring me in disguised as a crusty beggar.
they’ll probably clown me, maybe fling me out by my feet—
you gotta keep your cool. when the time is right, i’ll nod,
and we stash all the suitors’ gear, claiming ‘it’s old and battered,
plus we’re tryna prevent drunken brawls. metal might kill a vibe.’
leave us two sets of swords and spears for the final showdown.
and do not, i repeat do not, leak i’m back—
not to laertes, not to penelope, not even to the staff.
we gotta see who’s loyal or not.”

telemachus: “bet, father.
though i think we should skip testing the male servants right now—
time’s short. but for sure we check the ladies who scorn or who vibe.
that’s the move.”

with that father-son conspiracy hammered out,
the scene shifts to the harbor: telemachus’s black ship arrives,
his crew stashes the gear at clytios’s house, and a herald sprints to penelope
like “yo, the prince is back!”
the suitors gather, moody they missed their ambush.
antinoös is like, “damn, the gods have him protected.
we gotta fix this. kill him in the field asap, or watch him blow up our spot.”
but amphínomos, more chill, goes, “hold up, guys, let’s see what the gods want.
if zeus blesses it, sure, but if no, then we shouldn’t.”

so that’s that. they shuffle into odysseus’s place,
plop down in fancy seats. penelope storms in,
reads antinoös to filth for planning to kill telemachus,
reminding him how odysseus once saved his father’s bacon.
eurymachus tries to pacify her with sweet words,
secretly plotting telemachus’s downfall anyway.

night falls. eumaeus returns to the pig-sty,
they sacrifice a hog for dinner. athena shows up again,
changes odysseus back into beggar mode so eumaeus won’t suspect.
telemachus asks for news: “are the suitors watching the roads?”
eumaeus basically says, “idk, i saw a ship loaded with guys in armor,
probably them, but i hustled back.”

they finish feasting on that succulent pig,
wine flows, hearts are full, then they all drift to sleep,
plotting in their minds the next day’s big moves.
