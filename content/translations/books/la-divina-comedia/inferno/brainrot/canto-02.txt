the day was clocking out, sky going bruise-mode
shutting down all creatures from their daily grind
but i alone geared up to bear this load

a war of pity and of trek in mind,
my mental playlist spinning anxious vibes—
so high-key, muses, pull up, i’m in a bind.

o lofty brain, who wrote what eyeballs spied,
please show your regal glow, and flex your might:
let’s see if i can keep it bona fide.

i started: “poet, you who guide me right,
check if my skillset’s stable—kinda suss—
before i trust your plan for scaling height.

you talk of silvio’s dad, still mortal plus
he got to see the deathless realm in full,
and that was real, no rumor cappin’ us.

the all-time foe of evil gave him pull,
knowing big outcomes would one day unfold—
who he would be, what epic role he’d fill.

that’s not a shock if thinkers keep their hold,
since from that root came rome, the empire’s nest,
he soared to heaven as the plan foretold.

that journey taught him secrets for success,
and led to papal crowns and victory grand—
then later, holy paul, the chosen vessel, pressed.

so why me? who says i deserve this land?
i’m no eneas, not paul, got zero clout,
this quest might be a flop i can’t withstand.

if i dip out, i fear i’ll crash, no doubt—
you’re wise, so read me deeper than i say;
my meltdown’s real, might wipe my rational route.”

like someone who rethinks what seemed so yay,
switching the plan mid-move, meltdown style,
so from that rugged slope i sank away,

my bold start fizzled out in cringe denial,
thinking too much, i trashed my first big leap—
my will got shaky, fear was on red dial.

the magnanimous shade then spoke, all deep:
“i see your soul infected with mere dread,
the kind that lures folks back from tasks they keep,

like seeing a beast in shadow—false in head.
to free you from that fear, i’ll tell you how
i came to help the moment my heart bled.

i chilled among those souls on pending row,
till a woman, top-tier blessed, hailed my name—
i bowed, for such a queen commands me so.

her starry eyes outshone the cosmic flame,
and in that angel-voice, so sweetly spun,
she said: ‘mantuan soul of lasting fame,

my bestie’s stuck in some deserted run,
fear dragging him back, undone by cosmic dread;
i’m scared i rose too late to get this done,

from what i glean in heaven’s feed,’ she said,
‘so hurry, deck him out with fancy words
and all the stuff he needs to dodge undead,

i’m beatrice—i nudge you into cords
of rescue; love’s my jam, it makes me speak.
once i face my lord, i’ll praise your chords.’

she paused, and i said: ‘o virtuous freak,
you alone help mortal souls break glass
and rise above each smaller cosmic clique.

your command thrills me; i heed it fast,
just say the word—i’ll open up my heart;
but why risk plunging here, from heaven’s vast?’

she shrugged: ‘i fear no threat that stings like dart;
only things with real savage might should scare,
the rest are dust, zero reason to depart.

by divine grace, no flame can scorch my hair,
nor earthly sorrow pierce me from its gloom;
a noble lady wept for him up there,

her tears swayed lucia, who stormed the room,
then scurried to my seat with old rachel near:
“beatrice, do you not see that mortal’s doom?

he left the basic crowd ‘cause he held you dear—
why can’t you rush and help him not to fail?
don’t you hear him crying out with fear?

the flood’s about to drown him; he’s so frail.”
nobody sprints so fast to chase a prize
or flee a threat as i from bliss’s trail.

confiding in your honest rep so wise,
i dashed down here to yank him off that slope
where that vile beast clipped short his mountain rise.

so what’s the deal? why stall? where is your hope?
why let this cowardice corrode your core?
three blessed ladies hold your safety rope,

and i’m your boy with words that promise more.’
like blossoms once drooped by chill, then touched by sun,
my battered virtue lifted from the floor.

new bravery soared inside me, bright as fun,
and i said, free at last: ‘oh angel so kind
who flew to bail me out when i was done!

and you, whose courtesy jumped on this bind,
your words have fired me up for this campaign;
i’m back to that original dream in mind.

move on—we’re both on that synergy train;
you be my guide, my teacher, all i got.’
so once he stepped, i followed up the lane,

into that savage path, though fear was hot.”
