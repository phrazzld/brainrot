nel mezzo of my cringe life-phase i woke
straight lost in this pitch-black forest swirl, no slay,
the real road had hopped off, left me broke.

real talk, describing that gloom hits me asl, okay?
it was big yikes, a savage level ~999 vibe,
my brain goes delulu just thinking that day.

so bitter i'd rather unsub from life than imbibe;
still, i gleaned a few w’s in that dank zone,
so i’ll overshare the drama i did there subscribe.

honestly, i forgot how i even got flown
into that forest—my mind was snoozing, no clue,
i must've ragequit the real path, all alone.

then i slid up to a hill’s foot, major boohoo,
the valley behind me had big fear energy,
my aura was shot, living rent-free was taboo.

i looked up and—sheesh!—the sun’s synergy
beaming those vibes that guide real ones upward,
my heart-lake cooled from meltdown to synergy.

like some half-drowned rando flailing shoreward
then glancing back at the lethal swirl behind,
i turned around, half shook that i’d not be cornered.

after a short breathe-check, i resumed the grind
up that lonely slope with shaky foot progression,
each step a potential fail so big in my mind.

but right at the slope’s start—big depression—
a sly cheetah-type, sleek body dripped in spots,
fast asf, blocking me with savage oppression.

fr no path forward. i turned back lots,
like “maybe i should bounce or push her aside?”
but it was early morning, sun was shining, hotshots

stars aligned like the day they first high-fived
when divine love said “let there be vibes.”
this vantage made me think i might survive,

but oh, bestie, sike: a lion arrives—
massive big cat, snarling, giving main-character face,
the air legit trembling from his savage drives.

and a she-wolf, queen of infinite craving disgrace,
looking half-dead but thirsting for all the xp,
wrecking humans’ aura, no hush, no place.

that sight canceled my hope instantly—gg,
like a hustler who sees his coins vanish in 4k,
my mind meltdown said “pluh, i got no key.”

the beast shoved me back to the gloom, no delay,
where the sun don’t shine, vibe check utterly dead.
i was doomscrolling downward, stuck in dismay,

till i glimpsed someone with big quiet-thread head,
like he’d been ghosting centuries with no mic.
i shrieked, “have mercy, bestie, help me shed

these beasts! whatever you are—shadow or psyker alike!”
he said, “i once was human, not anymore,
lombards for parents, mantua was our hiking-bike.

born late under julius, lived in rome’s core
under that boss augustus, time of sus gods,
i was a poet, sang of anchises’ kid post-trojan war.

but you, why u-turn to deep drama squads?
why not bounce up that fun mountain with the sweet rizz
the root of all joy—like, hello, skip these odds?”

my jaw dropped: “you’re virgil? legendary whiz,
the top-tier poet who drips words wide as seas?
i study your text with thirst—i’m basically your kid, geez.

you taught me that style that earned me mini-fame,
but see that she-wolf clowning me all savage?
help me out, goat-tier poet—she’s killing my game.”

he noticed my meltdown tears, “buddy, i gauge
you need a different route if you wanna survive.
that wolf never lets a soul cross her storage:

she’s got a nature so cursed, she’ll never be satisfied,
post-meal her hunger’s lit times ten, that’s the tea,
and she’s merging with new squads left and right.

eventually a greyhound will come, free of greed,
feasting on wisdom, love, and virtue (straight facts),
and born between felts: a vibe prophecy indeed.

he’ll be the solution for poor italy’s cracks,
that land where camilla died, also euryalus,
turnus, nisus—straight bodybags, no takebacks.

he’ll chase that she-wolf to her infernal nexus,
the pit envy first unlocked for her savage spree.
so i see your best bet is to follow me, no flexes:

i’ll guide you through the eternal place, you’ll see
the hopeless shrieking in that second death zone,
plus those who do time in fire, but hopefully

they’ll join the blessed eventually, once they atone.
if you wanna get higher, a bigger boss will lead you,
for the top-tier ruler hates me—I’m disowned.

i rebelled, so i can’t vibe in his city, it’s true.
he’s the universal monarch, that’s his brand,
and the seat is up there—holy friend queue.

blessed is the soul he picks to chill in that land!”
i was like, “poet, i’m begging by the god you never met,
save me from these cringe beasts and set me unbanned,

escort me to saint pete’s door, let me pay that debt,
and let me peep those souls you said be crying tears.”
then he stepped forward, the goat guide, no sweat,

and me, dead serious, i followed his footsteps, my dear.
