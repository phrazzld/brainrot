conticuere omnes, and the entire squad was big quiet,
locked eyes on me while i, father aeneas, started from my fancy couch:

“bestie dido, you’re basically asking me
to reopen the absolute trauma:
the final downfall of troy, once-litty kingdom,
the savage meltdown i witnessed front-row seats
(and took a major l in). legit no myrmidon,
no dolopian or gnarly soldier of odysseus
could retell our sorrows without crying asf.
it’s late, the night’s deep, but if you’re that thirsty
for the deets, i’ll try to give you a quick recap,
even though my mind’s trembling remembering.

so: after a decade of war, the greeks are like,
‘we can't get past these trojan walls, bruh, we’re so done.’
finally, they build this absolute giga-horse,
huge like a mountain, courtesy pallas athena’s cheat codes.
they pretend it’s an offering for safe travels home,
and that rumor spreads. but in reality, they stash
elite dudes in the hollow belly—armed to the teeth,
waiting to pop out. we trojans thought they left.
they sailed off and parked behind tenedos, that super-sus island,
and we thought ‘yay, greeks dipped, let’s vibe again!’
the city was unburdened from gloom.

we poured out of the gates, sprinting to the deserted beach,
scoping out the empty greek camps.
some trojans are like, ‘whoa, this giant horse is savage—
gift for virgin minerva, they said? are they capping?’
thymoetes was all for dragging it inside the city:
maybe he was just gullible, or maybe it was our doom anyway.
capys and a bunch of other critical thinkers were like,
“nah, this is hella sus. let’s just burn it or push it off a cliff
or poke it to see if anything’s inside.” the crowd was torn.

then laocoon, trojan priest, hustles down from the citadel,
he’s big pressed: “omg, you trojans seriously believe
the greeks just peaced out for real? this horse is def a trap.
i don’t trust greeks bearing gifts, for real, no cap.”
he hurls a massive spear into the horse’s side,
it rattles, we hear ominous echoes, so if the gods
weren’t out to troll us, we’d have cracked it open right then.
troy would still be standing. but fate said nope.

suddenly, some trojan shepherds drag in a random greek prisoner,
hands tied behind his back, screaming.
this guy, sinon, basically turned himself in on purpose
to set up the con, like next-level op.
trojan youths mob around him, mocking. we were curious.
he’s trembling, tears up, whining about how he’s super unlucky,
greeks want him dead, trojans want him dead—
we vibe-check him. “spill the tea,” we say.
he’s like, “i’ll confess everything, i won’t lie.
i was close to palamedes, that greek hero your enemies murdered.
odysseus canceled him and pinned him with false charges.
i was salty, i talked about revenge, so they turned on me too.
it’s been a whole fiasco. they even roped calchas,
their so-called prophet, into it. basically,
they needed to sacrifice me so they could sail home.
i bounced, broke my chains. i got no home now,
no fatherland, no fam, help me out!”

we fell for the tears, big gullible vibes.
priam unshackles him, gently asks:
“so what’s with the giant horse, bro? who built it, and why?”
sinon lifts his freed hands to the sky:
“the greeks have always relied on athena’s blessing. but
they defiled her statue (palladium) once—
odysseus, diomedes, they snatched it, got cursed signs:
flames in the statue’s eyes, sweat on the marble,
it even jumped thrice from the ground.
calchas said we had to dip back home, regroup,
get athena’s vibe back on our side.
but before leaving, they built this huge wooden effigy
to atone for messing with minerva—
calchas insisted it had to be extra large so you trojans
wouldn’t be able to bring it inside your walls.
‘cause if you do, you’d basically own the goddess’s favor.
then you’d turn the war around, eventually conquering all greece.
but if you violate or burn it, trojan doom times infinity.
that’s the prophecy.”

that’s how the lying tears of sinon scammed us,
something no thousand ships or heroic warriors
could accomplish before.

it gets worse: laocoon, who was neptune’s priest,
is sacrificing a big bull at the altars, when—omg, i get chills—
two giant sea serpents slither from tenedos
through the calm water, heading for shore.
their manes rise above the waves, their scaly bodies
roll behind them, huge and sinister.
everyone flees in terror. the snakes laser-focus on laocoon’s kids,
wrap them up, bite their limbs—one big nightmare.
laocoon tries to help, but then they coil him too,
twice around his waist, strangling with monstrous folds.
he’s covered in black venom, screaming to the stars
like a wounded bull. then the snakes slink away
to minerva’s temple.

the trojans freak: “laocoon’s punishment means
he was guilty of hitting the sacred horse. we gotta bring it inside.”
so we bust open our walls, attach wheels to the horse’s feet,
wrap ropes around its neck, chanting as we drag it in.
kids and maidens sing, hype for the big gift.
four times it stops at the threshold, four times we hear
armor clanging from within. but we’re possessed,
we keep going, place that cursed beast in our citadel.
cassandra tries to warn us, ranting about the future,
but no one believes her. we’re doomed.

night falls, hush blankets troy. the greeks sail back from tenedos
under the silent moon. sinon sneaks over, opens the horse,
and the locked squad emerges: thessandrus, diomedes,
odysseus, menelaus, the whole greek avengers.
they murder the sleeping guards, fling the gates wide open
for the rest of their army.

in my dream i see hector’s ghost, battered, blood-soaked,
dragged by the chariot the way achilles humiliated him.
i sob, ask, “why do you look so messed up, bestie?”
he says, “run, child of a goddess, troy is done for,
the enemy’s inside. you can’t save troy with your right arm.
take our household gods and go found a new city.”
then he disappears, clutching the vestal flame.

i wake, the city’s in chaos, shrieks and clangs of war.
i grab my armor, frantic to help.
panthus, apollo’s priest, rushes in with the sacred gear,
moaning: “it’s the final day, troy is no more,
the horse is spitting out armed greeks, sinon is leading them.
they’re flooding every street.”
i gather a small band, including rhipeus, dymas, coroebus,
who was marrying cassandra—really an unlucky move.
i say: “guys, let’s do or die. there’s no hope but in going feral.”
like wolves starved by hunger, we charge into certain death.
the night is savage. trojans and greeks die in droves.

we spot a group of greeks wandering in the dark.
androgeos mistakes us for greek allies, then freaks out
when he realizes we’re trojans. we ambush them,
coroebus is stoked: “we got their gear, let’s blend in.”
so we do a full cosplay, wearing greek armor.
we kill a bunch more unsuspecting greeks.
but oh no, we get cocky. we see cassandra dragged by her hair
from minerva’s temple, screaming to the sky.
coroebus tries to rescue her, we all charge in.
the greeks rally from all sides—ajax, the atridae, the dolopians.
plus, the greek survivors we’d spooked earlier see us wearing stolen gear.
they identify the mismatch in our voices, and it’s curtains.
coroebus, rhipeus, hypanis, dymas, panthus all die.
none of their piety or virtue saves them.
i’m left with only iphitus and pelias, battered,
hustling to priam’s palace, where a big fight rages—
the greeks are storming the doors with battering rams.

we go up to the rooftop, push a tower down onto them—
a massive crash kills a bunch. but pyrrhus (achilles’s son)
is unstoppable in the courtyard, shining in his bronze,
like a snake fresh out of hibernation,
shedding old skin, gliding in the sun.
he axes down the doors, tears the bronze posts from the hinges.
the greeks pour through, murder the guards, fill every space with steel.
like a raging river busting a dam, flooding fields,
pyrrhus smashes the palace. i see him and the atridae
slaughter priam’s men, hush the courtyard with carnage.

priam arms himself in vain—poor old man.
he sees the city’s doom, puts on dusty armor, stands by the altar.
hecuba and her daughters cling to the statue,
like doves in a black storm, crying.
hecuba begs priam: “why pick up weapons? come to the altar with us.”
but polites, one of priam’s sons, runs in wounded,
pyrrhus chasing with a spear. polites collapses, bleeding out
in front of his parents. priam roars,
“may the gods punish you for that atrocity, pyrrhus!
even achilles showed mercy.”
he lobs a feeble spear, which bounces off pyrrhus’s shield.
pyrrhus sneers: “tell my father i’m savage. now die.”
he drags priam to the altar, stabs him through the side.
so ends priam, who once ruled all asia,
his body decapitated on the shore, nameless.

i’m frozen in horror, remembering my dad anchises,
my wife creusa, my boy ascanius, and i realize i’m alone.
everyone else fled or died.

(i spot helen lurking by vesta’s shrine, terrified of trojan revenge
and greek rage. my fury flares: i want to kill her,
like, “will she just skip back to sparta, a queen, unpunished,
while troy bleeds?” but then my mom, venus, appears in heavenly light,
stops me: “son, this is not helen’s fault. it’s the gods who topple troy.
look, i’ll remove the mortal mist from your eyes so you see how
neptune wrecks the walls with his trident, juno storms the gates,
pallas on the rooftops blazing with lightning,
zeus giving the greeks fresh stamina. run away, i’ll keep you safe.”
and she’s gone. i see the city possessed by deities, no hope left.

i hurry to my dad’s house, wanting to carry him out to safety,
but he refuses: “i’m old, i deserve to die here.
the gods have long hated me since i got zapped by jove’s lightning.
flee, you who still have strength.”
i’m sobbing, begging him not to be stubborn, but he’s firm.
i’m about to run into the battle again, choosing glorious death
over leaving him behind.
creusa begs me: “if you go to die, take us with you, or protect your fam.”
then ascanius’s hair ignites in a harmless flame, a sign from the gods.
anchises prays to jupiter, and a shooting star streaks across the sky.
that’s enough for dad: “fine, i’ll go with you. lead the way.”

i hoist dad on my shoulders, ascanius at my side, creusa behind us.
we slip through the shadows. every sound freaks me out now.
we almost make it beyond the gates, but i get spooked by footsteps,
i lose track of creusa. she disappears in the confusion—
i only notice once we regroup outside the city. i freak, blaming the gods,
leave ascanius and anchises with our comrades, and dash back in.
the city’s 100% ablaze, greeks everywhere.
i see my old house ruined, priam’s palace looted.
i call creusa’s name hopelessly. at last, her ghost appears, bigger than life.
i freeze, hair on end. she says, “why cling to grief? it’s not the gods’ plan
for me to leave troy. you’ll sail to hesperia (italy),
find a new kingdom and a new queen. i remain here with the mother of gods.
take care of our son!” she fades from my arms thrice.

night’s almost over. i rejoin my folks,
and a new crowd has gathered—survivors, ready to follow me anywhere.
dawn breaks, the greeks hold the city gates, no more help is coming.
i pick up dad and leave troy behind, fate swirling like dark clouds overhead.”
