yo, caieta—nurse of aeneas—u got eternal clout on our coast,
your bones brand the land with your name after you dip.
dude aeneas does right by your rites, piles the tomb high,
then bounces as soon as the wild sea calms. sails catch the breeze at night,
moonbeams glow on restless waves. they skirt by circe’s hood,
where that savage sorceress daughter of the sun blasts nonstop bops,
torching aromatic cedar all evening, weaving with her petty loom,
beasts all around—lions raging, bears grunting, boars squealing,
wolves howling—cuz sis turned humans into furballs with her potions.
neptune’s like “nah, you ain’t messing with my trojan day-ones,”
catches them in a tailwind and speeds them right past that cursed shore.

dawn lights the sea red, the sky all rosy-gold,
then the wind just ghosted and the waves became glass.
aeneas spots a *thicc* forest from the water,
the tiber’s swirling mouth gushing goldish silt into the blue.
birds jam around the banks, singing the air mellow.
boss man says “dock up!” and they slip into the shady flow.

listen up, erato, muse bestie, you gotta fill me in:
which kings ruled latium then? what was the vibe?
when the trojans first rolled up with their fleet,
this is where it all starts—messy fights, savage dramas,
tyrrhenians and all hesperia conscripted for war.
the scale’s about to blow up, we’re going big.

latinus, old as fuck, was king in that zone, chilling in a forever peace.
his lineage from faunus and the laurentine nymph marica,
and that line goes up to saturn.
no sons left—fate took them, only a daughter:
lavinia, prime for marriage.
all of latium—like, so many—wanted her.
the biggest hottie was turnus, super noble stock,
queen amata was shipping that couple hardcore, but the gods kept dropping ominous signs.

in the palace’s heart grew an ancient laurel, sacred to phoebus,
planted by father latinus when he first built the citadel,
and once a swarm of bees randomly perched on the top,
the soothsayer was like “some foreign boi is coming to rule from your towers.”
plus, while sacrificing, lavinia’s hair literally caught fire (wild),
the flames crackled, sparkling her headdress with savage glow—
prophets said it spelled big glory for her but straight-up war for the people.

spooked, king latinus visits faunus’s shady oracle in albunea’s grove—
that spot breathes nasty fumes, but all italy hits it up for cryptic messages.
the priest sleeps on fresh sheep pelts at night, sees weird illusions,
hears unholy voices, chats with gods, even hollers at acheron.
latinus kills his hundred sheep, naps, then the voice from the deep says:
“don’t wed your daughter to a local dude, my guy.
foreigners are coming—her kids will raise your name to the stars,
they’ll rule everything the sun sees. bet on it.”

king keeps hush, but rumor game is strong—
and that’s when aeneas’s Trojan crew hitches their ships on the grassy bank.

they plop under a tall tree, lay out their feast,
toss out barley cakes, fruit from the fields—just as jupiter once told them.
they savage the fruit, but hunger hits so hard they start chewing the crust bread holding it.
baby iulus jokes, “bruh, we’re even devouring our plates? w-t-f.”
papa aeneas hears, mind-blown:
“that’s the sign anchor dad anchises prophesied.
this is it: ‘once you’re forced to eat your tables, you’ve found your new crib.’
we’re home now.”
morning after? recon time. “go see who lives here, what kinda city’s out there.”
he does a prayer, ties leaves to his brow, calls on mother earth, nymphs,
night, stars, phrygian mother, father jupiter, everyone.
thunder from the clear sky, a bright golden cloud glows overhead—
the trojans hype up, feeling destiny.
they pour wine, re-up that feast in big vibes.

next day, they scope out latium: the numicus spring, the tiber river, the folks known as latins.
aeneas picks a hundred top-tier trojans to approach the city with an olive branch,
offer gifts, and propose peace.
he himself starts building a basic camp near the shore,
like a mini fort with ditches and ramparts.
the trojan envoys hustle to latinus’s city, see local boys training horses,
racing chariots, shooting arrows, flinging spears.
a messenger gallops to king latinus with news of foreign bros in weird fits.
the king invites them into his tall columned hall, an ancient palace from picus’s day,
where old kings used to hold councils and do sacrifices,
walls stacked with trophies, chariots, axes, helmets, warship prows—flex city.
statue of picus, enthroned, holding the lituus staff, wearing a short cloak,
the same picus circe turned into a woodpecker with her shady wand.
the trojans enter, latinus sits calmly, greets them:

“hey trojan fam, i know your city, your lineage, i heard how you cruised the seas.
why y’all here? storms? searching something?
we’re the saturnian race, living free, no chains or harsh laws.
plus i recall old rumors that dardanus was from these lands,
left to settle phrygia, soared to the stars. he’s basically half local.”

ilioneus replies: “king, we’re not forced by storms or broken star maps.
we got exiled from a monstrous war that destroyed troy.
we want a tiny slice of land, fresh water, just to exist.
trust me, we ain’t bums—our lineage’s from jupiter.
the trojan hero aeneas sends greetings,
he survived the meltdown of asia and europe, no corner of the world is clueless about that war.
we come humbly. many places tried to recruit us, but fate says come here.
we bring you relics from blazing troy—anchises’s sacred gold cups,
priam’s royal scepter and diadem, trojan fabrics. a lil gift.”

latinus is dead silent, eyes pinned on the ground,
but in his mind is that prophecy about a foreign son-in-law.
finally, he smiles: “may the gods bless this sign. you’ll get your wish.
we got farmland, riches; it’s yours. but i want to meet aeneas in person.
tell him i’ve got a daughter, but the gods say she’s fated for a foreign groom
whose bloodline will rule the world. i think that’s your boy.
if my vibe check is right, i pray so.”

he picks out 300 stallions to gift each trojan emissary, decked in gold harnesses.
for aeneas, a chariot with super-fancy horses rumored to breathe fire from their snouts,
spawn of circe’s messing around.
the trojans dip, stoked, bringing back peace from latinus.

meanwhile, juno’s flying home from argos, peeps aeneas’s new digs,
they’re starting to build huts, trusting the land, their ships moored.
she’s pressed, shaking her head: “omg these trojans just won’t die.
troy burned, but they still found a route.
my might is basically spent—I used scylla, charybdis, storms, all that.
they chilling in the tiber? guess i’ll spark some drama. if i can’t keep them from latium,
i can at least delay the marriage, stoke war, make latins and trojans slaughter each other.
lavinia’s dowry will be trojan blood, let bellona be the wedding hype-woman.
let’s do this.”

she summons allecto, a fury from the darkness below,
a vile creature even hades hates.
juno’s like: “girl, i need chaos.
make the latins and these trojans clash.
light the spark, do your evil. push them to arms.”

allecto zooms to the city’s palace, sneaks up on queen amata, who’s mad that latinus wants lavinia to wed a stranger instead of turnus.
the fury launches a snake into amata’s heart; it slithers unseen, driving her mania.
she first tries gentle tears on latinus: “u srsly giving our daughter to random exiles?
do you even care about your wife? your child?
didn’t the trojan prince take helen from sparta and start that giant war??
what about your vow to turnus, your own blood??”
latinus stands firm, so the poison seeps deeper—amata freaks out, storms the city like a top spinning across the courtyard floor,
finally she pretends it’s a bacchic ritual, snatches lavinia, hides her in the forest,
screaming “io bacchus,” dragging a herd of mothers into the hills, shrieking for turnus, cursing the trojans.

job done, allecto flaps away to turnus’s town (ardea),
shapeshifts into an old priestess of juno, confronts him in the dead of night:
“why you letting trojans snatch your bride, your kingdom? gear up, burn their ships!”
he sneers: “stop fearmongering, old hag. wars are men’s business, not your gossip.”
allecto morphs back into fury form, snakes writhing, hissing.
she flings a flaming torch into turnus’s chest:
he jolts awake sweaty, possessed by savage war-lust, summoning his crew to arms.

then allecto targets the trojans directly, finds ascanius out hunting.
there’s a beloved stag raised by tyrrhus’s fam—sylvia’s pet.
ascanius’s dogs flush it out; ascanius shoots an arrow, wounding it.
the bleeding stag limps home, the farmers see red.
tyrrhus snatches weapons, they call neighbors.
allecto blasts a horn from the stable rooftop—
the entire countryside flips out, trojans also rush in with swords.
a real battle flares: flying spears, shining blades, and the first casualties drop, including almo (tyrrhus’s son) and old galaesus.
blood spills, and the fury, mission complete, brags to juno she’s lit the fuse.
juno says, “that’s enough. leave the rest to me.”
allecto zips back to the underworld, hissing.

the wounded farmers pack into latinus’s city, show dead bodies,
turnus roars about trojans stealing the bride, mixing foreign blood.
the mothers possessed by bacchus swirl around, chanting.
everyone begs latinus for war, pressuring him.
like a rock battered by waves, latinus stands firm but eventually sees no escape.
he laments: “you’ll pay for this.” locks himself away, letting fate drag them.

there’s an old custom in latium—opening the gates of war (the temple of janus).
they want the king to do it, but he refuses.
so juno herself storms down, shoves the gates open.
boom—italy ignites. squads gather, burnish shields, sharpen swords, string bows.
five big cities clang on anvils forging new weapons, men rummage for old blades, war horses nicker.
the horns blare, helmets strap on heads, swords gleam.
the land teems with armies.

muse, open up helicon for me—i gotta list the warlords answering the call,
and you remember them well.
first out is mezentius, godless tyrant, with his son lausus at his side, handsome as turnus, leading a thousand from agylla.
next is aventinus, hercules’s descendant, parading his victory horses, sporting hydra on his shield, wearing a lion pelt.
catillus and coras, twin bros, lead argive men from tibur, storming the front lines like bounding centaurs off snowy peaks.
caeculus, rumored son of vulcan, from praeneste, brings a ragtag horde with slings and wolfskin caps.
messapus, neptune’s boy, reassembles old armies, calling them back to steel.
they march singing, like swans across watery meadows.
claustus, from sabine blood, leads a giant wave, seed of the future claudian clan.
throng after throng—amiterna, mutusca, nomen tum, rosea velini, himella, nursia… so many men that the earth shakes under their tramp.

halaesus, sworn enemy of trojan name (descended from agamemnon?), brings a thousand.
his crowd from massic slopes, cales, sidicina’s coast, saticula, big on throwing aclydes with leather straps, small shields on the left.
oebalus (born of telon and a sebethis nymph) commands the sarrasti folks near sarnus, abella’s orchard land, wearing bark helmets.
ufens from nersae, famed for savage hunts, leads tough aeqiculans who love raiding, living off plunder.
umbro, marrovian priest, snake-charmer, can soothe viper bites with spells, but none of that cures trojan spear wounds.
the angitia forest and fucinus lake weep for him.

virbius, son of hippolytus, from aricia’s cool groves near diana’s shrine, also rides out.
they say hippolytus was revived by diana’s herbs after his stepmom’s false charges and fatal crash,
but jupiter smote asclepius for that resurrection cheat.
diana hid hippolytus in secret under an alias.
that’s why diana’s shrine forbids horses—hippolytus’s spooked team once caused chaos.
still, virbius, proud as ever, thunders across the field with his own warhorses.

last, big man turnus steps up, shining above them all, triple-crested helmet roaring out chimera flames,
the beast gets fiercer the more blood spills.
the shield’s painted with io, horns rising, argus the watchman, father inachus pouring his stream.
infantry floods in: argives, aurunci, rutuli, sicani, sacrani, labici with painted shields, plowing the fields along the tiber,
including the marsh near satura and the cold ufens that snakes to the sea.
then rides in camilla from volscian stock, leading cavalry packed in bronze,
a war maiden, no spool-of-wool type—she can outrun the wind,
running atop a field’s standing wheat without breaking a stalk,
skimming ocean waves without wetting a foot.
everyone stares in awe—dudes, moms, you name it—as she glides by,
royal purples on her shoulders, gold clasp in her hair, a lycian quiver on her back,
her spear just a sharpened myrtle staff.
and so the armies swarm, the war mania unleashed, trojans about to catch these hands.
