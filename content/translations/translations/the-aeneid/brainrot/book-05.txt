yap, muse, let’s spit that epic track of book five,
where aeneas is mid-sea, vibe-checking the flames of dido’s meltdown,
her pyre blazing on the horizon—big yikes.
the trojans sense the heartbreak, and they’re like “dang,
we know what a scorned queen can do, especially one that savage.”
but no time to dwell: the swirling waves and a storm by night
force them off-course from italy. palinurus, big pilot energy,
tells aeneas, “fam, we can’t fight these new moody winds.
better try sicily: that’s acestes’s hood, remember?”

so they roll up, speedboating to those “friendly” shores.
acestes, repping a bear pelt and savage javelins, is hype to see them.
he’s half-trojan, so he’s like “let’s go!” loads them up with rustic goodies.

come dawn, aeneas calls the squad together:
“trojan homies, it’s a full year since we laid dad anchises to rest,
and i swore to honor that day, no matter where i roam.
here we are, ironically at a place that’s basically *dad’s old turf*.
let’s do sacrifices, prayers, and oh yeah—some lit funeral games!
toss in bulls for the feasting. i’ll set up boat races, footraces,
archery, boxing (with them savage caestus gloves). do it for the ‘gram, trojans.”
everyone is stoked, grabs some leaves for head-wreaths.

they trek up to anchises’s tumulus. aeneas pours out wine, milk, blood,
scattering purple blossoms, calls on father’s shade: “wish i could be in italy with you,
but i guess i’m out here hustling.”
suddenly, a giant 7-coil snake slithers through the altars, shimmering with gold spots,
peaceful as can be, sippin’ them libations. aeneas is shook.
is it a local genie? is it papa’s personal snake buddy? who knows,
but he doubles down on the sacrifice, even more bident slayings and wine.
everyone else piles on offerings, some grillin’, some slinging out prime cuts.

ninth dawn rises, it’s game time.
aeneas sets up the prizes: shining bowls, tripods, fancy gear,
announces the big ship race. four boats line up:
\- *pristis* by mnestheus, future memmius fam,
\- *chimaera* by gyas, huge triple-row masterpiece,
\- *centaurus* by sergestus,
\- *scylla* by cloanthus.

there’s a big sea-rock for turning around; aeneas sets it as the marker.
the rowers are all in rowdy formation, arms slick with oil, heads wreathed in leaves.
the signal blares, they dash out, waters swirling from savage oars,
like horses out the starting gates. the crowd roars, echoes bounce off hills.

gyas pulls ahead, but his helmsman menoetes steers wide,
fearing the rocks. gyas is big mad: “dude, hug the cliff! you’re going too far out!”
but cloanthus slides inside track, snags the lead—ouch.
gyas is so triggered he boots menoetes overboard, like “k bye,” and takes the helm.
the poor helmsman scrambles onto the rocks, trojans laughing at him spitting saltwater.

that drama gives mnestheus and sergestus a chance to catch up.
sergestus tries to slip ahead, but his boat slams a jagged reef, stuck.
oars snap, his crew meltdown. mnestheus zooms by,
like a spooked dove shooting out a cave.
pristis glides, picks up speed, chasing after cloanthus.
close finish, but cloanthus begs the sea gods: “help me out, i’ll sacrifice a bull!”
portunus literally gives him a nudge, scylla surges, wins 1st place.

aeneas crowns cloanthus with laurel, gifts him lavish prizes:
gold-chased cloak, bull, silver, etc. second place mnestheus gets big gear—
a golden mail vest once from demoleos. third is gyas, a cauldron and silver bowls.
fourth, sergestus, limps in with a battered boat but is still gifted a skilled cretan slave.

next: footraces. big crowd enters—nisus & euryalus, that iconic duo,
plus dires from priam’s line, plus sicilian runners.
aeneas sets up universal gifts but extra for top 3.
the race: nisus zooms ahead, #1 for sure,
but he slips on some sacrificial guts lying in the grass.
he slides and is like “welp,” decides to sabotage salius,
shoving him so euryalus can place first.
the crowd screams about “foul!” but euryalus is pretty and sweet,
and diores also pleads not to let salius cut in line.
aeneas hands out “everyone’s a winner” prizes,
but also hush-hush tosses salius a lion pelt,
then gives nisus a dope shield for comedic consolation.

boxing time: dare s steps up, bragging big. no one else dares challenge him,
so aeneas is about to declare him champ. but acestes pokes old entellus:
“remember your skill? you overcame eryx, hercules, all that. show them.”
entellus, griping about old age, but eventually whips out these ginormous gloves of eryx,
studded with metal and lead. dare s is like, “nah fam.”
they settle for a gentler set of gloves. fight starts: dare s is quick on his feet,
entellus is huge but slower. eventually entellus misses a giant swing,
topples face-first in the dirt. the crowd roars, but he rages back,
pummels dare s with a flurry of savage hits,
’till aeneas stops him, all “bro, that’s enough.”
dare s is half-conscious, spits teeth, gets carried off.
entellus, all dramatic, kills a bull with one punch, dedicates it to eryx.

archery contest next: a dove is tied to a mast, each guy shoots.
hippocoon hits the mast but only cuts the rope—dove flies free.
mnestheus’s arrow snaps the tether, the bird escapes.
eurytion nails the dove mid-flight. big applause.
acestes, last, shoots into the sky, and the arrow ignites in midair, leaving a fiery trail.
everyone’s shook: cosmic omen. aeneas honors acestes with a special bowl,
calls him the real winner.

time for the cavalry show: ascanius leads the trojan-lad drill.
they prance on fancy horses, weaving in labyrinth patterns, forming lines,
charging, retreating. the crowd adores it, big nostalgia.
that same “troy game” tradition ascanius brings to alba longa, then rome, etc.

but oh snap, juno’s still salty. she sends iris to rouse the trojan women,
who are stuck on the shore complaining: “we’re tired of the sea, we want a city!”
disguised as old beroe, iris stirs them up: “burn them ships, we’ll found troy right here!”
they throw torches, ships go up in flames. ascanius charges in on his horse,
shouting “why are you torching your own fleet, i’m your boi ascanius!”
the women regret it, flee. but four ships get severely scorched.
aeneas prays for help, begs jupiter, who unleashes a mega-storm,
dousing the flames. most ships are saved.

shaken, aeneas ponders: “maybe i should end the journey here,
found a trojan outpost in sicily, let the tired folks stay.”
old pal nautés is like, “yeah, pick the old, the weary, the mothers, let them settle with acestes.
you take the real trojan chads onward to italy.”
that night anchises’s ghost appears, co-signs the plan,
and also says “btw, you gotta see me in the underworld soon—
consult the sibyl in cumae, you’ll learn your destiny.”
aeneas wakes, is like “done,” organizes a new mini-troy in sicily.
the rest fix up the ships. they name the settlement “acesta.”

on the 9th day, they feast, offer final prayers, and half the trojans stay, half sail out.
aeneas does a final sacrifice to the weather gods, calls for safe winds.
venus, worried about more juno nonsense, begs neptune for safe passage.
he’s like, “sure, but i gotta take one trojan life.” – the standard deity tax.

the trojans depart, sea is calm. middle of the night, the god of sleep sneaks up on palinurus:
“yo, take a break, i got the wheel.” palinurus is like “lol no, i don’t trust these vibes.”
somnus sprinkles magic dew on him anyway, knocks him out,
and he topples overboard, gone. the ship sails on, guided by neptune’s promise.
aeneas wakes in heartbreak, mourning the loss: “palinurus, you believed too much in calm seas.
now you float alone on some foreign shore.”
