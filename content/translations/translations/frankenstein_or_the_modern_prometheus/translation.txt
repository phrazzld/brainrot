to mrs. saville, england, yo.  
st. petersburgh, dec. 11th, 17—, omg lol.  
listen fam, no cap, the startup ain’t cursed—not even one disaster crashed my vibe, even though u thought it was gonna be sus af, deadass. i just landed yesterday, yeeted right in, and first order: hit up my sis to say i’m hella good and vibin’ on success, fr fr.  
i’m chillin’ way up north from london, roaming petersburgh streets, and this icy breeze be smacking my cheeks with frosty feels that totally hype my nerves, pure joy overload, deadass. u feel that chill? this crisp breeze, comin’ straight from the frozen flex zones i’m ghosting towards, is basically a sneak peek of that arctic drip, skrrt.  
with that promise wind blowing, my daydreams go full hyper mode—vivid af like a trending tiktok gone off the rails, omg. i struggle hard to believe the pole is just cold and doom, but nah, my brain paints it as a lit paradise blastin’ beauty and endless good vibes, yeet.  
yo margaret, out there the sun is flexin’ constant, its massive glow just chillin’ on the horizon, diffusin endless epic vibes, no cap. with your vibes, sis, i’m bettin on the old navigators—where snow and frost get ghosted; and ridin’ a super chill sea, we might just float to a land that’s boss in wonders and beauty, way beyond any basic spot discovered by normies, deadass.  
its wild creations and features are straight-up one of a kind, like cosmic phenomena next level in those uncharted zones, legit mind-blowing.  
who knows what epic juju awaits in a land of eternal light? i might snag that mega power that makes compasses go wild and hack a thousand starry fixes that smooth out cosmic glitches forever, fr fr.  
i’m gonna feed my mad curiosity by exploring a part of the world no npc walked—steppin’ on fresh territory never stamped by any basic human, pure yeet into the unknown.  
that’s my hustle, fam—enough to squash any fear of danger or death. got me hyped like a kid boarding a tiny boat with his holiday mates on an epic river discovery, deadass.  
and if all my hype dreams turn out cap, still bet i’m droppin’ mad benefits on all humanz by unlocking a polar shortcut to far-off lands that nowadays take mad months to hit up; or by crackin the secret of the magnet, which only a boss move like mine can even try, no cap.

yo, these brain vibes totally chilled my jitters, and my heart’s lit like a rave, sending me high as a kite ‘cuz nothing soothes the mind like a solid mission—a target for your inner brain-ninja, deadass.  
this trip’s been my ultimate childhood flex—i soaked up books of mad voyages chasin’ that north pacific glow, defyin’ the ice corners, no cap. u probs recall uncle thomas’ entire library of epic voyage deets, his collector’s edition of wanderlust.  
my schooling was kinda wack, but i was low-key addicted to reading, grindin’ day and nite with those books, which only cranked up the regret when i found out my daddy’s last words banned my uncle from lettin’ me join the seafaring crew, major gloom.

then these wild visions ghosted when i peeped my first poets; their epic flows got my soul buzzin’ to cloud nine, and i legit became a poet—vibin’ in my own self-made utopia for a whole year; i even dreamed of snaggin a slot in the hall of fame with homer and shakespeare, y’know? u def know how hard i took that epic fail, heavy heartbreak style.  
but then—plot twist!—i copped my cousin’s fortune and suddenly my brain flipped tracks, remixin’ those old ambitions, insane level, fr.

yo, it’s been 6 wild years since i locked in on this insane quest and i still remember that epic hour when i went full beast mode, deadass.  
i kicked it off by toughin’ up hard, joining whale-fishers on savage north sea rides—voluntarily sloggin’ through cold, hunger, thirst, zero sleep; hustlin’ harder than basic sailors by day and study grindin’ math, med theory, and physical science hacks by night to flex that naval boss level, no cap.  
twice i even got hired as an under-mate on a greenland whale ship, and i legit bagged mad props—i was hella proud when the captain slid up, offering me next-level status on board and beggin’ me to stick around ‘cuz my skills were straight-up priceless, fr.

and now, yo margaret, ain’t i due for some epic flex? i could’ve cruised on cushy luxury, but glory always wins over cash, deadass. oh how i wish some hype voice would be like “bet, go get it!” i got mad courage and rock-solid resolve, but sometimes my feels do flip-outs and my mood dips, big yikes.  
i’m ‘bout to roll on a mega tough voyage where every curveball needs full beast mode—i gotta hype up others and sometimes keep my own vibe lit when the squad is low, no cap.

yo, now’s prime time to bounce ‘round russia—sledges fly like lightning over the fresh snow, super chill and honestly way better than that lame english stagecoach vibe, skrrt.  
cold ain’t too sus if u rock fur drips—i’m already rockin’ that fit, ‘cuz there’s hella diff between deck strolls and sittin’ like a statue for hours, lettin’ your blood legit freeze, oh snap.  
and i ain’t tryna yeet my life on some rickety post-road between st. petersburgh and archangel, deadass.

i’ll dip for archangel in like a fortnight or three weeks, bro; plan’s to snag a ship there by just droppin’ some insurance coin for the owner, and recruit a bunch of sailor homies with whale-fishin cred, no lie.  
i ain’t gonna set sail ‘til june; but when i bounce back? oh sis, hard to say: if i smash it, might be months or even years ‘til our next squad meetup; if i bomb, u might catch a quick re-run or, like, ghost me forever, lol.

peace out, my stellar margaret. may the cosmos rain mad blessings on u, and save me so i can keep shoutin’ thanks for all ur love and dope vibes, deadass.  
your affectionate bro,  
r. walton

letter 2

to mrs. saville, england, yo.  
archangel, 28th march, 17—, chill vibes only.  
time’s crawling like a laggy stream here, wrapped in mad frost n’ snow—total ice age throwback, omg. yet step two is in motion: i snagged a ship and am busy roundin’ up my crew; these dudes are solid NPCs with that brave boss energy, for real, deadass.

but dang, i got one savage void—i got zero true homies, margaret. when i’m glowin’ with success, there’s no one to vibe with; and if disappointment smacks me, ain’t nobody there to boost my mood, major sad af, skrrt.  
i spill my feels on paper, true, but that’s weak sauce for real emotion. i need a dude who can vibe with my feels, eyes lockin’ with mine, deadass.  
u might call me all extra and romantic, sis, but trust, i seriously crave a real friend around—someone chill yet brave, with a smart af brain and the same quirky taste to ride my wild ideas. how could someone fix the messy faults of your poor bro? i’m hella extra in my execution and super impatient when stuff gets messy, no cap.  
and bigger yikes: i’m self-taught, ran wild for the first 14 years with nothing but uncle thomas’ voyage books—so basic yet deep, icymi. back then, i got hooked on our home poets; but only when i realized i wasn’t reaping the full flex did i know i had to learn more language hacks beyond my mother tongue. now i’m 28 and, low-key, more clueless than a bunch of 15-year-old schoolkids—i might have huge daydreams, but they don’t stick, so i super need a friend who won’t roast me for being all rom-com and who’s got enough heart to help me channel my runaway brain, fr.

lol, all these rants are useless—i’m probably not gonna find a true friend on this vast ocean, not even here in archangel among merchant bros and seamen. but still, some raw feels—untainted by basic human trash—pump through these rugged chests.  
check it: my lieutenant is super brave and hustlin’, mad hyped for glory (read: leveling up his grind), pure sigma energy, deadass. he’s an english dude, and even with all that nationalist and job bias, he still holds a bag of noble human vibes, skrrt. i met him on a whale ship; saw he was outta work in this city, so i straight-up recruited him to jam with my wild enterprise, no cap.

the master dude on deck is chill af—reppin’ mad gentle vibes and soft discipline, plus his rep for integrity and brave hustle made me all in, hella desirous to lock him into the crew.  
i spent my best years alone, grown under your sweet, feminine guidance, polishing my soul so much that i straight-up hate the usual ship brutality; i never saw it as necessary. and when i peeped about this mariner known for his mega kindness and how his crew hyped him up, i felt super lucky to snag his skills, legit.  
i heard about him in a pure rom-com vibe from a chick who credits him for her glow-up—so yeah, that’s his tea in a nutshell.  
back in the day, he was all heart for a young russian girl with mid-level fortune; after stacking mad prize cash, her dad was like “yeet, ok.” but when he saw her pre-wedding, she was bawlin’, threw herself at his feet beggin’ for mercy, confessing she was into some other dude ‘cuz he was broke and her pops would never allow it—major cringe.  
my generous bro calmed her down, and once he got the tea on her boo, he immediately yeeted his chase, mad respectful, fr. he had already snatched a farm with his coin to chill for life; but then he flexed by gifting the whole setup plus his leftover prize cash to his rival, and even asked the girl’s dad to bless her marrying her crush, wild.  
but the old dude flat-out refused, claimin’ honor ties to my friend; so when my bro peeped that her pops was a hard no, he bounced from the country and ghosted till he heard his ex got hitched to someone she truly vibed with, smh.  
u’d be like “what a noble fellow!” and he def is, but he’s also mad uneducated—silent like a turk, with a clueless chill that makes his moves both wild and kinda sus, cutting down the extra sympathy he might otherwise score, no cap.

but yo, don’t get it twisted just ‘cuz i’m ranting a bit or dreamin’ up consolation for a grind that might never pay off—I ain’t wavering on my plan. it’s locked in like fate, and my voyage is only on pause till the weather flips in my favor, lol.  
winter’s been harsh af, but spring’s flexin’ early and promising, so maybe i’ll sail sooner than expected; i ain’t gonna do dumb moves—u know my vibe, always thinkin’ twice and keepin’ it safe for the squad, for real.  
i can’t even put into words the mixed feels as i stare down this epic quest—it’s like trembly hype, half lit pleasure, half mad fear, all mixed up, no cap.  
i’m bouncin’ to uncharted zones, that so-called “land of mist and snow,” and i swear, i’m not gonna yeet an albatross (for real), so don’t trip about my safety or if i bounce back lookin’ all wreck and ancient mariner vibes, deadass, lol.  
u might LOL at my reference, but here’s the secret tea: i keep sayin’ i got mad love for the perilous ocean mysteries, all inspired by the bomb drop from a super imaginative modern poet, truly vibey.  
some wild force in my soul—i don’t even know what it be—has me grindin’ hard, meticulous like a craftsman, but beyond that, there’s deep love and belief in the marvellous that slaps into all my projects, pushin’ me off the beaten path into wild seas and uncharted zones, legit.  
now, back to real feels: will i see u again after ridin’ mega seas, maybe bouncin’ back from africa’s or america’s southern tip? dunno if that’s ever gonna happen, but i just can’t face a dope ending without tryin’. keep droppin’ texts whenever, ‘cuz i might need ur letters to boost my mood when it’s in the red; i love u madly, so remember me if i’m ghosted ever, no cap.  
your affectionate bro,  
robert walton

letter 3

to mrs. saville, england, what’s good?  
july 7th, 17—, date lit af.  
yo, dear sister,  
i’m scribblin’ these quick lines to say i’m safe and cruisin’ hard on my voyage, full speed mode, deadass. this note’s ridin’ back on a merchant ship from archangel, luckier than me ‘cause i might never peep home turf for years, omg. still, my vibe’s lit: my crew’s extra bold and laser-focused, and those drifting ice sheets tryin’ to warn us of danger aren’t messin’ with their flow, they’re hype, fr.  
we’ve hit a mega high latitude, and even though it’s summer and not as fire as england, the southern winds are blastin’ us fast to those dream shores, droppin’ unexpected warm vibes that totally recharge the squad, big mood.  
so far, no wild drama for letter clout—just a couple stiff gales and a tiny leak, trivial stuff that seasoned sailors barely log; i’ll be hella content if nothing more savage goes down on this ride, sksksk.  
adios, my fab margaret. rest easy knowin’ that i won’t chase danger dumbly—for me and for u, i’m keepin’ it ice-cool, persistent, and super smart, no cap.  
but yo, success is gonna cap my hustle, why not? so far, i’ve charted a secure route through wild, empty seas, with the stars themselves hypin’ me up as witnesses to my wins—so why not push on through the rebel yet obedient elements? what can stop a heart that’s determined and a will that’s on fleek, deadass?  
my heart’s literally spazzin’ out all these feels, and i gotta wrap it up: heaven, bless my epic sis with all her aura!  
r.w., signing off with vibes eternal

letter 4

to mrs. saville, england, yo.  
august 5th, 17—, crazy date af.  
so, peep this: a wild accident just went down that i gotta spill ASAP, even though u’ll prob catch me irl before this scribble lands in ur hands, lol.  
last monday (july 31st), we got almost ice-locked—ice closed in on all sides of our ship, barely givin’ it any open sea room to flex. things were mad risky, especially ‘cuz we were wrapped in a thick, ghostly fog, fr. so we chilled and parked the ship, hopin’ the weather would flip the script, ya feel?  
around two, the mist bailed, and we peeped endless, crazy ice plains stretchin’ in every direction, like an infinite, irregular ice mosaic, deadass. some of my crew started groanin’ and my brain went on high alert with anxious feels when, outta nowhere, a weird af sight snatched our eyes, distractin’ us from our own icy drama, omg.  
we spotted a low-key ride—a carriage on a sledge, dog-drawn, cruisin’ north about half a mile away; and get this, a figure shaped like a man but totally gigantic was posted in the sledge, boss-level guiding the mutts, skkusks. we peeped his speedy flex with our scopes until he just vanished into the ice mosaic, such a vibe, omg.  
this wild look had us shook, wonderin’ mad hard. we thought we were hundreds of miles away from any actual land, but this ghostly figure hinted that maybe land was closer than we thought, big brain twist. trapped by the ice, we couldn’t tail his path even though we tracked him like pro detectives, tbh.  
like two hours later, we heard the sea rumble and before dark, boom—the ice cracked and our ship got its freedom, yeet. but we played it safe, anchored till morning, low-key scared of those huge loose ice chunks floatin’ in the dark after the breakup, so i grabbed that downtime to snooze a bit, legit nap time.  
when morning hit, i bounced up on deck and found all the sailors huddled on one side, like chattin’ with someone in the sea, wild vibes. turns out it was a sledge—same as before—that drifted toward us overnight on a giant ice chunk, lol. only one dog was still vibin’, but inside that drifting sledge there was a human, and our sailors were low-key convincin’ him to board the ship, rescue mode activated.  
get this: he wasn’t that wild traveller from some unknown island; he was actually a european, extra af, fr. when i hit deck, the master was like, “yo, here’s our captain, and he ain’t lettin’ you dip into the open sea,” straight savage captain vibes.



on perceiving me, the stranger hit me up in english, deadass, but with that extra foreign drip, yo “before i hop on board your vessel,” he spit, “can u kindly drop the deets on where u finna slide off to?”!!!

yo, i was straight-up shook when this dude on the brink of total destruction came at me with that sus q—like, i thought my ride was pure crypto treasure, not something to swap for mad clout, no cap!!! i clapped back, “nah fam, we off on a wild voyage of discovery to the northern pole, yeet!”

so peep this: upon hearing that, he was vibin’ and lowkey agreed to jump on board, like, “im in, let’s get this bread!” good god, margaret, if u had peeped the man caving for his own safety, u’d be in total shock, like endless surprise mode!!! his limbs were frozen af, his bod looked hella wrecked from mad fatigue and suffering—honestly, never seen a dude that wack, deadass. we tried hustlin’ him into the cabin, but as soon as he dipped from that fresh 4k air, he straight up fainted—instant yeet, no cap!!! so we hauled his limp self back to deck and slapped some brandy on him, forcing a lil swig down his throat, and when he started showin’ life vibes, we wrapped him in blankets and parked him by the kitchen stove chimney. slow-mo recovery activated when he even munched a little soup that brought him back, like total resurrection remix!!!

two whole days went by before he could even spit a word, and i was lowkey sweatin’, thinkin’ his sufferin’ might’ve straight-up fried his brain, deadass. when he got a bit more on deck with his words, i dragged him to my own cabin and kept it 100, lookin’ after him as much as i could manage. never seen a more lit creature: his eyes were usually off in wild, savage vibes—sometimes straight-up madness—but then if someone threw him a kindness bomb or did even the tiniest favor, his whole face lit up like a skibidi beam of pure benevolence and sweetness, unmatched in the meme hall of fame!!! yet on the reg, he was mad emo, gnashin’ his teeth like he was trynna yeet away the weight of endless woes.

when my guest was a lil revived, i legit struggled to hold off the npc dudes who were buggin’ with a thousand sus questions; i couldn’t let 'em roast his chill recovery mode, ya dig? then outta nowhere the lt dropped, “yo, why you slidin’ so far on that ice in such a wack ride?” and dude’s face turned straight to deep gloom mode, and he was like, “im out here to hunt down the one who dipped on me.” then lt popped off, “so the dude you chased also rolled like that?” and he deadass replied, “yes.” lt then went, “bet we peeped him cuz yesterday we spotted some pupper squad towing a sledge, with a man riding it, gliding across the ice.” wild, right?!

that totally lit his interest, so he went full interrogator on me about the route the “dæmon” (yeah, that’s his nickname for the dude) was on, dropping a tsunami of questions. later, when it was just us chillin’, he said, “i’ve hella juiced up ur curiosity, and even these good peeps, but u’re too chill to hound me with more q’s, right?” i was like, “fo sho, it’d be extra un-cool and totally inhuman for me to bug u with my own sus inquisitiveness, deadass.” but then he dropped, “and yet u rescued me from a wild and perilous sitch; u revived me with pure benevolent vibes.” soon after, he asked if i thought that the ice break-up had wrecked the other sledge. i was like, “dude, i can’t even tell, the ice didn’t snap till near midnight, and that traveler might’ve already yeeted to safety; idk, no solid op on that.”

from that moment, a fresh spirit of life hit his decaying frame hard—he was eager af to hit the deck and watch for that sledge comeback, but i had to convince him to chill in the cabin ‘cause he was too weak to handle that raw atmosphere energy. i promised someone would peep his vibe and hit him up ASAP if any new object popped into sight, for real.

that’s the journal on this cray occurrence so far, fam. the stranger’s health gradually leveled up, but he stayed mute and hella uneasy when anyone besides me crashed his cabin zone. yet his manners are so soft and gentle that even the sailor squad is lowkey obsessed with him, even though they barely exchange words. on the real, i’m catchin’ major brotherly feels, and his deep and constant grief fills my heart with mad sympathy and compassion. he must’ve been a noble creature in his prime, ‘cause even now, wrecked as he is, he’s still mad attractive and super amiable, real vibes.

i even slid in a letter to my girl margaret sayin’ i wouldn’t find a true friend on this vast chaotic ocean; but fr, i found a dude who, before his spirit got totally broken by misery, i would’ve been overjoyed to snatch as the brother of my heart, deadass.

i’ll keep droppin’ journal updates about this oddball stranger whenever some fresh tea pops off!!!

august 13th, 17—.

my love for my guest levels up every damn day, no cap—it hits me with mad admiration and pity at the same time, like, how can i peep such a noble soul totally wrecked by misery without catchin’ major feels of grief? he’s so gentle yet hella wise; his mind is like a curated museum of dope vibes, and when he speaks, even though his words are chosen like the finest art, they just flow rapid-fire with unmatched eloquence, straight fire, fr fr!

he’s now way better from his illness and is constantly chillin’ on deck, scoping out for that sledge that came before his own, yet even with all that unhappiness, he ain’t so consumed by his own misery that he can’t get hyped on others’ projects. he’s gone off chatting with me about my own hustle, and i spilled the deets, no filter. he locked in on all my arguments on eventual epic success and every tiny detail of the measures i took to secure that bag. i got so caught up in his sympathetic vibes that i busted out the language of my heart, droppin’ the burnin’ ardour of my soul, sayin’ how gladly i’d sacrifice my fortune, my life, and every single hope for the sake of my enterprise—like, one man’s life or death is just chump change for snatching that ultimate, sought-after knowledge and dominion over the elemental haters of our squad. as i was spittin’ this, a dark gloom spread across his face, and at first i peeped he was tryna stifle his feels; he shoved his hands over his eyes, and my voice legit quivered as i watched tears trickle fast through his fingers, then a groan burst out from his heaving chest. i paused; finally, he spoke in broken, shattered accents, “unhappy man! u vibin’ with my madness? u sippin’ on that crazy draft too? listen up; let me spill my saga, and u’ll yeet the cup from ur lips!” wild, right?!

yo, those words had my curiosity lit af; but the paroxysm of grief that gripped him totally overwhelmed his weak powers, and it took mad hours of chillin’ and deep convo to get his cool back on track.

after crushin’ that savage emotion, he lowkey started hatin’ himself for bein’ a slave to passion; then, quelling that dark despair like bad wifi, he looped me back for another deep convo bout my own life. he asked for the deets on my earlier years, and i dropped my whole life story super quick, which sparked a bunch of reflective vibes. i spilled on my deep desire to find a real ride-or-die friend, a thirst for a deeper connection with another mind than what i ever got—and i was convinced that any dude without that blessing was livin’ on a low happiness score, for real.

he then hit back, “i feel u, we’re all kinda unfinished, half-baked creatures, and if u can find someone wiser, better, and way more extra than ourselves—that’s the friend u need to help perfect our weak, glitchy selves. i once had a friend, the most noble of human beings, and so i know a thing or two ‘bout friendship. u got hope, and the world is wide open, so no need to despair. but me? i’ve lost everything and can’t even hit that reset button on life.” splash, raw feels.

as he dropped that truth, his face turned into a mellow, calm sorrow that hit me right in the feels; then, he clammed up and ghosted back to his cabin.

even though his spirit is totally broken, no one feels the beauties of nature as deep as he does—starry skies, the sea, and every epic view in these crazy regions still have the power to lift his soul from this lame earth. this dude’s got two lives rolled into one: he might drown in misery and be swept away by disappointments, but when he retreats into his inner zone, he transforms into a celestial spirit with a halo, where no grief or dumb folly can crash his vibe, all vibes only.

so, u gonna crack a smile when u peep my hype for this divine wanderer? nah, u wouldn’t if u saw him, fr. u’ve been schooled by dusty books and world exile, so u’re extra refined, and that makes u even more suited to appreciate this wondrous man’s epic merits. sometimes i’ve busted my brain tryin’ to figure out what magic sauce he’s got that elevates him so mad above any other human i ever knew—i’m talkin’ intuitive discernment, a lightning-fast and never-lame power of judgment, a deep dive into the causes of everything that’s unmatched in clarity and precision; plus, he’s got that slick expression game and a voice with such varied intonations it’s like soul-melting music, no cap.

august 19th, 17—.

yesterday the stranger dropped, “u can easily peep, captain walton, that i’ve been hit with some major, unparalleled misfortunes. i was set on letting these evil memories die with me, but u flipped my script and got me to change my mind. u’re chasin’ knowledge and wisdom just like i did once; and i seriously hope that ur wish fulfillment won’t turn into a venomous snake to sting u like mine did. i ain’t sure if my disaster drip will even help u, but when i peep that u’re on the same savage path, throwin’ urself into the same dangers that made me who i am, i bet u can snatch a killer moral from my story—a moral to guide u if u crush it, or console u if u take an L. get ready to hear some wild happenings that most folks would call marvellous. if we were in the tame parts of nature, i might fear ur disbelief or even ur roastin’ me; but in these wild, mysterious regions, anything goes and would have the uninitiated LOLing at nature’s ever-shifting powers—and trust, my tale’s got all the internal proof that these events are 100% the real deal.” 

u can totes imagine i was hella hyped by that comms drop, yet i couldn’t stomach him rehashing his grief with a nonstop saga of misfortunes, deadass. i was mad eager both outta pure curiosity and a deep desire to flip his fate if i could. i laid it out, no filter.

“i thank u,” he replied, “for ur sympathy, but it’s totes useless; my fate is almost sealed. i’m just waitin’ on that one final event, and then imma peace out for good. i feel u,” he continued, peepin’ that i was tryna interrupt, “but u got it twisted, my dude—if i may call u that; nothing can shift my destiny, no cap; just listen to my saga and u’ll see how locked it is, like, forever determined.”

then he was like, “i’ll kick off my narrative tomorrow when u’re free,” and that promise had me straight-up warmed and thankful. i vowed that every night, when i ain’t slammed with duties, i’d scribble down in his own words what deets he dropped throughout the day. if i’m slammed, imma at least jot some notes. this manuscript is gonna be pure fire for u, but for me, who truly knows him and hears it straight from his lips—with the wildest interest and sympathy, how am i even gonna vibe while reading it in some future day, lmao! even rn, as i start my journaling grind, his full-on boi voice pumps in my ears; his lit eyes stare with total melancholy sweetness; i see his skinny hand up in full animation while his face beams with that inner soul glow—strange and harrowing vibes that tell of a storm so frightful it wrecked the brave vessel on its course, like, epic wreckage!!!

chapter 1

yo, im a born genevese, no cap, and my fam’s like the top-tier squad in that republic, legit. my old fam were huge counsellors and syndics for mad years, and my pops was flexin’ in public gigs with pure honour and rep, straight up. everyone who peeped him knew he was all about integrity and that never-quit hustle on public biz. he spent his early days locked in on country affairs, and a crazy mix of sitches kept him from catchin’ a ride into matrimony until late in the game, then boom—he bagged a wifey and started the fam, fr fr.

so, peep this marriage tea that totally spills his character, cuz i gotta drop this deets. one of pops’ tightest homies was a merchant who was once ridin’ high in a booming state until a truckload of mishaps yeeted him into broke mode. this dude, beaufort, was mad proud and unbending—couldn’t stomach livin’ in poverty or fade into oblivion in the same hood he once reigned for his rank and magnificence, straight-up legend status. after payin’ off his debts in the most honourable way, he dipped with his daughter to the town of lucerne, livin’ incognito and in total wretchedness. my pops loved beaufort like a true bro and was hella grieved by his retreat into those unlucky vibes, bitterly draggin’ his friend’s false pride that made him ditch the epic bond they had. he wasted zero time hustlin’ to find him, hopin’ to convince beaufort to reboot his world with a credit glow-up and some solid assistance.

beaufort went full stealth mode, concealin’ himself so tight that it took like ten months for my pops to peep his crib. hype, right? so pop dashed to the spot, which was on a sketchy mean street near the reuss—pure adrenaline—but when he rolled in, there was only misery and straight-up despair welcome, no vibes. beaufort had managed to stash just a tiny coin pile from his fortune wreck, enough to grab some grub for a few months while he lowkey hustled for a respectable gig in a merchant’s house. meanwhile, the time was spent in mad inaction; his grief only deepened when he had the chance to overthink, and soon enough, after three months of total inactivity, he was laid up on a sickness bed, completely drained and unable to hustle.

his daughter was all tender vibes, lookin’ after him with the kindest care, but she peeped that their lil fund was vanishin’ fast and no new support was comin’ through—a major yikes moment. but caroline beaufort was next-level, with a wild, uncommon mind and guts that soared in the face of adversity. she snagged basic work—plaitin’ straw and all sorts of hustles—to pull in a scrap just enough to keep her crushin’ on life, no cap.

months rolled on, and things just got worse—her pops declined even more, her time got 24/7 locked in on him, her funds drained completely, and in the tenth month, her dad dropped cold in her arms, leavin’ her an orphan and beggar, straight heartbreaker style. that final L slammed her hard, and she knelt by beaufort’s coffin, weepin’ bitterly, when my pops burst into the chamber like a guardian spirit for this poor girl, takin’ her under his care. after buryin’ his bro beaufort, he scooped her up and bounced her over to geneva, placin’ her under the protection of a relative, real hero vibes. fast forward two years, and caroline leveled up to become his wife, legit.

my parents had a hella big age gap, but that only glued ‘em closer in ride-or-die, devoted affection. my pops had such a hot sense of justice and upright vibes that he was built to love strong AF. maybe back in the day he got wrecked by uncoverin’ that one beloved wasn’t up to par, so he learned to value true worth way more. his bond with my mom wasn’t just that old, doting fondness—it was pure gratitude and worship, inspired by mad reverence for her virtues and a deep urge to repay her for all the pain she endured, adding an inexpressible grace to all his actions toward her. everything was set up to yield to her wishes and vibes—he hustled to shield her like an exotic bloom guarded by a dedicated gardener, stoppin’ every rough wind from messin’ her up and surroundin’ her with all things that sparked good feels in her soft, benevolent heart. her health and even that rock-solid, constant spirit of hers took mad hits from all she’d been through. in the two years before they got hitched, my pops slowly dropped all his public gigs; and right after they locked in their union, they bounced to the chill, sunny climes of italy, hopin’ a change of scenery on a wonder tour would reboot her weakened vibe, straight up restorative, for real.

from italy they hit up germany and france. i, their oldest kid, was born in naples, and as a tiny bean i rolled with them on their rambles. for years, i was their one and only child, and despite how tight they were, they pulled endless stores of affection from a never-ending love mine just to shower on me. my mom’s tender caresses and my pops’ warm smile of benevolent pleasure when starin’ at me are the first memories i got, pure gold. i was their plaything, their idol, and even more—they were blessed with me, an innocent and helpless creature granted by heaven, destined to be raised right, with its future entirely in their hands to steer toward happiness or misery, based on how they fulfilled their duties. with that deep sense of what they owed to this little life they created, combined with nonstop tender vibes from both, it's like every single hour of my infant life was a lesson in patience, charity, and self-control—tied together by a silky cord that made every moment one epic train of pure enjoyment.

for like, mad eons i was their one-and-only care, deadass my mom was all like, "i needed a gurl," but i stayed locked as the sole offspring, real single flex vibes, yo!!!  
when i was like five, out there on a wild spill past italy’s borders, they hit up a week chillin’ on lake como’s shores—big mood, skrrt, pure vibes, no cap!!!  
they were always sliding into the poor folks’ cribs with that benevolent drip, and my mom was like, "this ain’t just duty, it’s a full-on necessity, a passion fueled by all my past struggles and epic come-ups"—guardian angel mode activated, on god fr fr!!!  
on one of their epic strolls, they peeped this sad af cot tucked in a vale fold, looking hella disconsolate, while a squad of half-clad kiddos gathered around screaming penury 1000x, major yikes, omg!!!  
one day, when my dad dipped solo to milan, my mom, me riding shotgun, rolled up to this crummy abode, deadass.  
she found a peasant and his wifey, total grind mode legends, bent over with care and hustle, dishing out mad skimpy grub to five starving scrub kiddos—such real struggle energy, no cap!!!  
but then, among the crew, one kid popped off as next-level; my mom was all eyes on this one rare gem, like, "yo, this one’s a whole different league!!"  
while the other four were scrappy, dark-eyed little vagabonds, this child was skinny, super fair and extra, with hair glowing like living gold—straight crown vibes despite the basic drip, yeet! her brow beamed crisp, those blue peepers were like clear summer skies, and her lips and face sculpted pure sensitive sweetness that had everyone shook, treating her like a divine, heaven-sent npc with a celestial stamp on her whole aesthetic, legit sacred flex, fr fr!!!  

yo the peasant wifey, catching my mom’s full-on wonder-look on this fine bae, dropped the tea on her backstory, no cap!!  
she wasn’t her own babe but the daughter of a milanese noble—high-key posh vibes—while her own german mama dipped after birth, so the baby got shuttled over to these dope peeps who were, like, more stable af at the time, fresh in their marriage and with a newly minted first kid, all sus but kinda lit, ya feel?  
the dude in charge, her biological pop, was one of those italians riding on antique italy nostalgia, one of those "schiavi ognor frementi" legends bustin’ moves for national freedom until his weak sauce got him wrecked—like, he mighta ghosted to austrian dungeons, who even knows, property yeeted, and his kid turned orphan and beggar, but still she bloomed with her foster fam, straight-up a garden rose flexing among dark, bramble trolls, real wildflower energy, omg!!!  

when dad boomeranged back from milan, he caught me and this lit kid playin’ in our villa hall, a babe fresher than any cherub pic, radiatin’ pure glow and floatin’ lighter than a hill chamois, pure aesthetic magic—ghost vibes explained real quick, lol!!!  
with his go-ahead, my mom yeeted her rustic guardians to hand over that sweet orphan charge, since keeping her in basic poverty was a straight-up injustice when the universe was hooking her up with powerhouse protection, fr fr!!!  
they hit up the village priest, and boom—elizabeth lavenza crashed into my parents’ pad, becoming my more-than-sis, the beautiful, adored ride-or-die companion for all my crazy occupations and endless pleasures, legit bae energy, no cap!!!

everyone was straight-up lovin’ elizabeth, mad passion and almost sacred vibes, which i soaked up as my own pride and joy. on the night before she got dropped off, my mom playfully dished, "i got a pretty present for my victor—tomorrow he’s gonna snag it," and next day when she served up elizabeth as that promised gift, i took her words in full kiddie literal mode and claimed elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish, like property on lock, deadass. every shout-out and praise felt like a claim on my very own treasure. we even called each other "cousin" like it was tight fam talk but really, no words could flex the bond—she was my more-than-sis, mine forever till the grave, period!!!

chapter 2

we were raised together, collab vibes all day, with less than a year difference in our ages—straight up NPC bonding, no disunion or petty beef ever allowed, just pure harmonious soul fusion.  
elizabeth was chill af, zen-like and concentrated, while me? i was extra, a mad machine thirsty for knowledge on hardcore intensity—like catalyst mode, on god fr fr. she spent her time followin’ those fly aerial vibes of the poets, soaking in majestic, wondrous scenes around our swiss crib—the sublime mountain shapes, seasonal glow-ups, wild storm-and-calm cycles, winter silence mixin’ with alpine summer ragers—giving her endless inspo for admiration and delight, legit sensory overload!!!  
while my ride-or-die was starin’ at the world’s epic looks with a super satisfied soul, i was busy deconstructin’ the causes behind all that glam—i wanted to decrypt the secret code of the world, curiosity blasting on full throttle with research that hit like rapture-level joy, some of the earliest feels i can even remember, fr fr!!!

when a second son was popped—my junior by like seven years—my rents binned their wanderlust and settled in the homeland, no cap. we had a house in geneva and a dope campagne on belrive, chillin’ on the east shore of the lake, like, a league away from the city’s chaos, stickin’ mostly to that countryside isolation vibe where my rents rode lowkey. me, i was all ghost mode in crowds, vibin’ only with a few—so while i was kinda indifferent to the general school mob, i clicked hardcore with one dude.  
henry clerval, son of a geneva merchant, was that singular talent, a total wonder kid who lived for enterprise, hardship, and even danger just for the sheer thrill of it, reading up on chivalry and romance like mad, droppin’ heroic songs and scribbling tales of enchantment, knightly vibes, and daring adventures. he even forced us into wild plays and masquerades with characters snatched from the legendary heroes of roncesvalles, king arthur’s round table, and that chivalrous troop who spilled blood to rescue the holy sepulchre from, like, total infidel clout—epic yeet energy!!!

no human could’ve had a happier childhood than me, no cap—my rents were straight-up angels of kindness and indulgence, never tyrants bossin’ us around but the original creators of all our dope delights. when i mixed with other fams, i peeped how peculiarly blessed my lot was, and that gratitude just built up mad filial love, real deep vibes.

i had a temper that sometimes exploded like a wild rave and passions that were hella intense, but instead of goin’ childish all over, i flipped that energy into an insane hunger for learnin’, though not in a “let’s learn everything” kinda way. real talk, language structures, government codes, and state politics were sus for me—i was all about unlockin’ the secrets of heaven and earth; whether it was the outer flex of things or the inner spirit of nature and mankind’s mysterious soul, my brain was stuck on the metaphysical grind and, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the universe, deadass!!!

meanwhile, clerval dived into the moral realness of life—he was all about life’s busy stage, heroic virtues, and real human actions, dreamin’ of joinin’ the epic squad of legends whose names echo as gallant benefactors of our species, straight sigma male grindset vibes. and then there was elizabeth, whose saintly soul lit up our peaceful crib like a shrine-dedicated lamp, always dishin’ sympathy, soft smiles, gentle voice, and that sweet, celestial glance—forever droppin’ blessings and good energy, softenin’ even my rough, heated study mood. if i was gonna be a total grump wallowing in my own intensity, she was there to chill me out with her real tenderness, yas. and clerval? damn, his noble spirit was unbreakable—he wouldn’t’ve been so lit on generosity and pure kindness in his wild adventure hunts if elizabeth hadn’t schooled him on the true loveliness of beneficence, turning doin’ good into his ultimate high-flying dream, on god fr fr!!!

i get major feels reminiscing about childhood, back before misfortune tainted my mind and flipped those bright visions of endless utility into gloomy, narrow self-reflections, so raw and tragic. plus, in droppin’ the pic of my early days, i’m spillin’ the tea on the events that slowly set off my later misery saga—tracing back to that spark of passion that later ruled my destiny like a raging mountain river, rising from lowkey, almost forgotten sources and swelling into a torrent that yeeted all my hopes and joys away, straight-up epic meltdown, omg!!!

natural philosophy was the genius that ruled my fate, so in this wild narration i gotta drop the deets that led me to fall hard for that science, deadass. when i was thirteen, we hit up a pleasure party to the baths near thonon, but the weather went all inca on us, forcing a full-day lockdown at the inn, total vibe kill, lol!!!  
inside that inn, i randomly stumbled across a volume of cornelius agrippa’s works—opened it with total apathy, then bam, his wild theory and dope facts flipped my meh mood into straight-up enthusiasm, new light leveling up my brain, so i bounced with joy to tell my dad. but he just skimmed the title page and was like, "ah! cornelius agrippa! my dear victor, don’t waste your time on this; it’s sad trash," major cringe and facepalm energy, smh!!!

if my dad had really dropped the knowledge bomb that agrippa’s old school vibes were totally busted and that modern science was slingin’ way more power than those chimerical old myths, i would have yeeted agrippa aside and pumped myself back into my old studies with even more fire—maybe never gettin’ that fatal spark that doomed me, no cap. but his half-assed glance didn’t even prove he read it, so i kept on devouring it with max intensity, thirstin’ for more, deadass!!!

when i got back home, my first move was to snag the whole works of agrippa, and then cop paracelsus and albertus magnus too—like, full collection vibes. i dove into their wild, out-there fancies with pure delight, like uncoverin’ secret treasures meant for one true connoisseur—me, obviously. i’ve always been drenched in a mad heat to unlock nature’s deepest secrets, and even with modern philosophers droppin’ insane discoveries, i always rolled out of my studies feelin’ unsatisfied, like a kid pickin’ shells beside the vast, unexplored ocean of truth, as sir isaac newton once admitted, and all his successors looked like total tyros trying to catch up on that elusive truth, no cap!!!

the untaught peasant had the practical 411 on the elements around him, and even the most scholarly peeps only knew a bit more—like they’d peeped nature’s face but her immortal glow remained a mystery, a wonder i couldn’t fully decrypt. they could dissect, name, and analyze, but final causes? Nah, those extra levels of mystery were totally off their radar. i peeped those fortifications and barriers blockin’ humans from crashing nature’s citadel, and in my rash, ignorant state, i threw major fits, full-on repining like a noob in a world of geniuses, omg!!!

but then came books and deep-dive dudes who knew way more—i took their word as gospel and became their disciple, wild af. sure, it sounds sus that this would kick off in the eighteenth century, but while i was stuck in the geneva school routine, i was self-taught most of my fave studies, grinding solo with a kid’s blindness plus a mad thirst for knowledge, since my dad wasn’t into science at all. under my new mentor squad, i dove into huntin’ the philosopher’s stone and that legendary elixir of life—but yo, the elixir snagged my whole attention. wealth was cool and all, but what epic clout would come from healin’ humanity and making man invincible to everything but a savage death, legit next-level, no cap!!!

and these weren’t my only wild visions—my fave authors promised ghost and devil summoning, and i was hella eager to nail that trick; and when my incantations flopped, i blamed my rookie moves instead of my instructors’ skills—true self-aware meltdown, lol!!! so for a hot minute, i was drowning in a crazy mash-up of a thousand clashing theories, flounderin’ like a clumsy noob in a sludge of chaotic knowledge, all powered by my fierce imagination and childish logic, until one crazy accident flipped the script and changed my whole idea stream, omg, total chaos!!!

when i was about fifteen, we crashed at our crib near belrive and then witnessed this violently wild, terrifying thunderstorm roll in from behind the jura mountains—thunder bursting out like a skibidi blast from all corners of the heavens, loud AF!!! i chilled at the door, totally riveted, watchin’ the storm’s epic progress with pure curiosity and lit delight, full on.  
standing there, outta nowhere, i peeped a stream of fire blastin’ from an old, beautiful oak just twenty yards away—like, boom, literal fire show—and as soon as that dazzle faded, the oak straight up vanished, leavin’ only a blasted stump in its wake. the next morn, when we rolled up to check the site, the tree was shattered in a truly singular way—not just splintered by shock but completely reduced to thin ribbons of wood, i swear i’d never seen anything as utterly destroyed, total 4k demolition vibe!!!

before all this, i wasn’t clueless about basic electricity laws, but on that day, a dude deep in natural philosophy was with us and, hyped by the catastrophe, dropped a fresh new theory on electricity and galvanism that was both new and mind-blowing to me—so fresh it totally threw cornelius agrippa, albertus magnus, and paracelsus (the original lords of my imagination) into the shadows, yo. yet somehow the overthrow of those old school legends made me dip from my typical studies, like nothing would ever be known again. everything that once had my brain buzzing suddenly felt utterly trash, deadass. in one of those classic early youth mind caprices, i axed my old gigs, scribbled natural history and its offsprings as a deformed, aborted creation, and dished out the utmost disdain for any wannabe science that couldn’t step up to real knowledge, so i switched gears and dove into math and its solid branches—science built on real foundations—worthy of my brutal attention, no cap!!!

thus, our souls are wired on these flimsy vibe threads that tie us to either epic prosperity or total ruin, all hinging on slight ligaments, crazy but true. lookin’ back, it feels like that near-miraculous flip of my will was straight up the guardian angel’s last flex—the spirit of preservation tryna avert the cosmic storm hangin’ in the stars ready to snatch me away. her victory shined through with a wild chill and soul-happy aura after i dumped my old tormentin’ studies, teachin’ me that evil comes with its own baggage while happiness is born from just ignoring that mess, mad deep, fr fr!!!  
but yo, even that strong spirit of good couldn’t override destiny—her immutable laws decreed my utter, terrible destruction, tragic as hell, no cap!!!

chapter 3

when i hit seventeen, my rents were like, "bro, time to level up, you’re headin’ to the university of ingolstadt," since geneva schools were basic and dad wanted me to soak up new customs beyond our native zone, deadass. my departure was set on the calendar, but before that day could even drop, the first major misfortune of my life crashed the party—an omen of the future misery that was about to go down, omg!!!

elizabeth caught that scarlet fever, and her sickness was mad severe, putting her in the ultimate danger zone, like, major risk alert. while she was wrecked, everyone argued with my mom, sayin’, "yo, don’t hover, step back," but she first bowed to our pleas—until she heard that her fave life was on the line, and then anxiety overrode all, no cap!! she manned the sickbed like a boss, her constant vigil beating that nasty distemper—saving elizabeth, but the fallout from her extra care cost her life, pure tragic plot twist, deadass!!!

on day three, my mom got hit hard herself; her fever cranked up with the most alarming symptoms, and the med squad’s looks were like, "bro, worst-case scenario incoming," for real. on her deathbed, still rockin’ unstoppable fortitude and pure kindness, she gripped elizabeth’s and my hands and said, "my children, my biggest hopes for your future happiness were riding on your union, and now that expectation will be your father’s only consolation. elizabeth, my love, you gotta step in and fill my spot for my younger kids. alas, i’m so sorry to be taken from you; though i’ve been happy and loved beyond measure, quittin’ you all is the hardest thing ever—but these aren’t vibes i wanna dwell on; i’ll try to roll into death cheerily and hold on to the hope that we’ll link up in another world," pure heart-break, on god!!!

she dipped calmly, and even in death her face dripped affection—true love vibes that never faded. i won’t even need to spell out the epic feels of having your dearest ties ripped apart by that irreparable void that slams into your soul, leaving despair writ large on your face. it takes forever for the mind to accept that the person you saw every day, who felt like a part of you, can vanish forever—that the bright sparkle of a beloved eye can dim and that a familiar, dear voice can be gone for good, never again to drop its sweet sound. these were the early days’ deep reflections, but as time showed the realness of the loss, the true bitterness of grief slashed in hard. honestly, who hasn’t had that rude hand snatch away someone cherished? why spill sorrow that every soul’s gonna feel? eventually, grief becomes more a treat than a necessary pain, and that cheeky smile on your lips—even if some call it sacrilege—just won’t disappear. my mom was dead, but we still had responsibilities to grind on; we had to keep cruising with life and learn to count ourselves lucky as long as somebody wasn’t snatched by the spoiler, for real!!!

my departure for ingolstadt, like, was postponed bc of those cray events, deadass, but now i was rly set to yeet out 2 that town lol fr, got a chill breather from my dad for a few weeks, ya feel me? but yo, it felt sacrilegious 2 dip so soon from that sleepy, deathlike mourning crib and then rush headfirst into the wild, thick of life, i was hella new to sorrow and mad shook by it, fr fr, and i lowkey couldn’t leave my squad behind, especially not without seeing my sweet elizabeth get some consoling vibes, smh

she, like, totally masked her grief and was out here tryna be the ultimate comforter 4 all our feels, staying solid on life with mad courage and zeal, dedicating herself 2 her uncle and cousin crew like it was her side hustle, and never did she glow up more than then when she threw on that sunshine smile energy all over us, even ghostin her own regrets just 2 make us forget our own mid feels, deadass

so the day of my sendoff finally popped off, and clerval hung with us the last night, lowkey trying 2 convince his dad to let him squad up and roll with me as my study bro, but nah fam his pops was such a narrow trader, seeing nothing but idleness and ruin in clerval’s wild dreams, and dude’s eyes, though, were lit with a silent, firm “i ain’t gettin’ chained 2 commerce BS” vibe, legit

we sat up super late, like, too tight 2 even think bout dropping a “farewell!” vibe, neither of us could ghost each other, so we dipped under the fake pretense of chillin 2 catch some z’s while both knew the other was totally bamboozled; then at morn, i bounced 2 my carriage – and omg, there they all were: my dad comin’ in strong with his blessings, clerval squeezin’ my hand 1 last time, and my bae elizabeth out here beggin’ me 2 text on the reg and showering her last femme vibes on her playmate, deadass

i yeeted myself into the chaise 2 roll out and got hit with the heaviest, most gloomy feels ever, like, me who used to be surrounded by bomb company and always tryna spread mutual pleasure, suddenly lone AF – in the uni i was headed 2, i had 2 build my own crew and be my own protector, comin’ from a super cozy, domestic zone that left me way repulsed 2 face new faces, cuz i loved my bros, bae elizabeth, and clerval – my old familiar faces – but yo, i was totally unfit 4 random noobs on the scene

such were my deep feels as i set off on my journey, but damn, as i cruised, my mood and hopes leveled up hardcore, and i was wildin’ in desire 2 snag that knowledge flex; like, all my days at home felt like being cooped up and i was craving to bounce into the real world and park myself among other human beings, so now my dreams were lit and it’d be pure foolishness 2 regret this epic move, no cap

my brain had mad time 2 drown in reflections on that long, draggy ride 2 ingolstadt, and eventually, i peeped the high white steeple smacking into my view like a neon sign, so i hopped off and got herded 2 my solo crib 2 flex the evening on my own terms, yo

the next morn, i dropped my intros and slid over 2 meet some top profs, and get this—chance, or better yet that evil energy vibe (the angel of destruction squad, if u will) that’s been bossin’ me since i stepped off my dad’s door, led me first 2 m. krempe, the rough-and-ready prof of natural philosophy, a total uncouth dude but mad deep into his science secrets, askin’ a bunch of questions bout my progress in all these science branches; i answered all extra carelessly and with low-key contempt, droppin’ names of my alchemist heroes like they were the only legends i peeped, and then krempe just stared like “yo, you seriously wasted your time studying that trash?” and i was like, “every single minute, bro, every moment wasted on that cap is totally lost, clogging up my brain with exploded systems and useless names – goddamn, where u even live? in some dusty desert where no one tells u that these ancient fancies are like 1000 yrs old and mad musty? i lowkey didn’t expect a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus in this woke, science age, so dude, start ur studies from scratch, fr fr” then, stepping aside, he scribbled a lit list of natural philosophy books i had 2 snag and dropped that next week he was kickstarting a lecture course on the subject, and his boy m. waldman would drop chem bombs on alternate days when he was MIA, smh

i bounced back home, not even disappointed, coz i’d already dissed those authors krempe trash-talked; still, my vibe wasn’t 2 be drawn back 2 those studies in any shape, cuz m. krempe was this squat dude with a gruff voice and repulsive mug, so the teacher vibe didn’t sync for me; honestly, in a too philosophical haze i’d already spilled mad tea on my early conclusions: as a kid, i wasn’t vibin’ with the whack modern natural science profs – i was all mixed up with ideas only explainable by my extreme youth and zero guide, retracing the time-warp steps of knowledge and swapping fresh discoveries for the dusty dreams of old alchemists, plus i had a full-on diss for modern natural philosophy – way different when the science bosses chased immortality and power, even if those aims were kinda doomed yet epic, but now the scene had flipped so that the inquirer’s hustle was just about nuking the visionary vibes i clung to – like, trading out epic, boundless chimeras for lowkey, meh realities

so those were my deep drip thoughts during the first 2-3 days in ingolstadt, mostly spent scopin’ out the new hood and major peeps in my crib; but then as week2 dropped, i kept reppin’ krempe’s lecture deets, and even though i lowkey wasn’t down 2 watch that conceited dude spit sentences from a pulpit, i peeped his rave on m. waldman – who, btw, i’d never seen ‘round since he’d been ghostin’ town

partly cuz i was straight-up bored and partly cuz curiosity was on fleek, i vibed into the lecture room, and soon m. waldman strolled in. this prof was a whole other mood – looked like a chill 50-year-old with max benevolence, sporting a few grey temple strands while his back-head stayed jet black, short but prouder than a gigachad, and his voice? sweetest drop i ever heard. he kicked off his lecture with a lit recap of chem’s history, droppin’ names of epic discoverers with mad fervour, then skimmed the current state of chem and broke down basic terms, ran a few quick experiments, and closed with a straight-up panegyric for modern chem that i’ma never forget:

"yo, the ancient teachers of this science promised wild impossible dreams but delivered nada, but the modern masters, they keep it 100; they know metals ain’t gonna morph 2 gold and the elixir of life is just a wild cap, yet these lab homies – whose hands look made 2 play in dirt and eyes glued 2 the microscope or crucible – have pulled off legit miracles, diving deep into nature’s secret zones and flexing how she hides her real sauce, even rising 2 the heavens, breaking down how blood circulates and the vibe of the air we breathe; they’ve unlocked insane, almost limitless powers, commanding thunder like gods, mimicking quakes, and even clapping back at the invisible world by using its own shadows, deadass!"

so like, bro, his words hit me like fate itself was throwing down a savage challenge 2 destroy me, each key smacked my inner mechanism, chord after chord ringing out, and soon my brain was lit 2 1 epic thought, 1 solid mission: "so much is done, but i’m just gettin’ started; more, hella more will i achieve; follow the already marked steps? nah, imma pioneer a whole new path, explore uncharted powers, and drop the deepest, most extra creation mysteries on the world," like, pure frankenstein soul energy, no cap

i didn’t close my eyes that night, yo, my insides were in full-on revolt and chaos, like an unhinged rager with zero power 2 bring order, and slowly after dawn, sleep sneaked in – i woke up feeling like last night’s thoughts were just a trippy dream, leaving me with only one savage resolution: bounce back 2 my old studies and commit 2 a science i knew i was naturally lit for, fr. later that day, i swung by m. waldman’s spot – his private chill was even mad smoother than his lecture game, where that dignified aura flipped into total affability and kindness; i laid out nearly the same tea about my past hustles as i did for krempe, and he listened real close to my lowkey story about my studies, smilin’ at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus without any of krempe’s disgust, and then he went, "yo, these dudes, with their tireless hype, gave modern philosophers the base of their knowledge – they left us an easier job: rename and link the discoveries they helped light up; even if genius labors went off track, they almost always flip it to mankind’s solid gain," and i soaked in his words, delivered with zero affectation, and then admitted that his lecture totally zapped my beef against modern chem heads; i kept it chill and humble like any youth should respect his teacher, not spilling any of that raw excitement that fueled my grind, and i asked straight up for his advice on which books i needed 2 cop

m. waldman clapped back, "i’m hella happy 2 have gained a disciple; if your hustle matches your raw ability, success is a lock, on god. chemistry is that sick branch of natural philosophy where the biggest glow-ups have happened and still can, which is why i made it my main jam; but i ain’t dissed the other science lanes – cuz honestly, you’d be a super lame chemist if you only stuck 2 that lane. if you wanna truly be a science boss and not just some petty experimenter, you gotta dive into every branch of natural philosophy, including maths, no cap." 

then he led me into his lab, showin’ off his crazy machines and breakin’ down what gear i should snag, promising me full lab access once i leveled up enough to not wreck his setups, then dropped the list of books i’d asked for, and i peaced out

so that day, unforgettable as heck, sealed my future destiny, fr

chapter 4

from that day on, natural philosophy – and especially chemistry – became my one true hustle, yo; i was devouring those genius-packed, hella discerning works penned by modern brainiacs on the subject, hitting up lectures and rubbin’ elbows with the uni’s science squad, and even found some serious, sound info in m. krempe (despite his mad repulsive look and manners) that still held value, but in m. waldman i found a real ride-or-die, a true friend – his chill was free of any dogmatic BS, and his instructions came off so frank and good-natured that all pedantic illusions got yeeted away; in a thousand ways, he paved my knowledge highway, breakin’ down those super abstruse questions into chill, digestible vibes, deadass. my grind was shaky at first, but then it powered up so hard that even the stars seemed to vanish in the morning light while i was still locked in my lab hustle

as i got in so deep, my progress went off the charts – my fire lit up the room so much that the other students were shook and even the masters gave me mad props; prof krempe would sneak a sly grin askin’ how cornelius agrippa was holdin’ up, while m. waldman was out here full heart stanning my progress, real talk. two years rolled by like that, and i didn’t even dip back 2 geneva, too busy, heart and soul, pursuing some next-level discoveries i dreamed of droppin. only those who’ve been in the science grind know how insanely enticing it is – in most studies u just remix what’s been done, but in science, the buffet of discovery is endless, pure wonder fuel, fr. a mind fixated on one study always hits boss level, and i, who was 100% locked on one epic quest, leveled up so fast that by the end of 2 years i had upgraded some chem instruments, snaggin’ mad clout and respect at the uni; and when i got so lit on natural philosophy theory and practice from all my ingolstadt profs, my crib there just wasn’t cut out 4 more glow-ups, so i was ready 2 bounce back 2 my home turf – until a wild incident snagged my stay

one phenomenon had me totally trippin’ – the structure of the human bod and any animal that’s live, like, where does that life spark even come from? a bold, unanswered question that’s always been a major mystery, yet we’re so close 2 unlocking a bunch of secrets if we ain’t too chicken or careless; so i twisted it in my brain and decided 2 dive hardcore into those natural philosophy branches that vibe with physiology, cuz unless you got that almost supernatural hype, studyin’ this stuff would be a major snooze fest, almost intolerable, deadass. to peep the causes of life, u gotta first roll with death – so i got into anatomy, but that ain’t enough, you gotta check out the natural decay and straight-up corruption of the human frame. my dad made sure my brain wasn’t filled with supernatural horror BS, so i never remember freakin’ out over ghost tales or spooky apparitions, coz darkness was just background noise and a graveyard was simply a dump 4 bodies that once had all that beauty and strength but are now just grub 4 worms, lol. then i had to examine the whole decay game, spending days and nights in creepy vaults and charnel houses – my eyes were glued 2 every gross detail that would normally wreck the sensitive human feels, peepin’ how man’s prime form got totally degraded and wasted, watching death take over the blooming cheek of life, and seein’ worms inherit the dope wonders of eyes and brains, smh. i paused to analyze every micro-detail of the switch from life 2 death and back, until suddenly, outta that deep darkness, a blinding light hit me – a light so simple yet insanely brilliant that it made my head spin with the vastness of the vibe, and i was mad shocked that among all the genius peeps digging into the same science, i was the lucky one chosen 2 uncover such a wild secret

yo, no cap, i ain’t spittin’ the ramblings of a madman – the sun still shines up high and what i’m sayin’ is on the level, deadass. maybe some miracle sparked it, but every step of this discovery was straight-up legit, and after days and nights of next-level grind and exhaustion, i finally cracked the code to generation and life; nah, i even leveled up so i could literally bring dead matter 2 life, fr fr

the shock i caught on this discovery quickly flipped into pure delight and ecstatic rapture – after all that pain and grind, slam-dunking the summit of my dreams was the sweetest pay-off ever, so much so that every tiny step i took got totally erased, leaving only that epic result; what had long been the dream of the wisest since the dawn of time was now in my grasp, fr, not like it all magically dropped 2 me in one shot, but the info i snagged was more like a boss roadmap guiding my hustle rather than flashing the final product, deadass. i was like that arabian dude who got buried with the dead and then found a secret passage 2 life, powered by just a weak, flickering light that turned into his ultimate comeback

yo, i peep the eagerness and that glitter of wonder and hope in your eyes, my friend, like u’re expectin’ me 2 spill that ultra-secret sauce i discovered; but nah, i’m not about 2 drop that deets yet; just hang tight 2 the end of my saga and u’ll see why i keep that subject on lockdown, coz i sure as heck ain’t tryna lead you, unguarded and wild like i used 2 be, straight 2 destruction and unstoppable misery, fr. learn from my epic example, if not my preachin, that the pursuit of knowledge is rly dangerous, and how much happier a dude is if he just vibes in his hometown than chasin’ to be more than his natural self will ever allow, deadass!

when i found this insane, mad powerful juice in my hands, deadass, i was like “hold up, bruh” and chilled for a hot minute tryna decide how to flex it, yo; i had that wild ability to yeet life into dead matter, but prepping that crazy framework with all its gnarly fibres, muscles, and veins was a next-level grind full of inconceivable difficulty and lowkey headache—big yikes, no cap. i even dipped in doubt: should i try cloning a me-version or drop a simpler build? but my brain was riding high on that first epic success, too hyped to question if i could spark life into a beast as complex and lit as a human, deadass. the raw materials in my stash looked mad weak for a quest so hardcore, yet i was like “trust the process”—someday, i’d yeet it all, for real. i braced myself for a swarm of reversals; my ops might glitch nonstop and maybe my masterpiece would come out hella imperfect, yet watching science and tech level up every day fueled my hope that my crazy attempts would drop the base for future boss vibes. i couldn’t even peep the massive, intricate plan as an excuse to bail—nah fam, it was pure hustle. so with these wild feels, i dove into creating a human, yo. since the teeny-tiny parts messed with my speed like a laggy server, i flipped the script and decided, contrary to my OG plan, to build a gigantic, mega flex being—like roughly eight feet tall and proportionately massive. after locking down that decision and spending mad months scavenging and stacking my materials like loot in a glitch dungeon, i finally got to work.

yo, no mortal can even fathom the cray mix of feels that blasted me forward like a hurricane in the epic high of success. life and death were total boundaries i was determined to break through, pouring a torrential blast of light into our super dark world, skrrt. a fresh, next-level species would straight-up bless me as its creator and source; a whole squad of happy, epic souls would owe their very vibe to me, big chad energy. no dad could ever snag that full, all-out gratitude from his kid like i was destined to score, deadass. riding those thoughts, i figured if i could activate lifeless matter, maybe i could eventually reboot life where death had ghosted its duty and left the body to rot—mad scientist vibes, on god fr fr.

these wild brainwaves totally boosted my spirit while i was grindin’ with non-stop, neurotic ardour, like an unhinged sigma male vibe—my face turned ghostly pale from non-stop study and my body got all skinny from being trapped in my own dungeon. sometimes, riding the brink of certainty, i totally fumbled; still, i clung to that hope that the next hour or next day might drop a dope win. i held a secret hope, my own spicy sauce that only i knew about, dedicating every fiber of my meme-filled mind to it; even the moon was lowkey watching my midnight labors while i chased nature’s hidden easter eggs with breathless, unrelaxed energy. who the heck could even imagine the horrors of my dank, secret grind—dabbling in the cursed, unholy damp of the grave or straight up torturing a living critter just to fire up some clout in dead clay? my limbs were shaking like my phone on 1% battery and my eyes were drowning in cringe remixes; but then a wild, almost frantic impulse shoved me forward, and i was so zoned in that i lost all feels except that one lit mission. it was a passing trance, fam, that only made me feel extra every time that wack unnatural spark ghosted away and i slid back into my old glitch-mode.

i went full savage, collecting bones from charnel-houses and messing with the epic secrets of the human frame using my profane, uncensored fingers, like a madcap scavenger in a horror game. in my dank, solitary chamber—or should i say cell—perched at the very top of the crib and cut off from all the other spots by a gallery and staircase maze, i set up my filthy, off-the-hook creation workshop; my eyeballs were practically sliding out of their sockets tryna catch every detail of my mad employment. the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse were my ultimate hardware stores for body parts, and even though sometimes my human feels recoiled in absolute loathing from such a grim grind, an ever-increasing, uncontrollable eagerness kept me hustling till my work nearly dropped its final boss level status.

the summer months passed while i was hella locked into this one insane mission, heart and soul, all in. it was a most bomb season—fields were dropping mad harvests and vines were poppin out that lush vintage, yet my eyes were so numb to nature’s drip, i couldn’t even peep their charms. and the same hyper-focused aura that made me ghost all the killer scenes around me also had me totally forgetting my squad who were mad distant and whom i hadn’t seen in ages; i knew my radio silence was bugging them, and i still heard my pops drop that old-school truth: “i know that while you’re vibing and feelin’ yourself, you’ll still think of us with some affection, and we’ll catch your updates on the regular. if there’s an interruption in your messages, i’m gonna see it as you slackin on your other duties, yo.”

i was like, yo, i totally peeped how my dad would feel, but i couldn’t even pry my brain away from this nasty hustle—ugly as it was, it had taken an unstoppable hold on my imagination. i straight up wanted to push off all the lovey-dovey feels until that mega project swallowed every bit of my nature and was finally finished, deadass.

i even thought that my old man would be extra harsh if he called my neglect a vice or some clown fault, but i’m now lowkey convinced he was right in thinking i wasn’t totally clear of blame. a perfect human should always stay chill and zen, never letting fleeting passion or a random desire mess with that inner peace. and yo, the chase for knowledge isn’t an exception, no cap. if your deep dive into study turns you into a vibe-killing, emotion-wiped bot that can’t appreciate the small joys where no extra metal or plastic is mixed in, then that grind is straight-up sketch—unlawful and not even fit for a genuine human brain, fr fr. if everyone kept it all zen and no one let any hustle break their homey feels, then greece wouldn’t have been enslaved, cæsar would’ve spared his hood, america would’ve dropped more slowly, and the empires of mexico and peru wouldn’t have totally crashed, deadass.

lol but real talk, i was going full-on moralizing mode in the dopest part of my saga, and your vibe told me, “yo, keep it movin’.”

my pops didn’t throw no shade in his letters—he just peeped my ghost mode by asking more deets about my hustle than before. winter, spring, and summer all ghosted by while i was deep in my lab grind; i wasn’t out there vibing with blooming flowers or checking out that epic leaf drip, which used to fill me with supreme joy, 'cause i was so locked in. that year’s leaves withered long before my creation was nearly wrapped up, and every day i was hit with proof of how sick my success was, yet my enthusiasm got nerfed by anxiety; i ended up looking like someone sentenced to eternal mining or some other gnarly, unwholesome hustle instead of an artist living his dream grind. every night, my nerves got slammed by a slow fever, i was jittery to the max—like even a leaf’s descent would freak me out—and i ghosted people as though i’d committed some horrible glitch crime. sometimes, i peeped that i’d become a total wreck, but only my relentless purpose kept me juiced: my grind was almost over, and i was betting that a dose of exercise and a splash of fun would yeet away the looming sickness; i even promised myself both when my creation dropped.

chapter 5

it was on a dreary, wonky november night when i peeped the climax of my mad toils, anxiety cranked up to near agony mode, as i gathered all the life instruments around me ready to inject a spark into that dead, lifeless lump at my feet. it was already one in the morning—rain tapping its sad beat against the panes and my candle almost ghosted out—when, through the half-killed glow, i spotted the creature’s dull yellow eye pop open; it was breathing hard, and its limbs were twitchin’ in a wild, convulsive frenzy, like total glitch mode.

yo, how do i even vibe describe the tidal wave of feels at this catastrophic moment, or break down the cringeworthy wretch i painstakingly built with endless pain? his limbs were on point, and i’d handpicked his features to be straight-up beautiful—beautiful, i repeat, no cap! great god, his yellow skin barely masked the epic work of muscles and arteries underneath; his hair was that silky, jet-black flow, his teeth shined pearly white—yet all that extra drip only clashed with his watery, glitch eyes that nearly matched the dun-white sockets they were set in, along with his shriveled complexion and straight, black lips, turning him into an absolute horror remix.

like, life’s random mishaps aren’t even close to the crazy changeability of human feels. i had been on a two-year grind, straight-up hustling to plug life into an inanimate body, sacrificing sleep and health on the altar of my wicked obsession. i craved it with such a wild passion beyond moderation; but once i finished, the dreamy beauty straight-up vanished, replaced by bone-chilling horror and deep disgust flooding my heart. unable to stomach the sight of my own creation, i bolted out the room and wandered my bedchamber for what felt like forever, my mind so jacked up it couldn’t even clock sleep. eventually, exhaustion overpowered the chaos, and i flopped onto my bed in my clothes, desperately chasing a few minutes of oblivion. but nah, it was all in vain; i did sleep, but my brain got invaded by the wildest, freakiest dreams. i swear, i saw elizabeth, all vibrant and healthy, strolling through the streets of ingolstadt. overjoyed and totally surprised, i grabbed her, but the moment i planted that first kiss, her lips morphed to a deathly livid hue; her features twisted, and i swear i was holding the corpse of my dead mother in my arms—a shroud wrapped her up tight while grave-worms crawled in the folds of her flannel. i jerked awake in pure horror; cold sweat drenched my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb convulsed crazy—then, by the dim, yellow moonlight squeezing through the shuttered window, i faced that wretched, miserable monster i’d created. he hauled up the bed’s curtain and fixed his eerie, glitch-eyes on me; his jaw dropped and he muttered inarticulate, garbled sounds while a creepy grin spread across his face. he might’ve tried to talk, but i couldn’t catch a word; one skeletal hand shot out like it was tryna grab me, but i busted out and dashed downstairs. i took refuge in the courtyard of my crib, pacing up and down the night in a frenzy, ears tuned to catch every sound like it was the prelude to a demonic corpse creeping back to life—so damn tragic.

oh my god, no human could survive that nightmarish countenance. even a mummy, reanimated for kicks, wouldn’t be as hideous as that glitch wretch i created. i’d peeped him while he was unfinished—ugly as hell back then—but once his muscles and joints got that motion upgrade, he turned into a creation so monstrous that even dante couldn’t have fathomed it.

i spent the night in utter wreck mode. sometimes my heart pounded so fast i felt every artery thump, and other times i was on the brink of collapsing from pure exhaustion and weakness. mixed in with the horror was this bitter overdose of disappointment; dreams that once fed me and gave me chill vibes turned into an absolute hellscape—such a rapid flip, the entire vibe overthrown like a busted meme!

morning, all dismal and soaked, finally broke and revealed to my sleepless, aching eyes the ingolstadt church with its stark white steeple and clock declaring the sixth hour. the porter swung open the courtyard gates—which had been my refuge last night—and i stormed out into the streets, strutting at a mad pace like i was dodging that wretched ghost that i feared might jump out at any turn. i didn’t dare even swing by my apartment, compelled instead to keep movin’ despite being drenched by rain pouring from a dark, comfortless sky.

i kept on cruising like this for a minute, using all that physical hustle to try and ease the heavy load on my mind. i wandered the streets without a clue where i was or what damn i was doin’, my heartbeat thumping in a fear-induced frenzy as i trudged along with erratic steps, too shook to even glance around, pure terror vibes:

like one who, on a lonely road,  
doth spaz in fear and dread,  
and, after one quick glance, slides on,  
never peepin’ back his head;  
‘cause he knows a spooky fiend  
is creepin’ up real close, deadass ahead.

rolling on, i finally ended up right across from an inn where all sorts of diligences and carriages usually pull up. i paused for a hot minute, not even sure why, and kept my eyes glued on a coach sliding in from the far end of the street. as it drew closer, i clocked that it was the swiss diligence; it pulled up dead on where i was chillin’, and when the door swung open, i peeped henry clerval jump out instantly, yelling, “my dear frankenstein, how stoked i am to see you! how lit that you popped up exactly as i was droppin’ off!”

no cap, nothing could top my hype on seeing clerval; his arrival hit different, sparking memories of my dad, elizabeth, and all those homey scenes that used to fill me with pure nostalgia. i grabbed his hand and, in a split second, all my horror and bad juju vanished, replaced by a sudden, first-time-in-ages calm, serene joy. i welcomed my friend with full, warm vibes and we bounced toward my college. clerval kept on talkin’ for a minute about our mutual crew and how insanely lucky he was to get permission to roll into ingolstadt. “you can bet,” he said, “how hard it was to convince my dad that all the essential knowledge wasn’t just wrapped up in the noble art of book-keeping; i even left him totally incredulous right till the end, his constant reply to my never-ending requests was just like that dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield sayin’, ‘i got ten thousand florins a year without greek, i chow down heartily without greek.’ but eventually, his love for me outshined his hating on learning, and he let me head off on a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”

“yo, it’s mad lit to see you; but spill, how did you leave my dad, my bros, and elizabeth?”

“i’m gravy, all good and happy, just lowkey buggin’ that they don’t hit you up much. oh and btw, i got a mini lecture on them comin’ up. but yo, my dear frankenstein,” he continued, coming close and locking eyes with me, “i didn’t peep before, but you look hella ill—so thin and pale, like you’ve been pulling all-nighters for days.”

“you nailed it; i’ve been super deep in this one grind so i haven’t clocked enough sleep, as you can see; but i seriously hope that this whole marathon of work is over and that i’m finally free, on god.”

i was shakin’ hardcore, couldn’t even think ‘bout or mention the freaky events of last night, so i picked up the pace and we soon hit my college. then a shiver-of-dread hit me—i realized that the creature i left lurking in my apartment might still be there, alive and roaming around. i was straight-up terrified to peep that monster, but even more, i was shook that henry might spot him. so i begged henry to chill at the bottom of the stairs for a few minutes while i dashed up to my room. my hand hit the door lock before i even managed to think, then i paused as a cold shiver slammed through me; i flung the door open like a kid expecting a ghost to be waitin’ on the other side, but nada—nothing was there. i stepped in all jittery; the apartment was totally empty and my bedroom had no trace of that hideous guest. i could barely believe such epic luck had dropped on me, but once i was sure my enemy had yeeted, i clapped my hands in pure joy and raced back down to clerval.

we bounced back into my room, and the servant rolled in breakfast in no time; but i was so amped, i couldn’t keep it together. it wasn’t just joy—I felt my skin tingle with an overload of sensitivity, and my heart was pounding like crazy. i couldn’t sit still for even a sec; i was leaping over chairs, clapping my hands, and laughing out loud like a total maniac. clerval at first pegged my wild energy as pure joy at his arrival, but when he scoped me out closer, he saw a crazy, untamed wildness in my eyes he couldn’t even decode, and my loud, unfiltered, almost heartless laughter straight-up freaked him out, leaving him shook and astonished.

“yo my dear victor,” he cried, “what the actual fuck is goin on? don’t be laughin like that, for god’s sake. you look hella ill! what’s causin all this madness?”

“don’t even ask me,” i shrieked, covering my eyes like, no way, ‘cause i thought i peeped that dreaded spectre glidin’ into the room; “he’ll spill the tea. oh, help me! save me!” i pictured that monster snatchin’ me up; i fought like crazy then totally crashed in a fit.

poor clerval, fr—what savage feels he must’ve ridden through! our meetup, once mad hyped with joy, flipped into bitter, toxic vibes. but i wasn’t around to witness his despair, ‘cause i was straight-up zonked out, lifeless, and it took ages for me to get back to reality.

this was the kickoff of a next-level nervous fever that had me locked down for months, yo. throughout that rough spell, henry was my one and only nurse, ride-or-die. later, i found out that knowing my dad was ancient and totally unfit for long journeys—and how much my sickness would mess up elizabeth—henry kept it on the down-low, sparing them from my major grief by hiding the full extent of my breakdown. he knew no one could ever be a kinder, more extra attentive nurse than him; and riding high on hope for my recovery, he was deadass convinced that, instead of doing harm, he was dishing out the kindest vibes possible to them.

but real talk, i was super sick, and nothing but the unbounded, non-stop care from my homie could’ve yeeted me back to life. the image of that monster i’d birthed was forever looping in my brain, and i raved about him like a broken record. sure enough, my nonstop rambling shocked henry; at first he pegged it as just my messed-up imagination runnin’ wild, but my relentless fixating on the same subject convinced him that my disorder really stemmed from some off-the-charts, terrible event.

slowly, like glacially with mad relapses that left henry shook to his core, i started recovering. i remember the first time i could actually vibe with the world outside—i peeped that all the dead leaves had ghosted and that fresh buds were poppin’ off the trees shading my window, like a divine spring dropping epic vibes. the season was a straight-up miracle for my convalescence; warm feels of joy and affection started pumpin’ back into my chest, my gloom evaporated, and before long i was as lit and cheerful as i was pre-that fatal passion onslaught.

“dearest clerval,” i shouted, “you are so incredibly kind and good to me. this entire winter, instead of crushing it with study like you planned, was swallowed up in my sick room—pure wasted time. how can i ever pay you back? i feel mad remorse for the epic letdown i caused, but please, forgive me.”

“you’ll repay me if you don’t lose it completely and just get well as fast as you can; and since you’re vibin’ all high-key right now, may i drop one subject on you?”

i was shakin’ like crazy—one subject, really? what the hell could it be? like, is he gonna ghost-drop a mention of that dreaded thing i’m too scared to even think about, deadass?

yo, get your sh*t together, clerval snapped, noticing my vibe glitching like a busted screen, "i ain't gonna spill tea if it triggers u; but your pops and cuz would be hella stoked if they got a handwritten letter from u, deadass. they got no clue how wrecked u been and are lowkey stressing over your ghost-mode silence, fr fr."

omg, my dear henry, u tryna say my first thought wouldn’t yeet straight to my ride-or-die squad? like, how could u even think that, smh, they’re my ultimate crew, no cap.

if u still rockin that cray mood, my friend, bet u gonna vibe hard with a letter that’s been chillin here for days; it’s from ur cuz, deadass, for real.

chapter 6

clerval slid me this hot leak of a letter, and omg, it’s straight from my bae elizabeth, legit.

yo, what’s up cuz,

u been mad sick, like seriously ill, and even henry’s nonstop texts ain’t enough to vibe me up on all the deets of ur savage breakdown, no cap. u’re banned from scribbling—like, free pen mode is totally off limits; but one word from u, dear victor, is the clutch move to chill our anxiety squad, on god fr fr.

i been waiting for ages, expecting every post to drop that fire line, and i even lowkey convinced my boomer uncle not to yeet on a wild road trip to inglostadt, dodging all those sketchy hazards. real talk, how many times did i wish i could’ve handled it myself, omg regret overload, kskdhf!!!

tbh, caring for u turned into a shady gig with some bargain-bin nurse who got zero clue about ur drip or wishes—unlike your loyal cuz. but yo, clerval just spilled that u’re on the up, so drop a line in that own clout handwriting ASAP cuz we stan your recovery vibes, deadass!

feel better and slide back to our crib stat, cuz u got a lit fam here dripping mad love. yo dad’s flexing healthy af and just wants to peep u to know u’re aight, no drama—his benevolent mug ain’t ever gonna flip, i promise. and btw, imagine how hyped u’d be to peep our boy ernest leveling up! he’s now 16, buzzing with energy and spirit, tryna be a true swiss boi and jump into foreign service, but we gotta keep him on lock until his big bro bounces back. my uncle’s all extra about the military career in some far-off land, but ernest just ain't about that study life—he’s out here climbing hills, rowing on the lake, living that fresh air flex, lol. unless we let him rock his chosen gig, he might just go full idle mode, no cap.

not much changed here except our kiddos leveling up; the blue lake and that snow-clad mountain backdrop? still eternal, unchanged like a glitch in the matrix. our chill home and contented hearts are on some unbreakable, immutable vibe, fr fr. my lil side hustles keep me busy and shower me with nothing but rad, kind faces everywhere—pure heartwarming memes. btw, since u dipped, only one remix dropped in our cozy fam-house: remember when justine moritz crashed our squad? bet u don’t, so imma spill her tea real quick, deadass.

madame moritz, her mom, was a widow with four kiddos, and justine was the third kid, lowkey the fav of her dad, but her mom was straight-up extra and couldn’t stand her—like, major cringe. after mr. moritz peaced out, she treated justine like the worst, smh. my aunt peeped the drama, and when justine hit 12, she lowkey strong-armed her mom to let her crash at our pad. our republican vibes here are so lit compared to those clown monarchy feels out there; there’s way less class drama, so even the lower orders got refined, moral drip. a servant in geneva is a whole vibe, not like a basic servant in france or england. justine, welcomed into our fam, learned the servant hustle—here it ain't about being ignorant or sacrificing your human dignity, deadass.

real quick, justine—you probs remember, she was always a mega fav; i even recall u dropping that one line, like if u were in a bad mood, just one glance from justine could yeet it away, kinda like ariosto hyping up angelica’s fresh vibe—so real and all-out happy. my aunt got mad attached to her and even leveled up her education to way beyond what was planned, and omg, the ROI was 100%—justine was super extra grateful, even if she never spurted out fancy words, her eyes screamed she was totally in awe of her guardian queen. even though she could be cray asf sometimes, she soaked in every move from my aunt, copying her lingo and drip so hard that even now, she’s a living throwback to that icon.

when my dear aunt got yeeted, everyone was deep in their own grief, missing that poor justine who was ride-or-die at her sickbed with mega anxious vibes. justine was hella sick, but yo, more savage trials were queued up for her, fr fr.

one by one, her bros and sis got yeeted; and her mom, except for her neglected daughter, ended up childfree as hell. her conscience went full drama mode, thinking the deaths of her favs were like divine shade for her major bias. she was straight-up roman catholic, and her confessor was all, "word," confirming her wild theory. so, a few months after u dipped for inglostadt, justine got called home by her repentant, extra mom. poor girl, crying buckets as she bounced out of our house, transformed since auntie’s exit—grief had mellowed her vibe into something soft and almost charming, which was a wild switch from her once super energetic self. and living at mom’s pad didn’t even heal that spark. the poor woman was vacillating on her repentance—sometimes begging for forgiveness, but more often slamming justine for causing the fam wipeouts. nonstop stress had madame moritz in a deep decline, ramping up her irritability at first, but now she’s chill in eternal peace. she dipped when cold weather first rolled in at the start of that last winter. justine just slid back to us; and i swear, i love her tenderly, no cap.

she’s mad smart, gentle, and hella pretty; her whole vibe and look are a constant throwback to my dearly missed aunt, like, full nostalgia mode.

real quick, gotta spill tea about lil darling william, dear cuz. if only u could peep him—this kid is tall for his age, with those sweet, laughing blue eyes that are straight-up vibes, dark lashes, and curls that are on fleek. when he smiles, two adorable dimples pop on each cheek, glowing healthy as heck. he’s already had one or two mini wife moments, but loisa biron is his ultimate fave, this precious five-year-old queen, no cap.

ookay, dear victor, bet u wanna catch some gossip on the geneva squad. like, pretty miss mansfield already got hit with mad congratulatory visits ‘bout her upcoming wedding with a young english dude, john melbourne, esq. then her ugly sis, manon, got hitched to m. duvillard, that rich banker, last autumn. and ur fav school homie, louis manoir, has been riding through a series of brutal misfortunes ever since clerval dipped out of geneva. but yo, he’s bounced back and is lowkey ‘bout to marry a spicy, pretty frenchwoman, madame tavernier. she’s a widow, way older than manoir, but trust, she’s adored and a total fave with everyone, fr.

i done scribbled my vibe into a happier zone, dear cuz; but as i wrap up, anxiety be creeping back in. drop a line, dearest victor—just one fire word, one epic emoji-like note will be a blessing to our crew. mad thanks—like ten thousand—to henry for his clutch kindness, constant affection, and never-ending texts; we’re super grateful, real talk.

adios! my cuz; take care of urself, and for real, hit me up with a write-up!

elizabeth lavenza.

geneva, march 18th, 17—

yo, "dear, dear elizabeth!" i legit screamed after peeping her letter, "imma yeet out a reply ASAP and ease all that heavy anxiety, swear!" i scribbled it out, but damn, that hustle drained me mad hard; still, my recovery kicked off proper, and in like two weeks, i bounced outta my chamber, ready to dip.

one of my first boss moves post-glow up was introducing clerval to a bunch of profs at the uni. doing that, i got totally roasted with rough, extra vibes, not matching the deep scarz on my mind from that fatal night—the end of my labors and start of all my misfortunes—i even got a violent lowkey hate for the whole natural philosophy scene. every time i peeped a chemical gizmo, it kicked off a full meltdown of my nervous feels. henry, being a straight-up gigachad, yeeted out all my deadly apparatus from my sight and even switched up my pad, ‘cause he peeped that i was lowkey hating the old lab zone, fr fr.

but clerval’s care moves totally went 0b1 when i hit up the profs. m. waldman went full torture mode, praising my so-called progress in the sciences with all that warmth and kindness, yet i was not vibing with the subject at all. he peeped my inner cringe but thought it was just humble modesty, so he switched the convo to the subject itself, tryna push me to open up. like, what could i even do? he was tryna please, but instead, he tortured me, laying out one chemical instrument after another like they were doom traps set for a slow, brutal death. i squirmed hard under his words, but couldn’t drop the truth about my pain. clerval, being the ultimate mood reader, bailed on that heavy topic, claiming total ignorance, and our chat slid into more general banter. i sent him dank thanks in my heart, but kept my trap shut; i peeped his shock, yet he never pressed to unearth my secret meltdown story, and even tho i was riding hard on love and mad respect for him, i couldn’t ever spill that dark deets that haunted my brain, fr fr, too risky to let it fully drop.

then m. krempe jumped in, not nearly as chill; in my ultra-sensitive state, his harsh, blunt roasts hit harder than m. waldman’s pseudo-hugs. he bellowed, "d—n the fellow!" then shot off to m. clerval, "guys, i swear, he outstripped every single one of us. aye, check it out if u want, but it's still true. a young buck who, just a few years back, was all in on cornelius agrippa like he was gospel, is now running the uni; and if we don't yeet him down soon, we're all gonna be left in the dust.—aye, aye," he rambled while eyeing my face full of pain, "m. frankenstein is modest; that's an ace trait in a young man. young men gotta be lowkey diffident, u know, m. clerval: i was a noob too, but that vibe fades out mad quick." 

m. krempe then slid into a self-eulogy roast sesh, and thank god, that shifted the convo away from the heavy stuff that was straight up triggering for me.

clerval never got my deep, bitter love for natural science; his lit reading game was on a whole diff channel—oriental languages all day. he rolled up at uni with the goal of mastering oriental tongues and opening up a fire path for his future hustle in the east. i got hyped and jumped into those studies too, ‘cause idleness is basic and my brain needed to yeet out overthinking. having him as a ride-or-die partner was lit—not only did i snag some solid instruction, but his oriental jams gave me mad consolation. i wasn’t tryna get all critical on their dialects, just vibing for some temporary amusement, and their words totally paid off. those melancholy beats were soothing, and their joyful highs hit so different compared to any other country’s authors. reading their scribbles, life turned into a warm sun glow with a rose garden, the mix of enemy smiles and frowns, and that fire burning deep inside—way different from the macho, epic vibes of greece and rome, no cap.

summer ghosted in with these study vibes, and my comeback to geneva was locked for late autumn; but then, a bunch of sus accidents came through, and winter dumped a ton of snow, rendering roads impassable, so my journey got iced until next spring. i was mega salty about that delay ‘cause i was straight-up missing my home turf and my beloved squad. truth be told, my delay was just ‘cause i didn’t wanna leave clerval stranded in a weird place before he met any local peeps, lol. still, winter was kept upbeat, and even though spring dropped in hella late, its epic beauty made up for the slow-mo wait, fr.

may had already dropped, and i was hyped for that daily letter to lock in my departure deets when henry pitched a chill pedestrian tour around inglostadt, so i could drop a personal farewell to the land i’d been crashing forever. i was like, "bet," coz exercise is fire and clerval’s always been my top sidekick for those epic strolls through my home scenes, no cap.

we rolled through a full fortnight of wanderings: my health and mood were fully recharged, boosted by fresh, salubrious air, all the wild natural drama of our trek, and clerval’s non-stop chat. before, study had locked me away from all my peeps, totally unsocial, but clerval brought out the best feels in my heart; he schooled me on loving the vibe of nature and the lit smiles of babes. excellent friend, ur love for me was 100%, always tryna lift my brain vibes up to ur level. my selfish rut had me cramped until ur gentle affection spread warmth and opened my senses, bringing back that happy creature who, years ago, was loved by everyone and had zero cares. when nature’s in a happy, chill state, it drops the sweetest sensations—clear skies and lush fields got me riding pure ecstasy. the season was divine; spring flowers were poppin’ on hedges while summer buds were already in preview mode. i was undisturbed by those heavy-ass thoughts that had weighed me down all last year, even though i tried to shake ‘em, but they stayed like an unyielding burden, smh.

henry was straight vibin’ on my joy, legit sharing in my feels; he went all out to keep me laughing while droppin’ his own deep soul vibes. his brain was on straight fire that day—each convo piece was bursting with wild imagination; sometimes he even dropped some persian and arabic writer inspo, inventing outlandish tales of epic passion and fantasy. other times, he was spitting my fav poems or dragging me into savage debates, flexing mad ingenuity, no cap.

we rolled back to college on a sunday arvo, with peasants dancing like absolute memes and every soul we bumped into lookin’ lit and happy. my mood was sky-high, bouncing around with unbridled joy and pure memetic hilarity, yeet!

chapter 7

when i got back, i peeped this letter from my old man:—

my dear victor,

bet u been waiting like crazy for a letter to lock in the deets of ur comeback; i almost dipped with just a few lame lines, only mentioning the day i expected u, but that would be a straight-up ice-cold kindness, and i ain't 'bout that vibe. can u imagine, my son, expecting a hype welcome only to get hit with tears and straight-up wretchedness? and like, how do i even spill this mega mess? absence ain't turned u into a heartless npc; and how do i add pain for my long-absent son? i tried to prep u for this brutal news, but smh, it's impossible; even now, u’re skimming the page, hunting for the words that drop this horrible tea, fr.

yo, my dear victor, listen—william is dead! that sweet kid whose vibes and smiles used to light up my heart, so gentle and so effing adorable—but yikes, victor, he got straight-up murdered, caught in 4k, no cap!

i ain’t tryna play consoling mode; imma just spill the savage deets.

last thursday (may 7th), me, my niece, and your two bros rolled out for a chill walk in plainpalais. the vibe was warm and serene, so we just kept strolling way past our usual route. it got dark before we remembered to bounce, then we peeped that william and ernest, who had yeeted ahead, were missing af. we parked on a bench waiting for them to slide back. soon enough, ernest came up asking if we’d spotted his bro; he was like, "i was clownin’ with him, but william yeeted off to hide, and i searched like a madman, waited forever, but he just ghosted," big meltdown for real.

this savage account had us shook, so we went full search mode till night slided in, and then elizabeth was like, "maybe he bounced back to the crib?" but nope, he wasn’t there. we rerolled with torches ‘cause i couldn't get my chill on thinking my sweet boy was lost in the damp, dewy night; elizabeth was straight-up in extreme anguish. around five in the morning, i found my precious boy—who just last night was vibing, full on blooming healthy—stretched out on the grass, livid and frozen, with the killer’s fingerprint etched on his neck, raw and brutal.

they hauled him back home, and the anguish on my face spilled the dark tea to elizabeth. she was desperate to peep the corpse. i tried to stop her, but she stormed in, grabbed the victim’s neck, and, hands clapped together, screamed, "o god! i have murdered my darling child!" 

she zonked out, and it took mad effort to reboot her; when she finally came around, it was just endless weeps and sad sighs. she spilled that same evenin’, william had been clownin’ her out, begging to rock a super valuable mini portrait of your mom. that pic? totally ghost, and probs was the bait that triggered the murderer, fr fr. we got zero trace of that killer right now, even though our search game is on endless hustle; but, damn, nothing can bring back my beloved william!

come on, dearest victor; only u can bring chill to elizabeth, who’s crying non-stop and blaming herself for william’s death—her words are straight-up slicing my heart. we’re all in a savage mood; ain’t that extra solid reason for u, my son, to bounce back and be our ultimate comforter? and your dear mama! oh, victor, thank god she didn’t have to witness the cruel, miserable end of her youngest darling, no cap!

come on, victor; ditch those brooding revenge vibes against the assassin, and bring in that peace and gentle energy to heal our battered minds instead of festering hate. roll into the mourning pad, my friend, with nothing but kindness and mad love for those who stan you, and keep that hate for the haters, deadass.

“yo fam, your affectionate and afflicted daddy,
alphonse frankenstein

geneva, may 12th, 17—!!! kffhjsk, deadass

clerval, that lowkey npc who peeped my face while i read that crumpled tea letter, was straight shook to see my mood flip from lit joy to deep despair, caught in 4k, no cap, so i yeeted the letter onto the table and slapped my face with both hands like omg, feelings overload abfabbs, skrrrr.

“my dear frankenstein,” henry snapped, all in his vibe when he peeped me bawling bitter tears, “are you always on this sus sad mode? my dude, what epic fail just went down???” i threw a mad gesture for him to scoop up the letter while i paced up and down the room, buzzing like a jittery meme lord on a caffeine drip, tears streaming like glitchy pixels, as clerval also got hit with tearbombs reading my misfortune saga, deadass.

henry deadass replied, “i got no savage consolations for you, my friend; your disaster is totally glitched and unrepairable, bro. so like, what’s the play?” and i shot back, “imma bounce straight to geneva, so come roll with me, henry, gotta order the horses and flex those rides, skibidi yeet!”

while we were cruisin’ through the streets, clerval tried to spit some heartfelt comfort—full sigma vibes but all over the place—dropping, “poor william! dear lovely kid, now snoozin’ with his angel mom up there! who once shined all bright and joyful, now gotta be mourned like, dang, that innocent glow got yeeted, deadass. only solace? his crew’s crying their eyes out while he’s chillin’ in eternal rest—no more pain, no more pity for him; save that for the left-behind npcs.” his words hit me hard, echoing in my brain later in some lonely, glitchy solo replay. but real quick, as soon as the horses pulled up like “skrrt,” i hopped into a cabriolet and dropped a “peace out, fam” on my friend.

my journey was a whole vibe of deep melancholy, deadass. at first, i was sprinting ‘cause i was hyped to console my grief-stricken crew, but as i neared my home turf, all those feels clogged up my brain so i slowed to a crawl, caught in a wild mix of nostalgia and heartache, OMG so many feels—like 1000 different levels, each one flipping my system. i cruised past all the old-school spots from my youth—places i hadn’t peeped in nearly 6 years—and damn, everything was remixed hardcore. one sudden, brutal change hit me like a bomb, and then tiny glitches piled on steadily, each one slicing through the vibe. i got gripped by fear, too shook to advance, trembling at a thousand nameless evils that i couldn’t even decode… omg fml.

i crashed at lausanne for 2 whole days in that painful, emo state, just starin’ at the chill lake—waters all placid, the whole scene zen AF, while the snowy mountains, nature’s own palaces, stayed unaltered. slowly, that calm, heavenly drip rebooted my soul, and i resumed my trip toward geneva with a bittersweet hustle.

the road hugged the lake, gettin’ tighter as i rolled into my old stomping ground. i peeped the jura’s dark, edgy vibes and the bright peak of mont blanc shining like a giga boss. i bawled like a little noob, crying out, “dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how u greet your wandering soul? your peaks so clear, sky and lake blue and chill—u sayin’ peace is comin’ or just lol-mocking my sad, unhap vibes?” 

yo, frank truth, my friend, i might sound extra boring if i spam these prelude feels, but those were days of half-decent happiness i still stan. my country, my ride-or-die homeland! only a true native could vibe with the joy i felt rewatching your streams, mountains, and especially that bomb lake, fr fr.

yet, as i neared home, grief and fear slammed me again. night dropped hard, the dark mountains barely visible, and my gloom factor soared—like a vast, dim horror scene straight out of a nightmare. i lowkey foresaw myself as the ultimate wretched human, destined for tragic epic fails… alas, i prophesied nearly all my future misery, missing just a fraction of the tex-meltdown i was doomed to endure, omg so extra.

it was pitch black when i slid into geneva’s outskirts; the town gates locked tight, so i had to bunk for the night at secheron, a tiny village half a league out. the sky, oddly serene, didn’t help as i couldn’t sleep; instead, i resolved to check out the spot where my poor william got murked. since i couldn’t even stroll through the town, i had to boat across the lake to plainpalais. on that short, surreal voyage, lightning was flexin’ on mont blanc’s peak in the most epic figures ever—pure art, fr fr. the storm was coming in hot, and once i landed, i scrambled up a low hill to get the 411 on its rampage: clouds rolled in thick and heavy, and then rain started in slow, jumbo drops before cranking into full savage mode, omg.

i yeeted from my seat and marched on even as darkness and storm levels spiked every minute, thunder bashing over my head like a bass drop from a dj set—echoing off salêve, jura, and the alps of savoy. vivid lightning flares turned the lake into a massive sheet of fire for a hot sec, then plunged everything into pitch-black void until my eyes rebooted from the flash, total glitch mode.

typical swiss storm vibes hit off in random sky spots—one savage storm chilling north of town over the stretch between belrive’s promontory and the village of copêt; another storm lightly illuminated jura with faint flash hints; and yet another kept môle, that edgy mountain east of the lake, in shadow then sometimes spilling a peek of its grim shape.

as i watched the tempest—beautiful yet absolutely terrifying—I sped on with mad urgency, heart pounding like a gigachad on a hype beat. i clutched my hands and shouted, “yo william, dear angel, this is your epic funeral, your final dirge, deadass!” no sooner had i dropped that line than, in the gloom, i peeped a shady figure sneaking out from behind a clump of trees near me. i froze, eyes glued, knowing it couldn’t be a glitch—then a lightning flash lit up that monstrous shape: gigantic stature, hideously deformed, a filthy dæmon born from my own twisted genius. instantly, my brain screamed: that’s the wretch, the demon i birthed, and i nearly lost it when i thought—could he be (ugh, nightmare mode) the murderer of my own bro?! as soon as that thought loaded, i got shook hard, teeth chattering, forced to lean on a tree like a trembling noob. the figure sped past me in a blink, vanishing into the dark void—there’s no way a human form could off our pure lil william. he WAS the murderer, no doubt, the idea itself was an unbeatable proof. i tried to chase that devilish meme, but it was futile—another lightning flash caught him chilling among the rocks on mont salêve’s nearly vertical ascent, the hill that borders plainpalais to the south. he hit the summit and then just yeeted outta sight, gone.

i stood locked in place, motionless. eventually, the thunder dipped out but the rain kept pouring and the whole scene was swallowed by an impenetrable darkness. i replayed the whole tragic saga in my brain—the wild ride toward my own creation, the moment i witnessed my handiwork come alive at my bedside, then its departure; it’d been almost 2 years since that fateful night of first life, and now, was this its debut crime? alas, i realized with a heavy heart that i’d unleashed a depraved misfit who thrived on carnage and misery—had he not murked my own bro already, fr fr.

nobody can even fathom the mega anguish i suffered through the rest of that night, spent cold and drenched in the open air. but the weather didn’t even phase me ‘cause my mind was too busy streaming scenes of pure evil and despair. i pondered this being i’d cast into mankind, endowed with the will and twisted power to commit horror—just like that horrific deed, almost like my own spilled-out vampire spirit from the grave, forced to destroy everything dear to me, omg.

day broke, and i hustled my steps toward town; the gates were open, so i bolted to my father’s crib. my first brainwave was to sniff out the murderer and kick off an immediate manhunt, but then i paused—realizing the story i had to spill was too wild: i, the creator, had birthed a being and set it free at midnight on the edge of some off-the-grid mountain, all while i was battling a fevered, delirious high during my creation, making the tale sound like pure insane meme madness. i knew if anyone else dropped that bomb, they’d be chalked up as a madman; plus, this twisted creature would slip through any pursuit—even convincing the fam to chase it would be like trying to box the wind or catch a mountain stream with a straw. so i straight-up decided to keep it on the low.

around 5am, i rolled into dad’s house, telling the servants “don’t disturb the fam” and diving into the library for that classic pre-rise ritual.

6 years had flown by, like a hazy dream with one indelible trace, and i found myself back where i last hugged dad before jetting off to ingolstadt—beloved and venerable parent vibes still in my heart, fr fr. i stared at the pic of my mom hanging over the mantel—a historic masterpiece painted on dad’s orders, showing caroline beaufort in deep despair, kneeling by her dead dad’s coffin; her rustic garb and pale cheeks exuded a bittersweet dignity and beauty, so intense no pity could even compete. below that was a tiny portrait of william, and my tears just flowed nonstop. meanwhile, ernest bounced in, having heard my arrival, and rushed to greet me with, “welcome, my dearest victor,” dropping that vintage fam love, “ah! i wish u’d come three months ago so we could’ve been all joyous and vibin’, but now u roll in to share a misery that nothing can fix; yet, i hope your presence can re-up dad’s faltering vibe and talk elizabeth out of her endless self-blame—poor william, our darling pride!” 

bro’s tears cascaded uncontrollably, and a crushing mortal agony wrapped me tight. i’d only ever imagined the desolation of my home before, but now reality smacked me with a new, even harsher catastrophe. i tried to soothe ernest, asked for more deets about dad, and even named my cousin in the mix.

“she most of all,” ernest said, “needs the biggest consolation; she’s been blaming herself for my bro’s death and is wrecked because of it. but now that the murderer’s been snatched in the act—”

“the murderer discovered?! good god, how is that even possible? like, who’s gonna try chasing him down? it’s impossible—like trying to outrun the wind or trap a mountain stream with a straw. i peeped him too; he was free last night!” i blurted, totally shook.

“i dunno what u mean,” ernest replied in a tone of wonder, “but for us, this discovery just completed our misery. no one would’ve believed it at first; and even now elizabeth ain’t buying it, despite all the evidence. seriously, who’d believe that justine moritz—so sweet and tight with the fam—could suddenly flip into committing such a horrific, appalling crime?”

“justine moritz! poor, poor girl—so, is she the accused? but like, it’s totally wrongful; everyone knows it’s cap; no one believes it, right ernest?”

“at first, nobody did; but a whole bunch of sus circumstances came out, practically forcing a conviction on us, and her own messy behavior only piled on the weight of the facts—i fear it leaves zero hope for doubt. but she’s being tried today, and you’ll catch all the deets then.”

ernest then dropped that on us: the morning they discovered poor william was murked, justine got hit with a nasty illness and was benched in bed for days. meanwhile, one of the servants, lowkey checking out her murder-night outfit, found a pic of my mom in her pocket—which everyone judged to be the murderer’s temptation bait. that servant instantly passed it to another, who, without spilling a word to the fam, ran to a magistrate; following their deposition, justine got cuffed. when charged, the poor girl only added fuel to the fire with her extreme confusion, totally confirming the suspicions.

this wild tale was crazy enough, but it didn’t shake my core faith; i straight-up replied, “y’all are dead wrong; i know who the murderer is. justine, poor sweet justine, is 100% innocent.”

right then, my dad stormed in—his face a deep map of unhappiness, yet still trying to welcome me with fake cheer—and after our mournful greet exchange, he almost switched the convo away from our disaster, if not for ernest yelling, “good god, papa! victor says he knows who offed poor william!”

“we do too, unfortunately,” dad sighed, “cuz honestly, i’d rather’ve stayed clueless forever than discover so much depravity and ungratefulness in someone i held so high.” 

“my dear father, you got it twisted; justine is innocent,” i shot back.

“if she is, god forbid she suffers guilt, because she’s on trial today—and i seriously hope she gets acquitted,” dad finished.

that talk chilled me big time. i was rock-solid convinced that justine—and honestly, every human being—was not to blame for this kill. i had zero fear that any shady circumstantial evidence could stick and convict her. my story wasn’t meant for loud public shouts; its staggering horror would just be brushed off as mad ramblings by the average npc. like, who else but me, the creator, would even believe in this wild living monument of presumptive, rash ignorance i unleashed on the world, unless their own senses caught the truth, deadass.

we were soon joined by elizabeth—time had flipped her vibe since i last peeped her, leveling her up with a loveliness that totally outshined her childlike days. she kept that original candor and vivacity but mixed in a heavy dose of sensibility and brainpower. she hyped me up with mad affection, saying, “your arrival, my dear cousin, fills me with hope. maybe you’ll find a hack to clear my poor, guilt-free justine. alas, who’s ever safe if she gets convicted? i trust her innocence like i trust my own vibe. our misfortune slaps us double—we not only lost that darling boy, but this poor girl, whom i truly love, is at risk of an even worse fate. if she’s condemned, i’ll never know joy again. but i know she won’t be guilty; then i’ll be happy once more, even after the sad loss of my little william.”

“she’s innocent, my elizabeth,” i reassured, “and that’s gonna be proven; so fear not, let your heart be lifted by the certainty of her acquittal, on god.”

“how kind and generous you are! everyone else is riding the guilt train, and it crushed me ‘cause i knew it was impossible—seeing everyone else so prejudiced was a brutal blow, leaving me hopeless and drowning in despair,” she sobbed, tears streaming.

“dearest niece,” dad crooned, “wipe those tears. if she’s as innocent as you believe, trust in our laws' justice and know i’m out here, grinding hard to block even the tiniest shadow of bias.”

chapter 8

we slogged through a few sad AF hours til 11 o’clock when the trial was set to kick off. my dad and the rest of the fam had to roll as witnesses, so i trailed them to court, where the whole scene felt like a savage mockery of justice—i was enduring straight-up living torture. they were gonna decide if my wild curiosity and lawless experiments had cost two lives: one, a smiling babe oozing pure innocence and joy, and the other, a tragically murked soul with every dark twist imaginable, making that murder an epic horror moment. justine, who once shone with promise and had a vibe that promised a happy life, was now about to be dropped into an ignominious grave—and i was the cause! a thousand times, i wish i could’ve taken the blame for justine’s alleged crime, but i was MIA when it went down, and that confession would’ve just sounded like a madman’s rant, not exonerating the poor girl who was suffering through my chaos.

justine showed up with a strangely calm aura—dressed in mourning, her normally engaging face now a canvas of solemn beauty. still, she held herself with a confidence in her innocence, not trembling even as thousands glared and cursed her name, their once adoring feelings for her beauty completely wiped out by the horror they imagined she’d committed. she looked tranquil, though her calm was forced—since her earlier confusion was twisted into proof of her guilt, she hustled to project some courage. when she stepped into court, she scanned the room like a pro, spotting our seat almost in a blink. a tear almost shimmered in her eye when she saw us, but she quickly snapped back, giving off a vibe of profound sorrow that screamed her absolute, unshakeable innocence.

the trial kicked off and after the advocate against her laid down the charge, a slew of witnesses was called up. a bunch of bizarre, sus facts stacked against her—enough to stagger anyone who didn’t have my hardcore proof of her innocence. word was, she’d been out the entire night of the murder, and by morning, a market-woman near where the murdered child’s body was later found spotted her. when asked what she was even doing there, she just gave a confused, unintelligible reply. she came home around 8 o’clock, and when prodded about where she spent the night, she said she was out searching for the child, even demanding if anyone had heard any tea about him. then, when shown the body, she lost it—falling into violent hysterics and staying in bed for days. the servant then produced a picture he’d found in her pocket; and when elizabeth, voice faltering hard, confirmed it was the very same pic that had been placed around the child’s neck an hour before he went missing, the court was hit with a murmur of horror and outrage, like, epic drama central.

justine was then called up to defend herself. as the trial pushed on, her face transformed with shock, horror, and deep misery—sometimes battling back tears, but when it came time to plead, she mustered up every bit of courage and spoke out in a shaky but audible voice.

“god knows,” she declared, “how totally and utterly i am innocent. i’m not saying my words will magically clear me; i’m laying down my innocence on a plain, simple breakdown of the facts thrown at me, and i hope the character i’ve always rocked sways my judges to see things in my favor when anything looks even a little bit sus.”



she then spilled that, yo, thanks to elizabeth’s greenlit vibes, she spent the whole night chillin’ at her aunt’s crib in chêne, that tiny village like a league out from geneva deadass, and on her comeback—around nine o’clock, fr—she bumped into some random dude askin’ if she peeped any trace of that lost kid, caught in 4k vibes, ya feel? so she legit flipped out and spent mad hours searchin’ for him, but then geneva’s gates got clapped shut and she was forced to crash for hours in a sketchy barn near a cottage, too extra to call up the locals she was known to, no cap; most of the night she was on full watch mode, and when morning hit she was like, “bet, i only clocked a few z’s”—then some random steps shook her, and bam, she woke up, dawning like a glitchy sunrise, and she yeeted outta her asylum tryna peep my bro again, deadass; if she dipped near where his body was laid out, that was totally off her radar, fr; and when the market-woman grilled her, she got all confused and shook, which was mad expected after a brutal, sleepless night and with poor william’s fate still in limbo, no cap—plus about that pic? she had nada to drop, straight mute on that tea.

“yo i know,” continued the unhappy victim, spilling, “this one crazy circumstance is hella heavy and hits me fatal, but i got zero power to break it down; once i dropped my whole ignorant spiel, i was left guessin’ how it got yeeted into my pocket, deadass, but here my vibe got totally checked—i swear i got no enemy on this planet, and seriously, no one would go full evil just to snatch my shine. did the murderer just yeet it in there? i ain’t seen him get an op chance to do that; and if i did—why snatch the bling only to toss it back so fast, big yikes?”

i throw my whole saga to the justice squad, yet, on god, there’s zero hope drip. i beg for a few witnesses to flex on my character, and if their clap-back doesn’t outweigh my supposed guilt, then imma be condemned—though i’d bet my whole salvation on my innocence, deadass.

several old-school homies got called up who’d known her for mad years and were all “facts” about her; but lowkey, fear and straight-up hate over the sketchy crime they pegged her for made them all beta and too scared to step forward, smh. elizabeth peeped even that last resort—her top-tier vibes and squeaky-clean conduct—on the verge of failing the accused, and though she was lit up with mad agitation, she begged for the mic in court, no cap.

“i am,” she dropped, “the cousin of that sad kid who got murdered, or like, more so his sis, cuz i was raised by and vibed with his folks foreva, even way before his drip hit the scene. so yeah, it might seem extra for me to slide up on this occasion, but when i peep a fellow creature about to get yeeted by the cowardly actions of her fake squad, i gotta speak up and spill what i know about her real character, deadass. i tagged along in the same crib with her—five years here and nearly two back then—and throughout that whole ride, she was the most amiable and benevolent human ever, no cap. she took care of madame frankenstein, my aunt, in her final sick drop with all the love and care, and then even looked after her own mama during a draggy, endless illness, earning mad props from everyone who knew her; later, she bounced back to my uncle’s pad, where the fam straight-up adored her. she was hella tight with the kid who’s now ghosted, treating him like a super affectionate mom, real on god. i ain’t even scared to admit that, despite all the trash evidence thrown at her, i trust and ride for her pure, untarnished vibes—she’d never have gone off like that; and if she’d been lowkey cravin’ that bauble, i would’ve yeeted it to her in a heartbeat, so much do i stan her.”

immediately, a lowkey hype murmur dropped for elizabeth’s simple yet savage appeal—but yo, it was more about her generous interference than any backup for poor justine, who got straight-up roasted with renewed public shade for being extra ungrateful, blackest ingratitude style. she bawled mad tears while elizabeth spilled all that truth, but straight-up stayed silent. meanwhile, my own meltdown and deep agony hit over the whole trial; i believed in her innocence hard, like, i knew it in my bones. but then, could that damn daemon who, i never doubted for a sec, yeeted my bro in his hellish antics, also have betrayed the innocent to a fate of death and ignominy? i couldn’t even hold the horror of my messed-up sitch, and when i peeped that the popular voice and the judge squad’s expressions had already condemned my unlucky victim, i straight-up yeeted outta the court in savage agony, fam. the accused’s torture wasn’t nearly as extra as my own pain; she was riding on pure innocence vibes, but the fangs of regret tore into my chest like a glitching meme that wouldn’t quit.

i spent a night drowning in unmingled wretchedness. come sunrise, i slid back to the court, lips and throat parched like dry memes—i was so shook i dared not even drop the fatal question, yet i was known on the block and the officer instantly copped why i was there. ballots got tossed; they came in all black, and justine ended up condemned, no cap.

i can’t even vibe describe what hit me next. i’d been through horror feels before and tried to drop words that matched, but nothing—even the dankest of expressions—can capture that heart-crushing despair i was deep in. the one i chatted with added that justine had already dropped her own confession of guilt. “that evidence,” he observed, “was hella extra in such a blatant case, but i’m honestly glad about it, and really, none of our judge squad likes to condemn a crook based on lowkey circumstantial tea—even if it’s super decisive.”

this tea was mad strange and hella unexpected, like what the actual heck? did my eyes play me for a fool? and am i really as cray as the whole world would call me if i spilled my sus secrets? i yeeted right home, and elizabeth was all over the deets. “my cousin,” i clapped back, “it’s all set, just as u expected; all the judge homies would rather see ten innocent souls suffer than let one guilty head bounce free. but yo, she already confessed.”

that hit poor elizabeth hard, who had banked on justine’s pure vibes. “alas!” she wailed, “how tf am i ever gonna trust in human goodness again? justine, who i loved and held up as my sis, how could she flash those innocent smiles only to betray us? her gentle eyes were like, incapable of any savage twist, yet she went and dropped a murder move.”

not long after, we peeped that the poor victim even wanted to see my cousin. my old man wasn’t feelin’ it and tried to stop her, but ultimately said it was on her own squad to decide. “yes,” elizabeth clapped, “i’mma roll even if she’s guilty; and yo, victor, you gotta squad up with me—i can’t dip solo.” the idea of that visit was straight-up torture for me, yet i couldn’t ghost it.

we bounced into this gloomy prison chamber and spotted justine chillin’ on some straw at the far end; her hands were clamped in chains and her head was laid low on her knees. she peeped us comin’, and when we were left alone, she yeeted herself at elizabeth’s feet, bawlin’ bitterly. my cuz was shedding tears too. “oh, justine!” she dropped, “why did you straight rob me of my last consolation? i was all in on your innocence—even when i was wrecked, i wasn’t this extra miserable!” 

“and u think i’m hella wicked?” justine sobbed, “u join up with my haters to crush me and tag me as a murderer?” her voice was choked with salty sobs.

“rise up, my poor girl,” elizabeth commanded, “why be kneelin’ if u’re truly innocent? i ain’t one of ur haters—I was down with your innocence, despite all the evidence, until i heard you dropped your own guilt bomb. that report, u say, is bogus; and believe, dear justine, nothing shakes my confidence in u—not even your confession.”

“i did confess, but it was all cap—a straight lie i dropped just to snag absolution; but now that fake drip weighs heavier on my heart than all my other sins combined, deadass. the god of heaven, forgive me! ever since i got condemned, my confessor’s been all over me, threatening and menacing until i almost started to believe i was the monster he kept hyping. he even dropped excommunication and hellfire threats for my final moments if i stayed stubborn, yo. dear lady, i had zero support; everyone peeped me as a doomed wretch destined for ignominy and perdition. what could i even do? in a cursed moment, i subscribed to a lie—and now, i’m the one truly miserable.”

she paused, bustin’ out tears, then kept on, “i straight-up thought, my sweet lady, that u’d back your justine—the one your blessed auntie hyped up so high and who you loved like your own—was a creature capable of a crime that only the devil squad could even dream of droppin’, deadass. oh dear william! dearest blessed kid, i swear i’ll link up with you in heaven soon, where we all get mad happy; and that, believe it, consoles me as i head into ignominy and death.”

“oh, justine! forgive me for doubting you for even a hot sec—why did you drop that confession? but don’t cry, babe, don’t fear. i’mma go off and broadcast, prove your innocence, melt the stone-cold hearts of all your haters with my tears and prayers. you ain’t gonna die! you, my playfellow, my ride or die, my sis, can’t just perish on that scaffold! no! no! i never thought i’d see someone take on such a brutal misfortune.”

justine shook her head all gloomy and said, “i ain’t even trippin’ about dyin’—that pain is in the rearview now. god upgrades my weakness and dishes out courage to handle the worst, ya feel? i’m bouncin’ from this bitter world; and if u remember me as some unjustly condemned vibe, i’m resigned to whatever fate drops my way. learn from me, dear lady—submit to the will of heaven with patience!”

meanwhile, during all this chatter, i yeeted myself to a dark corner of the cell, tryna hide the raw agony that was straight-up consuming me. despair? who even dared drop that word? the poor victim, facing the brutal threshold between life and death the next day, didn’t feel the deep, bitter mess like i did; i ground my teeth and let out a groan from the depths of my soul. justine jumped when she peeped me, rolled over, and said, “dear sir, you’re mad kind for visitin’—hope you don’t think i’m guilty, deadass?”

i froze, couldn’t even speak, and then elizabeth chimed in, “no, justine—he’s even more convinced of your innocence than i ever was, ‘cause even when he heard you confess, he didn’t buy that cap.”

“i truly thank him,” justine whispered, “in these final ticks, i’m feelin’ the most sincere gratitude for anyone who vibes kindness my way. like, the affection from others takes away more than half my misfortune—i feel like i could even dip peacefully now that my pure vibes are recognized by you, dear lady, and your cuz.”

so the poor sufferer tried to drop some comfort for herself and the crew, and she even snagged the resignation she craved. but me, the true murderer, felt this never-ending worm of despair chuggin’ in my chest, letting no hope or dope consolation come through, deadass. elizabeth cried her heart out too, suffering from that misery that only pure innocence can bring—like a dark cloud that passes over a lit moon, hiding the glow for a minute but never doin’ permanent damage. anguish and despair penetrated the very core of my being; i carried a personal hell that no fire could snuff. we stayed with justine for hours, and elizabeth struggled so hard to peel herself away. “i wish,” she cried, “i could even die right here with you; i just can’t vibe in this brutal world of misery.”

justine then tried to muster a fake air of cheer even while barely holdin’ back bitter tears. she hugged elizabeth and whispered, “farewell, sweet lady, dearest elizabeth, my beloved and one-and-only bestie; may heaven, in all its bae-level bounty, bless and keep you—may this be the last misfortune u ever face! live, be happy, and spread the good vibes to others, deadass!”

and on the morrow, justine yeeted out of life. elizabeth’s heart-wrenching, raw appeal couldn’t sway the judge squad from their locked-in verdict on the criminality of this saintly sufferer. my passionate, indignant pleas got straight-up ghosted by them, and when i caught their frosty answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling logic of those dudes, my intended declaration died on my lips. so, i might get labelled a madman, but i refuse to take back that sentence passed on my wretched victim—she perished on the scaffold, tagged a full-on murderer!

from the tortures of my own shattered heart, i peeped the deep, voiceless grief of my elizabeth—and yo, that was on me too! and my dad’s broken vibes, plus the desolation of that once-smiley home, were all on account of my thrice-accursed, janky hands! yeep, cry on, unhappy squad, but these ain’t your final tears—u’ll raise that funeral wail again and again, and your endless laments will loop on repeat! frankenstein, your son, your blood, your early and much-loved homie—the dude who’d spill every last drop of life for y’all, who finds no joy except mirrored in your dear faces, who’d bless the whole world and spend his life servin’ you—he commands u to weep and drop endless tears; happy beyond all hopes, if fate’s wild plan gets satisfied, and if destruction takes a timeout before the grave’s peace wraps around your sad torments!

thus spoke my prophetic soul, torn apart by remorse, horror, and despair, as i watched those i loved drop vain sorrow over the graves of william and justine, the OG hapless victims of my unholy, clout-chasin’ arts.

chapter 9

nothing hurts the human mind like when, after a mad rapid-fire of intense feels, you hit that dead calm of inaction where both hope and fear ghost you, no cap. justine dipped, she found her rest, and i was still kickin’, yet my blood kept flowin’ like an endless river while a heavy load of despair and remorse smashed into my heart that nothing could yeet away. sleep bailed on me; i wandered like a sketchy evil spirit, ‘cuz i had pulled off mischief so horrific it’s unthinkable—and i convinced myself that way more chaos was still lurkin’ behind, deadass. yet somehow my heart still overflowed with kindness and those vintage virtue vibes; i began life with nothing but benevolent intents and was straight-up thirsty for the moment i could flex them and be useful to my squad, ya dig? now, everything was blasted; instead of that serene conscience glow that let me look back and feel all self-satisfied while dreamin’ up new hopes, remorse and guilt snatched me away into a hellish torture so intense no language could even glitch out its desc—real talk.

this crumbled headspace wrecked my health, which probably never bounced back from that first brutal shock, fr. i shunned any human face; every sound of joy or chill vibes became torture, no cap; solitude—deep, dark, deathlike alone mode—was my only true plug for comfort.

my dad peeped the massive shift in my vibe and habits, and using his zen, guilt-free wisdom, he tried to drop some truth bombs to ignite my fortitude and spark the courage to blast away that dark cloud hangin’ over me. “do you think, victor,” he asked, “that i ain’t suffering too? no one could love a kid more than how i loved your brother”—tears streamed as he dropped that, “but isn’t it our duty to not up the survivors’ unhappiness by showin’ too much grief? and it’s on you too, ‘cause too much sorrow stops any glow-up or daily grind—and without that, no one’s fit for society, deadass.”

this advice, though legit, was straight-up useless for my case; i should’ve been the first to ghost my grief and hype up my crew, but remorse mixed its bitter tea with terror and every other raw feel, so i could only shoot my dad a look full of despair and dip from his sight.

around then, we bounced back to our crib at belrive—which was a major glow-up for me, fr. the nightly gate claps at ten and the no-go stay-on-the-lake rule made geneva’s residence mad irksome, so i was finally free, deadass! after the fam dipped for the night, i’d hop on a boat and drift for hours on the water. sometimes, with my sails up, i got carried by the wind; other times, i rowed into mid-lake, yeeted the boat to ride its own wave, and let my miserable thoughts spill out. in those rare moments when everything was mad peaceful and i was the only restless glitch in a perfect, heavenly scene (except for some bat or frogs croakin’ interrupted beats just when i got close to shore), i was tempted to dive headfirst into the silent lake, so deep that its waters could cover all my calamities forever, yo. but nah, i held it down ‘cuz i peeped heroic elizabeth, my ride or die who i loved tenderly, and whose entire existence was wrapped up in mine. plus, i thought of my dad and surviving bro—would i, through this base move of ditchin’ life, leave them exposed to the fiend’s malice that i unleashed? straight-up, no.

in those moments, i bawled bitterly and wished so hard that peace would crash back into my mind just to serve up some consolation and happiness for them—but that hope got yeeted away by remorse. i was the OG author of irreversible evils, livin’ every day in terror that the monster i birthed would drop some new wicked move. i had this lowkey feeling that it wasn’t over yet, that he’d still cop a signal crime so massive it’d almost erase the past from memory, deadass. fear always lurked as long as anything i loved was still around. my hate for that fiend was beyond words—every time i thought of him, i ground my teeth, my eyes flared like crazy, and i wished with all my might to snuff out that life i so thoughtlessly unleashed. thinkin’ of his crimes and malice made my hatred and thirst for revenge blow up beyond any limit—i’d have trekked to the highest peak of the andes if it meant droppin’ him to the bottom, no cap. i wanted to face him again so i could unload the full force of my abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine, fr.

our crib became a total mourning zone. my dad’s health was shattered by the pure horror of recent events. elizabeth was mad low and despondent; she lost all that joy in her everyday grind—every bit of pleasure started feelin’ like sacrilege to the dead, and she reckoned that eternal woe and endless tears were the only decent tribute to that blasted, destroyed innocence. she wasn’t that happy soul who, back in the day, used to wander with me along the lake banks, chattin’ about our lit future prospects, deadass. the first wave of sorrow, sent to wean us from this world, hit her hard and dimmed her dearest smiles, no cap.

when i reflect, my dear cuz, on that ultra tragic demise of justine moritz, i legit don’t see the world and its lame works like they used to be, deadass!!! back then i was peepin’ all those shady tales of vice and injustice in dusty books or hearing gossip from random peeps, thinkin’ they were just old-school myths or bogus evils—at least they were remote AF and more lowkey chill for the brain than for wild imagination, but now, yo, misery slid in like a glitch and dudes are lookin’ like bloodthirsty monsters tryna yeet each other’s clout, no cap!!!  
   
yeah, i might be totally off, but every npc was like, “that poor girl’s guilty,” and even if she did drop the crime, she'd be the most depraved human, fr fr. like, for a few sparkly jewels, to off the son of her benefactor and bestie—a kid she nurtured from day one and loved as if it were her own—bro, i could never vibe with the death of any human, but for real, i’d have thought such a messed-up creature unfit to roll with the man squad, deadass!!! but yo, she was innocent, i know it, i feel it, and if you’re riding the same wave, that legit confirms me. oh man, victor, when fake news looks as real as the truth, who can even flex real happiness? i feel like i'm tiptoeing on the edge of a cliff with thousands ready to yeet me straight into that abyss of doomscroll, omg. william and justine got straight-up assassinated, and the murderer ghosted—he’s out here roamin’ free, maybe even flexin’ on the gram. even if i got sentenced on the scaffold for the same sus crimes, i wouldn’t swap places with that tragic loser, skibidi bop!!!  
   
i was readin’ that wild discourse with mega agony vibes, not that i did it IRL but lowkey, in effect, i was the true killer, no cap!!! elizabeth peeped my whole anguish vibe from my face, grabbed my hand like, “my dearest bestie, chill your jets. these events got me wrecked deep down, god knows how heavy, but i ain’t as jaded as you, so breathe and touch grass. there’s a sick mix of despair and lowkey revenge in your mug that’s makin’ me tremble, bro. dear victor, ditch those dark feels. remember your ride-or-die squad who banks all their hype on you—did we lose our power to spark your happiness? ah! while we love and keep it 100 with each other in this land of peace and beauty, your own native zone, we can scoop every chill blessing—ain’t nothin’ gonna shake our vibe, for realsies.”  
   
and yo, didn’t those sweet words from her—who i once prized more than any fortune drop—vibe enough to yeet away that fiendish glitch lurking in my heart? even as she was droppin’ wisdom, i sneaked up close like a jittery ghost, terrified that at that very sec the destroyer might pop up to snatch her away, caught in 4k style!!!  
   
so like, not even the squad’s tender friendship vibes, nor the bomb beauty of this earth or even high-key heaven, could hack my soul from drowning in woe; the whole love frequency was straight up ineffective, ksjdfh!!! i was wrapped in a dark cloud that no epic vibe could penetrate—like a wounded deer draggin’ its faint limbs to some unknown brake, starin’ at the arrow that skewered it, then falling off into oblivion, a total mirror of me, no cap!!!  
   
sometimes i could ride out the sullen despair that slammed into me, but other times the whirlwind feels of my soul had me bouncin’ around, tryna smash out some relief through a savage workout or a remix of location changes, just to escape these intolerable vibes. on one of those chaotic escapades, i peaced out from home, bending my steps toward the nearby alpine valleys, seeking in the epic eternity of those scenes to forget my transient, human sorrows, deadass. my wander sesh headed straight to the valley of chamounix, a vibe i rode hard on in my boyhood—six years deep now and i was a wreck, yet those savage eternal scenes stayed lit like the same savage meme, omg asdfgh!!!  
   
i kicked off the journey on horseback, then hopped on a mule (which was way more surefooted and least sus on these rugged roads). the weather was dope; it was like mid-august, almost two months after justine’s tragic exit—the miserable era i now tag as my ongoing woe timeline. the weight on my spirit got hella lighter as i dove deep into the arve ravine, surrounded by massive mountains and edges that loomed like giant cliff emojis, the river raging among the rocks, and waterfalls droppin’ down like nature’s own bass drops, all flexin’ a power mightier than anything—omnipotence on full display, and i straight up ceased fearin’ any being less almighty than that cosmic creator vibe. still, as i clambered higher, the valley morphed into an even more mind-blowing, astonishing spectacle: ruined castles hangin’ on cliff edges like glitchy overlays, the impetuous arve, and random cottages peeking out from trees in a scene of singular epic beauty—upgraded further by the mighty alps, with white, shining pyramids and domes towering above like they belonged to another realm, another squad of beings, no cap!!!  
   
i rolled past the bridge of pélissier, where the ravine—sculpted by the river—opened up before me, and i began climpin’ the mountain that loomed over it. soon after, i dipped into the valley of chamounix, which was even more wild and sublime—though not as picturesque as that of servox i just bounced out of, but still a whole mood. high snowy mountains boxed it in like epic boundaries, and i peeped no more ruined castles or fertile fields vibes. massive glaciers cruised by the road; i caught the rumbling thunder of an avalanche dropping and even marked the smoke trail it left behind. mont blanc, the quintessential and majestic mont blanc, flexed itself from the surrounding aiguilles, its monstrous dome watchin’ over the valley like a gigachad boss.  
   
a weird, long-lost tingle of pleasure would sometimes hit me on this wild trek—like a flash of nostalgia from days when every twist in the road or random sight triggered memories of carefree boyhood ragers, full of lighthearted joy. the very winds whispered soothing, lowkey lullabies, and mother nature herself was like, “cry no more, fam.” then, as if the vibes flipped, that tender influence bailed and i was once again shackled to grief, drowning in overthinking and toxic feels. so i spurred on my ride, hustlin’ hard to forget this messed-up world, my deep fears, and like, my own messed-up self—or sometimes, in a total meltdown moment, i’d yeet off and crash onto the grass, weighed down by horror and despair, legit overwhelmed!!!  
   
at long last, i rolled into the village of chamounix. exhaustion smacked me after that insane combo of body and mind fatigue i’d been riding through. for a hot minute, i chilled at a window, starin’ at pale lightning dancin’ above mont blanc and listenin’ to the arve roar beneath, all the while those same chill sounds acted like a lullaby for my hypersensitive feels; when i finally dropped my head on my pillow, sleep snuck in smooth, blessing me with that sweet oblivion, no cap!!!  
   
chapter 10  
   
so like, i spent the next day roammin’ through the valley on a full wander mode. i hung out by the source of the arveiron, which kicks off from a glacier that creeps down from the summit like a slow-mo boss to barricade the valley, ksjdhf!!! massive mountains with abrupt, savage sides laid out before me; an icy wall of glacier overhead, a few busted pines scattered here and there; and the solemn silence of this imperial nature chamber was only broken by the brawlin’ crash of waves or the echo of some huge ice fragment droppin’, the thunderous clap of an avalanche, or the crunchin’ of ancient ice shattered by nature’s unchangeable rules—like a plaything in the hands of fate, constantly rippin’ and tearin’ apart. these next-level, dope scenes gave me the sickest consolation i could muster; they hoisted me above all those petty feels, and even though they didn’t erase my grief, they toned it down and chilled it out hard. lowkey, they even distracted my brain from those dark, broody thoughts that had been spinnin’ all month. at night, i crashed, with my sleep served up by the grand assembly of visions i’d soaked in during the day—snowy mountain tops, glitterin’ pinnacles, pine forests, ragged ravines, and eagles flexin’ in the clouds—all circlin’ around like a posse tellin’ me to just be at peace.  
   
but then, when i woke up the next morning, where the heck had all that epic squad vanished to? all that soul-inspirin’ energy was ghosted with my sleep, and a dark, heavy melancholy clung to every thought. rain was pourin’ like insane torrents, and thick mists hid the mountain peaks so tight that i couldn’t even peep the faces of those mighty homies. still, i was determined to bust through that misty barrier and track 'em down in their cloudy retreats—what are rain and storms, anyway? my mule was chillin’ by the door, and i set my mind to ascend the summit of montanvert. i remembered that insane effect when i first scoped the colossal, ever-movin’ glacier—it hit me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to my soul and let it soar from that murky world straight to light and joy, sigma male grindset vibes for real. the sight of nature’s brutal, majestic power always leveled me up, makin’ me forget life’s petty dramas. i decided to roll solo—no guide needed, cuz i knew the path by heart and extra company would kill the solitary, epic grandeur of the scene, deadass.  
   
the ascent was steep and hella precipice-like, but the path was cut into constant, twisty short windings that let you beast through the vertical madness. it was a scene of epic desolation. in like a thousand spots, you could peep the scars of winter avalanches—trees smashed and strewn around, some totally wrecked, others bent, leaning on jutting rocks or crashing against each other. as you climbed higher, the trail got intersected by snowy ravines where stones rolled downhill nonstop; one spot was extra sus, where even the tiniest noise—like the sound of someone speakin’ loud—could trigger a shockwave of air strong enough to wreck the speaker, omg. the pines weren’t tall or lush, but they had that grim, somber nature that just added to the overall hardcore vibe. i looked down on the valley; massive mists were risin’ from the runnin’ rivers, swirlin’ thickly around the opposite mountains whose peaks were totally hidden in the same monotone cloud, while rain poured down from a dark, moody sky, extra intensifying the melancholy aura. alas, why does man boast about havin’ feels that are supposedly superior to those of mere brutes? it only makes us extra necessary and hyper-sensitive, no cap. if our urges were limited to hunger, thirst, and raw desire, we might be nearly chill; but now, every random gust or rogue word hits us like a meme gone viral.  
   
we chill; a dream can totally ruin your sleep vibe.  
   
we wake; one wandering thought can mess up the day, fr fr.  
   
we feel, think, or even drop a diss; laugh or cry,  
   
embrace that bittersweet sadness, or yeet your cares away;  
   
it’s the same deal: whether you’re vibin’ with joy or wallowing in sorrow,  
   
the exit path is always wide open, no cap.  
   
man’s yesterday might never hit like his tomorrow;  
   
nothing lasts except that constant flex of change!  
   
it was nearly noon when i finally reached the top of the climb, deadass. i parked my vibe on a rock overlookin’ a wild sea of ice. a thick mist ghosted both the ice and the surrounding mountains until a breezy yeet cleared it off, and i descended onto the glacier. the surface was mad uneven, risin' like wild waves in a troubled sea, droppin’ low and cut up by deep rifts that threatened to suck you in. the ice field stretched almost a league wide, and i spent nearly two hours crossin’ that frozen chaos. the mountain straight across was just a bare, vertical rock; from my stance, montanvert sat exactly opposite at about a league’s distance, and above it, mont blanc reared up in epic, awful majesty. i chilled in a cozy recess of the rock, starin’ at this mind-blowingly stupendous scene—the vast river of ice snaking among mountains whose airy summits hung over deep recesses, their glitterin’ peaks shinin’ in the sunlight above the clouds. my heart, once weighed down by sorrow, now pumped with a sudden burst of joy, and i hollered, “wandering spirits, if y’all are out there cruisin’ and not stuck in your boring beds, bestow on me this tiny bit of happiness, or yeet me away from all these mortal yokes!”  
   
as soon as i dropped that truth bomb, i peeped a figure in the distance, a dude advancing toward me at supernatural speed, like he was the glitch in the matrix. he bounced over ice crevices like he was in a crazy video game where every step was a risk; his size, as he neared, looked totally oversized for a human, like a literal titan. i got shook; a fog came over my eyes and i felt all faint, but a blast of cold mountain wind snapped me back to reality, no cap. then, as that eerie shape closed in (a sight so wild and abhorred it made me wanna yeet out of here), i realized—it was the wretch i had spawned, the very creature i had created. i trembled, a mix of rage and horror hit me hard as i vowed to wait for his approach so i could go beast-mode in mortal combat. he came close, and his face screamed bitter anguish mixed with shady disdain and an unearthly ugliness so extra it was almost too much for human eyes; though honestly, i barely processed it, ‘cause my rage and pure hatred had me so numb at first that when i finally found my voice, it erupted in a flood of furious, savage burn after burn.  
   
“devil,” i snapped, “you tryna roll up on me? and don’t you even fear the savage vengeance of my arm about to yeet your sorry head? get lost, vile insect! or better yet, stick around so i can trample you to dust, omg! and oh man, if only i could snuff out your miserable existence, maybe then i could resurrect those victims you diabolically offed, deadass!”  
   
“i expected this kinda reception,” the dæmon rapped, “all humans hate the wretched; so how extra must i be, since i’m, like, more miserable than any livin’ thing?! yet you, my creator, despise and ghost me—your own creation bound by ties that only break if one of us is totally annihilated. you’re fixin’ to off me? how dare you play games with life like that? do your duty toward me, and i’ll do mine for you and all of mankind. if you vibe with my conditions, i’ll leave you and your crew in peace; but if you diss me, i’ll fill the maw of death with the blood of your remaining homies until it’s completely satiated, no cap!”  
   
“abhorred monster! fiend that you are! the tortures of hell are too mild for the retribution your crimes deserve. wretched devil! you blame me for your creation—come on then so i may snuff out that spark i so negligently sparked, yo!”  
   
my rage was off the charts; i sprang on him like a wrecking ball, fueled by every beastly emotion that turns one being against another’s very existence, full-on war mode, deadass!!!  
   
he dodged me slick and was like, “be calm—i’m beggin’ you, listen before you unload all that hate on my sorry mug. have i not suffered enough already that you gotta add to my misery? life, even if just a montage of agony, is still my jam, and i will defend it. remember, you made me, so i’m even more epic than you now—my height’s on point, my joints lit, all flexin’. but i won’t be baited to throw down against you, bro. i’m your creation, so i’ll be chill and docile to my natural lord and king if you hold up your part, which you owe me. oh, frankenstein, don’t act all fair with everyone but come for me alone, ‘cause you owe me that extra dose of justice, mercy, and affection. remember, i am your creation—i should be your adam, but instead i’m the fallen angel you banished from joy for no legit reason. everywhere i peep bliss, i’m the only one left out, irreplaceably excluded. i used to be all benevolent and good, but misery turned me into a straight-up fiend. make me happy, and i’ll be virtuous again, real talk.”  
   
“begone! i ain’t hearing you,” i snapped back. “there’s no community here—we’re enemies. vanish, or let’s throw down, ‘cause one of us is gonna get knocked down, no cap.”  
   
“how can i move you?” he pleaded, “will no sweet talk make you turn a kinda friendly eye toward your own creature who’s beggin’ for your goodness and compassion? believe me, frankenstein, i was once all benevolent—my soul was lit up with love and humanity—but now, am i not alone, miserably alone? you, my creator, straight up abhor me; what hope can i even gather from your fellow humans, who owe me absolutely nada? they just spit on me and hate me. the barren desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my only refuge. i’ve wandered here for days—these icy caves, the only thing i don’t fear, are my crib, the one dwelling man never begrudges. i hail these bleak skies ‘cause they’re kinder to me than your own crew. if the masses ever caught wind of my existence, they’d go off just like you do, gearing up to destroy me. so, should i not then hate those who hate me? i’m settin’ no terms with my enemies—i’m miserable, and they’re gonna share in that wretchedness. yet, it’s all in your hands to make it right and keep them from an evil so colossal that not only you and your fam but thousands more get swallowed up in its wrath. let your compassion be stirred—don’t ghost me. listen to my tale; after you hear it, decide if i deserve your mercy or if you’re gonna blow me off. but listen up: human laws even let the guilty speak for themselves before they’re condemned. hear me, frankenstein: you call me a murderer, yet with a clear conscience you’d destroy your very own creation. oh, praise the eternal justice of man! but i ain’t askin’ you to spare me—just hear my story, and then, if you can and will, go ahead and destroy the work of your own messy hands.”  
   
yo, i shot back, “why you drag out those cringe memories, making it seem like i was the miserable origin and author of all this drama? cursed be the day, abhorred devil, when you first saw the light! cursed (and yeah, i even curse myself) are the hands that formed you! you made me so wretched i can’t even tell if i’m just or not in your eyes—get outta sight and ditch your detestable form!”  
   
“thus i relieve thee, my creator,” he declared, shoving his hated hands in front of my eyes, which i violently yeeted away, “thus i snatch away the sight you loathe. but still, you can listen and maybe drop some compassion my way. by the vibes i once held, i demand this from you—hear my tale; it’s long and wild, and the temp here ain’t exactly tuned for your fine feels; come rock it at the hut on the mountain. the sun’s still high; before it dips behind your snowy cliffs and lights up another world, you’ll hear my story and then decide. it’s on you whether i dip forever from the human hood to live a harmless life or become the curse of your crew and the author of your own speedy downfall.”  
   
as he dropped that line, he led the way across the ice and i followed, heart heavy yet buzzing with curiosity. i didn’t spit a word back, just weighed all his wild arguments and figured i’d at least lend an ear to his tale. partly, my curiosity was lit, and compassion sealed the deal—i’d always pegged him as the suspect behind my brother’s murder, and i was desperate to verify or diss that rumor. for the first time, i even felt the weight of a creator’s duty to his creation, realizing i should’ve tried to make him happy before whining about his wickedness. so, my motives pushed me to meet his demand: we crossed the ice and scaled the opposite rock. the air was mad cold and rain started pourin’ again; we dipped into that hut, him all hyped with that fiendish swagger, me heavyhearted and low, but i agreed to listen. i parked myself by the fire my odious companion had sparked, and there he started droppin’ his tale.  
   
chapter 11

it is with mad difficulty remembering my original era, yo, like my entire existence got lost in a glitchy timeline, all those events just a crazy mashup of blurry memories, deadass mixed up like a laggy livestream; i was hit with a wild overload of feels – i saw, felt, heard, smelt all at once, like sensory overload 3000, and it took forever for my brain to sort out which vibe was coming from which channel, fr fr; then a savage light slammed into my nerves so hard i had no choice but to yeet my eyes shut cuz it was straight up skibidi bright, then darkness slid in like a shady npc, all messing up my mood, but like, no sooner had i been trippin on that dark mode than BOOM – light crashed back in, pouring over me like a tidal wave of extra extra, so i started cruisin, maybe even descended (idk, total chaos), only to find my whole vibe reloaded – before, i was surrounded by dark, opaque blobs that didn’t give a single meme about my touch or sight, but now i was free to wander like a glitchin’ nomad with no obstacles i couldn’t yeet over or bounce around, yo; the light got oppressive AF and the heat was straight up extra, so i was like “i need some chill shade, pronto” – that’s when i hit that ingolstadt forest, crashed by a brook to catch a breather from my epic fatigue, until hunger and thirst came at me like a squad of sus memes, forcing me awake to grub on berries hangin’ on trees or chillin on the ground, then i quenched my thirst at the brook and slid into sleep, exhausted af.

so when i woke up it was dark, and i was cold and half freaked out, like, instinctively feeling super desolate, like an abandoned server, deadass; before i bounced from that space, i’d grabbed some lame clothes to cover up against the cold, but yo, they weren’t enough to block out the night’s dewy drip, so i was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch feeling pain from all sides, plopping down and bawlin like a broken emoticon.

mad soon a chill light stole over the heavens, dropping gentle feels that gave me pleasure like a surprise donation on twitch, so i popped up and peeped a radiant form rising among the trees – the moon, lowkey throwin’ major dab vibes – and i stared with wonder like “deadass, this is epic.” it moved slow-mo, lighting up my path like a legit glow-up, and i bounced off to hunt for more berries, still feeling cold when i found a humongous cloak chillin’ under a tree, which i yeeted over myself and sat on the ground, all while my mind was just a dusky jumble of lights, hunger, thirst, and darkness, with infinite sounds and scents slammin’ in every direction, except for that one bright moon that i clocked with pure pleasure.

after a bunch of day-night remix cycles, when the dark orb had seriously deflated, i started picking apart my feels like a pro – my eyes began catching the real drip of a clear stream (my liquid hookup) and the trees that dropped shade like legit bosses; i was hyped to discover a dope sound, constantly jammin’ in my ears from little winged creatures snaggin’ stray light flashes from my peepers, so i started noticing each form around me and the epic boundaries of that radiant light roof overhead, even trying to mimic the birds’ tunes but straight up failing, and whenever i tried to drop my own savage vibes my off-key noise had me back in silent mode, like glitchin’ out.

lol the moon ghosted from the night and then reappeared in a low-res form while i was still stuck in that forest, and by then my feels were finally uncoupled and clear – my eyes learned to peep objects in their real forms, distinguishing insects from herbs like a legit expert, even splitting one herb from another, and i figured out that sparrows only dropped harsh, mid notes while blackbirds and thrushes were droppin’ sweet, enticing tracks, pure aesthetic gold.

one day, when the cold was oppression mode max, i stumbled on a fire left by wandering beggars – like a crispy accidental plug – and was busted with delight from its warm hug; i got so hyped i yeeted my hand into the live embers, then straight up pulled it back with a loud cry of pain, like “oh my god, stop it!” – so extra that the same cause could drop double opposites, heat and burn, yo; i scoped the fire’s materials and found it was all wood, which totally glad me, so i grabbed some branches, but nah, they were wet and wouldn’t spark, leading to a full-on heartbreak moment as i sat there watching the drama unfold, until my wet wood next to the heat dried out and literally caught fire – mind blown, i keysmashed my way through reflections, touched different branches, figured out the cause, and hustled to collect a crazy stash of wood so i could dry 'em out and always have fire on deck; when night dropped sleep mode hard, i was terrified my fire would ghost, so i carefully covered it with dry wood and leaves, slapped some wet branches over it for that ironic mix, then spread my cloak and crashed on the ground into deep sleep.

morning came and my first mission was to check the fire – i uncovered it and a chill breeze fanned it into a blazing flame, next i whipped up a branch fan to revive the embers when they nearly dipped out; when night approached again, i was stoked to see the fire doing double duty with light and heat, and even got that culinary bonus, coz i found some traveler offals roasted up and tasting way better than my basic tree berries, so i tried to serve my food on the live embers like a gourmet chef, but the berries got totally wrecked while the nuts and roots leveled up into a whole new snack game.

meanwhile, food started being scarce, and i would spend whole days wildin out searching for even a few acorns to calm that hunger gnaw, so i decided to bounce from the spot i’d been crashing at to find somewhere that could feed these basic needs more easily; in this move, i was mega salty over losing that accidental fire plug i’d found and couldn’t recode, so after hours of deep, serious churnin on that problem, i had to give up trying to relight it, bundle up in my cloak, and set off across the wood chasing the setting sun – three days of rambles later, i popped out into open country where a massive snow dump from last night turned the fields all uniform white, looking mad disconsolate, and my feet were straight chilled by the damp, cold mush coating the ground.

around 7 in the morning, mad craving for food and shelter hit me, and i spotted a small hut chillin’ on a rise, prolly built for some shepherd, fresh as hell to my eyes, so i scoped it out with major curiosity, slid in through the open door, and found an old dude posted by a fire preppin’ his breakfast like a boss; but when he heard a noise and peeped me, he shrieked like a banshee and bolted out of the hut, running across the fields at a speed that defied his beaten-down vibe, leaving me totally shook by his wild exit, though i was still vibin on the hut’s aesthetic, which was like a fortress against snow and rain with dry grounds and full chill vibes, almost as divine as pandæmonium reworked for hell’s suffering demons, deadass; i then wolfed down the leftovers of his breakfast – bread, cheese, milk, and a side of wine that i wasn’t feelin – and then, crushed by fatigue, i crashed among some straw and dozed off.

by noon, the sun was blazing on the white ground, and i was all hyped by the warmth to get back on the travel grind; i stashed the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in some found wallet loot and trekked across the fields for hours until sunset dropped and i rolled into a village that looked miraculous – huts, neat cottages, and stately houses flexed their architecture and had me droppin admiration after admiration, while garden veggies, milk, and cheese lined the windows like tempting treats, lighting up my appetite; i stepped into one of these top digs but barely had my foot in when kids went shriek-mode and a woman fainted hard, sending the whole village into chaos – some ran, some attacked, and after i got seriously bruised by stones and other random projectiles, i dipped out to the open country and hightailed it into a low, bare hovel that looked like a total flop compared to the palace-level vibes i’d seen, even though that hovel was attached to a super neat, pleasant cottage that i was too traumatized to enter, so my refuge was a wooden shack low enough that i could barely sit up, with no wood on the floor but just dry earth, and though wind sneaked in through endless crummy chinks, it was still an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain, fr fr.

so i retreated here and crashed happily, grateful for any shelter from the season’s nasty mood and even more from human barbarity; as soon as morning broke, i crept from my little kennel to scope out the adjacent cottage and see if i could stick around in this newfound crib, which was set against the back of the main cottage and hugged by a pig sty and a clear pool – like, one side was open i slid in, but then i covered every potential peep-hole with stones and wood, arranged just right so i could move them if i needed to dip out, while all the light i got was through the pig sty, and that was enough, deadass.

after riggin’ my pad, carpetin’ it with clean straw like a true DIY meme, i retired when i spotted a dude in the distance – and my flashbacks from last night’s drama made me super wary of his power, so i kept it on the down-low; i had already secured my daily munchies with a loaf of coarse bread i swiped and a cup to drink that pure water flowing by my retreat (way better than chuggin’ straight from my hand), and the floor was raised enough to stay dry and cozy near the cottage’s chimney, givin’ off warm vibes.

with these basics locked in, i vowed to crash in this hovel until something wild flipped my determination – it was a straight-up paradise next to the bleak forest, rain-dropping branches, and dank dirt of my old digs; i ate my breakfast with mad pleasure and was about to slide a plank off to fetch some water when i heard a step, and through a tiny chink i peeped a young creature cruising by with a pail on her head, passing right in front of my hovel – this girl was fresh, gentle vibes unlike the later cottager and farmhouse servant memes, even though she was decked out in basic, mean threads – just a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket, her fair hair simply plaited with no extra drip, lookin’ patient but sad; i lost track of her, then about 15 minutes later she came back with the pail now half-filled with milk, and as she trudged along, clearly burdened, a young man met her with a face that said deep despondence, uttering some melancholy sounds as he took the pail off her head and carried it to the cottage himself, and then she followed and they both ghosted – later, i saw the young man again, tools in hand, cruising across the field behind the cottage, while the girl stayed busy, bouncing between inside and yard hustle.

on scoping my dwelling, i noticed one of the cottage’s windows used to be part of my spot until the panes got replaced with wood – in one of these wooden fills there was a teeny, almost unnoticeable crack where a stray eye could sneak through, and beyond that crevice a tiny room showed up, whitewashed and squeaky clean but totally bare of furniture; in one corner near a small fire sat an old man, head in his hands, lookin’ all disconsolate like a sad meme, while the young girl was busy arranging the cottage, then she pulled something out of a drawer to keep her hands busy and sat beside the old man, who then picked up an instrument and started jammin’ out sounds sweeter than any thrush or nightingale remix – such a dope sight even for me, the poor wretch who’d never seen anything beautiful before, deadass; the old dude’s silver hair and kind, benevolent face won my mad respect, and the girl’s gentle manners hit me with heart-eyes so strong that i got hit with a crazy mix of pain and pleasure i’d never felt before – whether from hunger, cold, warmth, or food – and i bailed from the window cuz the feels were just too extra.

soon after, that young man bounced back, shoulders loaded with wood like a true lumberjack meme, and the girl met him at the door to help offload his timber, then scooped some fuel into the cottage and set it on the fire; afterwards, she and the youth split into a cozy nook of the pad where he whipped out a huge loaf and a piece of cheese, flexing some serious snack goals, and she looked hyped, heading into the garden for roots and plants which she dunked in water before tossing them on the fire, then kept up her work while the young man hit the garden hard, busy digging and pulling up roots like a sigma male grindset, and after about an hour the young woman joined him so they bounced back into the cottage together, couple goals on another level.

meanwhile, the old man was deep in his own thoughts, but when his companions showed up he switched to a cheery vibe and they all sat down to chow, demolishing the meal fast like a drive-thru order; the young woman got back to styling the cottage while the old man strolled outside in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the youth’s arm like a soft, sentimental meme, and nothing could match the beauty contrast between these two: one old dude, silver-haired and beaming pure benevolence and love, and the young man, slight and graceful with perfect symmetry yet his eyes screamed deep sadness and despair, total emo mode, so max; then the old man retreated to the cottage while the youth, now sporting even different tools from his morning session, marched across the fields like a dramatic wanderer, no cap.

night slammed in quick as a door smash, but to my extreme wonder i peeped that the cottagers had hacks for everlasting light using tapers – mini candle flex – and i was hella hyped that even when the sun dipped, it didn’t kill my late-night binge-watch of my human neighbors, no chill lost there; in the evenin, the young girl and her companion got busy with tasks that totally went over my head, and then the old man picked up his magic instrument again, droppin divine sounds that hit my feels just like his morning jam, deadass; once he wrapped up his set, the youth started spittin monotone noises that weren’t even close to the harmony of the old man’s tunes or any bird beats – later i found out he was readin aloud, but back then my brain had zero clout in the science of words or letters, glitch mode activated; finally, after a hot minute of doing their thing, the fam put out their lights and peaced out to catch some z’s, as i figured.

chapter 12

i lay on my straw but sleep was a total no-show, lying there deep in thought about the day’s wild rollercoaster, especially struck by the gentle vibe of these people – like, i wanted in on their squad but was too scared to approach, still haunted by the barbaric treatment from last night’s villager drama, so i vowed to stay low in my hovel, lurking and peepin at the motives behind their every move, like full-on detective mode in this chaotic meme life.

the cottagers busted out of bed early, pre-sunrise vibes, with the young woman gearing up the cottage and fixin’ food while the youth dipped out right after the first meal, ghostin’ like he had places to be.

the day just looped in the same routine – the young man was forever out in the wild doing his sigma grind outside while the girl handled a bunch of heavy work inside, and the old man, who i soon clocked was blind (yeah, total blackout), spent his downtime jamming on his instrument or lost in deep contemplation, while the younger cottagers showed mad love and respect to their venerable companion by dishing out every little act of affection and duty with soft, gentle vibes, and he hit them back with those benevolent smiles, pure heart-melter.

but yo, they weren’t all sunshine and rainbows – the young man and his companion sometimes split up and got all teary, crying out low-key, and i couldn’t figure out why they were so down, but it hit me hard: if these seemingly lovely souls can be this miserable, then me – an imperfect, solitary glitch in the matrix – must be the ultimate wretch, big yikes; like, why were these gentle peeps so unhappy? they had what i thought was a dope crib with every luxury – a fire to warm them up when it got chilly, bomb-ass snacks when hunger hit, fresh fly clothes, and the best squad vibes with daily exchanges of affection and kindness, so then what was with their tears? did they really feel pain? i couldn’t crack the code at first, but endless vibe-checks over time slowly explained these mysterious, enigmatic signs.

it took ages before i peeped one major cause of their unease: straight-up poverty, like suffering on a mad level – their entire grub came from garden veggies and milk from one cow that barely delivered during winter, when it was nearly impossible for them to snag enough food; i believe they felt the sting of hunger super hard, especially the two younger ones, who even put food before the old man while keeping none for themselves, which hit me in the feels major time.

that pure trait of kindness moved me hard – i used to stealthily swipe some of their store at night for my own munchies, but when i realized that was hurting their vibe, i dipped from that hustle and stuck with berries, nuts, and roots i gathered from a nearby wood, keeping it all lowkey and simple.

i even discovered another way to help out with their grind – noticed that the youth spent a huge chunk of each day collecting wood for their fire, so at night i’d often snag his tools (which i quickly hacked to use) and haul home enough fire fuel to cover several days, legit secret agent wood hustle.

i remember the first time i did that – the young woman opened the door in the morning and was shook to see a giant pile of wood outside, uttering loud words like a viral tiktok outburst, and then the youth showed up, equally surprised, both of them on that “wtf” vibe; i watched with pure pleasure as he skipped a trip to the forest that day, instead choosing to fix up the cottage and tend the garden, leveling up their homestead game.

by degrees i was like, deadass on that next-level discovery drip yo i peeped that these peeps had a lit method to spill all their feels thru articulate sound memes, no cap, like pure godlike science vibes and i was, like, straight-up craving to get in on that noise lol but every try got me totally lost, fr fr, cuz their mouth game was turbo speed and the words came out all sus with zero connect to any visible deets so i was like, "where’s the cheat code??" aaasjk; after mad hustle and chillin in my crummy hovel for mad moon spins i finally snagged the names for those fam objects—fire, milk, bread, wood—and even clocked the squad: the young buck and his sidekick had a bunch of handles while the old dude was just dad vibes, the girl got tagged sister or agatha and the youth felix, brother, or son, which had me hyped beyond words like pure heart eyes when i dropped those sound codes, though a few extra words like good, dearest, unhappy were still total brain glitches, omg

i spent the whole winter in that vibe, watching the cottagers’ mad gentle manners and insta-worthy beauty, so much that if they were low-key sad i was bummed too and if they were lit with joy i vibed hardcore with them deadass; i barely saw any other homies around and when some random npc crashed the cottage their sus, harsh vibes only made my squad’s epic rep shine harder, lol; big props to the old geezer who always hyped his kiddos up like “yo, yeet that melancholy!” in his cheery accent that even warmed my cringey heart, while agatha stayed all respectful—even wiping away secret teardrops—yet leveled up to happy mode after dad’s inspo, whereas felix was, like, forever on emo mode with his sorrow deep af though his voice still popped up cheerier when he talked to old man, weird but kinda adorable, fr fr

i could spill a ton of tea on these sweet cottagers, like that time in broke life felix yoinked the very first tiny white bloom outta the snowy mess to gift his sis, pure love flex; early morning hustle had him clearing snow from her path to the milk-house, pulling water from the well, and grabbing wood from the outhouse—every time stoked by a ghost hand restocking his stash, omg such mystery, and then sometimes he hustled for a nearby farmer, dipping out until dinner with zero wood haul, while other times he chilled in the garden and read out loud to old man and agatha like bedtime story mode, yeet

that reading had my brain exploding at first but soon i peeped he dropped the same sound bombs when reading as when chatting so i figured he was decoding paper symbols as speech cheat codes i craved to master too—but how can i when the key combos were over my head? i did level up in that language science, but no cap not enough to vibe in full convos even though i poured my whole brain energy into it, cuz i peeped that i shouldn’t yeet myself to the cottagers until i became the ultimate language guru, so they wouldn’t notice my ugly deformed drip that constantly smacked me in the face, omg

i used to stan the perfect forms of my cottager fam—their grace, fine looks, and delicate glow—but omg when i peeped my reflection in a clear pool i legit bailed back like "nah fam, that ain’t me!" and then when i realized i was actually the ugly monster i am, i got hit with a tsunami of bitter, cringe desolation and mega mortification, oh no i had no clue about the catastrophic oof effects of my tragic deformity

when the sun cranked up its warmth and days grew long, the snow yeeted away to reveal bare trees and spooky black dirt, and from that moment felix got extra busy while the looming famine vibes straight up ghosted, their grub turned out rough but hella wholesome with mad supply, new plants popped off in the garden like nature remix and his coziness leveled up daily, fr fr; old man clung to his son like a gigachad support beam, strolling at high noon when the sky wasn’t throwing a water rave, and even when rain hit, high winds dried the earth real quick turning the season into a sunlit chill fest

my hovel life was a repeat loop: mornings i spied on the cottagers in their daily grind then crashed hard when they split up while the rest of the day was pure binge-watching my squad, and when they dipped to rest under moon or star glow, i’d hit the woods to scavenge my own chow and firewood like a lone wolf, then roll back to clear their snow and mimic felix’s boss chores, which got them so shook they’d drop “good spirit, wonderful” like a secret code that i never understood, total vocab enigma

my brain then went full turbo as i craved all the deets on these adorbs creatures’ vibes—like why felix was forever emo and agatha so sad—and i even had that wild thought (foolish wretch, smh!) that maybe i could flip their sad meter to happy mode; while i slept or dipped, visions of old man, sweet agatha, and lovin’ felix danced in my head like a netflix dreamscape, i pictured them as supreme deities calling the shots on my destiny, crafting a thousand savage mental montages of unveiling myself where they’d be grossed out at first but eventually, thanks to my chill vibes and smooth words, come through with love, no cap

these epic feels pumped me so hard that i dove back into the language grind with fresh ardour, even though my voice was rough compared to their soft, angelic beats i still spitted out words i understood even if it was like the ass and the lapdog—stuck between a stubborn vibe and clingy affection that deserved chill treatment over savage blows

then spring dropped with fresh showers and warm, sunny vibes flipping the earth’s aesthetic from bleak cave mode to god-tier crib for nature where folks busted out from caves to flex in arts of cultivation, birds droppin’ cheerful beats and leaves budding like insta-worthy filters—happy earth on full drip that had my mood soaring, wiping the past away and lighting the future with hope and joy rays, legit shimmering dreams

chapter 13

yo now i’m speedin’ to the heart-thumpin’ part of my saga where events bombarded my feels and remixed me into the total glitch monster i am, on god; spring was turbocharged, weather all boss-level fine and skies clear as glass, turning a once gloomy desert into a blooming explosion of flowers and lush green that had my senses lit with a thousand delectable scents and a thousand epic beauty sights, straight vibe overload

on one of these lit days when my squad was chillaxin’—old man jammin on his guitar and the kiddos vibing hard—I peeped felix’s face dripping with melancholy, his constant sighs screaming deep emo while even dad hit pause on his strum, clearly tryna ask “why so sad, bro?” then felix clapped back in a bright tone and just as old man resumed his jam, somebody tapped at the door, wild af

turns out it was a lady ridin’ a horse, chillin’ with a country guide, decked out in a dark suit and rockin’ a thick black veil like a mysterious meme queen; agatha popped off a question but the stranger just softly dropped felix’s name in a sweet accent that was extra smooth, her voice all melodic yet on a diff drip than any of my crew; as soon as that name hit, felix dashed up like ultrafast and when she peeped him she yeeted her veil up revealing a face straight outta angelic beauty with shiny raven braids, dark yet gentle eyes, perfectly balanced features and a complexion lit with rosy cheeks—total diva vibes, deadass

felix was shook, all his emo sorrow ghosted as his eyes sparkled and cheeks flushed with pure delight, making him as stunning as the stranger herself; she, dripping with mixed feels, wiped away a few teardrops and extended her hand, which felix kissed rapturously while calling her his sweet arabian in his own quirky way, though she seemed a bit lost on his words and just smiled, so extra; he then helped her yeet off the horse, dismissed her guide like “bye Felicia” and led her into the cottage where quick convos went down between him and old man while the new guest knelt at old man’s feet almost for a handshake kiss, but got scooped into a big affectionate hug, pure heart flex

i soon clocked that even though the stranger dropped articulate word bombs like her own language drip, she wasn’t vibing with the cottagers—npc language error for real; they were throwing gestures i couldn’t decode, yet her presence diffused mega gladness throughout the crib, yeeting away all sorrow like the sun melting morning mists, and felix beamed extra happy while agatha, ever gentle, blew kisses to the lovely stranger and signaled that her arrival had yeeted out felix’s long-held sorrow, which had his face in constant emo mode until she came in clutch; hours passed with face emojis of joy that left me all confused until i peeped the stranger remixing sounds to learn their lingo and bam my brain was like “i gotta copy that”, as she snagged like twenty words in her first crash course—bonus loot right there

as night dropped agatha and the arabian bounced early while felix planted a big kiss on the stranger’s hand dropping a “good night sweet safie” line and then stayed up chatting with old man, dropping her name like a broken record, making it the hottest topic ever, and i was hyper desperate to decode their convo but ended up with full-on brain freeze, no cap

the next morning, felix bounced off to his grind while after agatha finished her daily ops the arabian chilled at old man’s feet, grabbed the guitar, and strummed tunes so entrancing they legit made my eyes leak both sad and happy tears, like a nightingale dropping rich beats; when she wrapped up, she passed the guitar to agatha who first was like, “nah fam” then played a low-key tune with her sweet voice that, though soft, didn’t match the stranger’s wondrous strain, leaving old man all enraptured and dropping cryptic words that agatha tried to decode for safie—clearly saying her music was the ultimate joy bomb, on god

the days then cruised by in chill peace with sadness yeeted out and pure joy on fleek on my friends’ faces; safie was forever lit and happy while she and i leveled up mad fast on that language grind so that in two months i was catching almost everything my protectors dropped, legit, while the once black ground got covered with lush herbage and green banks sprinkled with endless flowers—like star emojis shining among moonlit woods—the sun cranked up its heat, nights got clear and balmy, and my nocturnal rambles became epic even if shortened by the sun’s early wakeup call cuz i never dared to step out in daylight again after that first village oof

my days were all about mad focus, grinding hard to master the lingo and no cap i leveled up faster than the arabian who still spoke in broken glitchy accents, while i could mimic nearly every word on deck; and as i got better at speech, i also got schooled in the science of letters just as the stranger was taught, which unlocked a vast realm of wonder for my brain, omg

the book felix used to school safie was volney’s ruins of empires—i wouldn’t have caught its tea if felix hadn’t broken it down with all the micro deets, saying its declamatory style was modeled after eastern authors, giving me a cursory history flex and a low-key view of the empires still reppin’ on earth, plus insights into manners, governments, and religions from all over, on god; i peeped tales of lazy asiatics, wild genius grecians, brutal wars and epic virtue of early romans then their mega downfall, plus chatter about chivalry, christianity, kings, and even the discovery of the american hemisphere that had me and safie weepin’ over the tragic fates of its og inhabitants, pure heartbroken feels

all these dope narrations had my feels swirling weirdly—was man really such a wild mix of mega power, noble virtue, and pure magnificence, yet also vicious trash? one minute man was just a spawn of evil vibes and the next he was godlike sigma flex, mind blown; being a great, virtuous bro seemed the highest honor whereas being trash was the ultimate lowdown than a blind mole or worm, and i couldn’t wrap my head around how a dude could just murder a homie or why laws and governments even existed, but once the gory deets of vice and bloodshed spilled, my wonder died and i peaced out with pure disgust, big oof

every single convo with the cottagers spilled new wonders as i soaked in felix’s language lessons to the arabian and got schooled on the wild human society—talks of property splits, massive wealth versus trash poverty, rank, lineage, and noble blood—that made me turn introspective hard; i learned that people prized high-class, unsullied descent plus riches as the ultimate flex and without those, you were labeled a wanderer or slave doomed to waste your talents for the chosen few’s profit, and what was i? clueless about my creation and creator, broke af with no money, no homies, no property, and sporting a hideously deformed, monster look that wasn’t even human, yet i was more agile, could handle rough diets and extreme temps better, towering over them all, and when i peeped around there was no one else like me—so was i just the ultimate monster, a blot on this earth that everyone yeeted away and disowned, big sad, oof

i can’t even spill how much agony those thoughts wrecked me; i tried nuke 'em but every bit of knowledge just upped the sorrow, and oh how i wished i’d stayed forever in my native wood, clueless and vibin’ solely on hunger, thirst, and heat, because knowledge is a weird clingy beast that sticks like lichen on a rock—i sometimes wanted to shake off all thought and feel nothing but learned the only cheat to erase pain was death, a state i feared and totally didn’t get, major existential meltdown, lol

i admired virtue and good feels and loved my cottagers’ gentle ways, but i was forever banned from their inner circle except via stealth ops that only cranked my desire to be one of them to max level, so agatha’s sweet words and the charming arabian’s lit smiles were not meant for my monster ears, nor were old man’s mellow pep talks or felix’s lively chitchat—miserable, unhappy wretch, oof

other lessons slammed in deep as i peeped the diff between sexes, the whole saga of babies growing up with dads doting on their smiles and moms wrapping their entire world in that precious charge, the way youth expanded its brain and how all the sibling and human bonds got tied up tight, but where were my own friends and fam? no dad watching my baby days, no mom dishing out smiles and caresses—if they even existed, my past was just a blank, a void of nothingness, and from day one i was stuck the same with no upgrade, never meeting anyone like me—so like, what even was i? that question kept spamming my brain answered only with groans

i’ll soon drop deets on where all these feels were headed, but for now imma circle back to the cottagers whose saga had my brain exploded with indignation, delight, and wonder, all turning into extra love and reverence for my protectors cuz i, in my naive half-sad self-deceit, loved calling them that

chapter 14

yo so like, after a hot sec of scrolling through my mental feed i peeped the wild lore of my squad and deadass it hit my brain hard like a glitch bomb spillin’ all kinds of extra tea about mad wild sitches that were straight up next-level for a total rookie like me, no cap!!!

so the og dude’s name was de lacey, a legit french bloodline boss flexin’ rich vibes livin’ that affluence grind, mad respected by the boss npcs and loved by squad goals, ya feel me???

his kid was raised to serve the nation like a sigma on a grind and agatha was vibin’ with those high-tier queen feels—like, a few months before i crashed into their orbit they were posted in a lit, boujee city called paris, surrounded by besties and rockin’ every treat virtue, brain finesse, or tasteful drip a moderate fortune could flex!!!

now check this tea: safie’s pops, a turkish merchant on his own wild hustle, was the ultimate oof that doomed the fam vibes – livin’ in paris for mad years until outta nowhere he got super sus to the gov and got caught in 4k, yeeted straight into a prison cell the same day safie dipped in from constantinople to join him. trial went off like a cringe bomb, sentenced him to death and it was clear the whole roast was more about his religion and cash drip than any actual crime, deadass big yikes!!!

so felix, lowkey crashin’ the trial accidentally, got mega shook and pissed off when the verdict dropped – his brain went full meltdown and he vowed on the spot to yeet this dude to freedom. after mad failed attempts to sneak into the prison, he peeped a gnarly grated window in a sketchy part of the building that lit up the dungeon where the unlucky muhammad dude was strapped in chains, waiting in dread for that barbaric death drop. felix slid by at night, dropping his rescue plan to the chained bro, and the turk, shook and hyped, started spittin’ sticky promises of cash and clout to pump up felix’s rescue hustle. but felix, with a side-eye so extra, yeeted those offers hard, though when he caught sight of the stunning safie legally visitin’ her pops and throwin’ those grateful vibes, he peeped that rescuin’ her was like scoring a legendary treasure for his epic risk, fr fr!!!

meanwhile, the turk peeped how his daughter had totally yeeted felix’s feels and tried to secure him hard by pitching a marriage deal as soon as he got to safety, promising her hand like it was the ultimate flex. felix was too soft to take that route, yet lowkey he was starry-eyed for that ultimate glow-up to complete his happiness, deadass!!!

in the next wild days while schemin’ the merchant’s escape, felix’s heart got a glow boost from a stack of fire letters from the gorgeous safie, who dropped her thoughts in her lover’s lingo through an old-school french dude (her dad’s servant, smh) – she spilled dank thanks for his rescue vibe for her parent while lowkey whinin’ about her own savage fate!!!

yo i even got copies of these drip letters coz i managed to score some ancient scribble tools in my dank hovel and felix or agatha had ‘em on lock. before i yeet out, imma drop them on yall as solid proof my tale isn’t some fake meme; but right now, with the sun low and vibes dim, i can only spill the main tea!!!

safie then spilled that her mama was this christian arab queen, snatched and turned into a turkish slave, but her epic beauty was straight flex that even won the heart of safie’s dad who married her. the young queen went on wild about her mama’s rebel vibes—born free and straight-up ghostin’ oppression, teachin’ her daughter a boss-level mix of faith and independent genius that muhammad’s squad never got to flex on. even though her mama dipped out, her savage wisdom stayed insta-printed in safie’s brain, and the thought of goin’ back to asia and bein’ stuck in a harem with childish distractions totally made her cringe. the dream of marrying a christian and livin’ in a land where queens could shine in society was the ultimate fairytale for her, no cap!!!

so the day for the turk’s execution was set, but lowkey the night before he dipped outta his cell and by dawn he was ghostin’ leagues away from paris. felix copped fake passports for his whole fam – his old man, his sis, and himself, and even clapped with his pops who dipped his own crib under the guise of a quick trip and hid in some shady paris corner with his daughter, pure stealth mode!!!

felix then yeeted the escape crew through france to lyons and bounced across mont cenis to leghorn, where the merchant planned to chill till the opportune moment popped to crash into some turkish turf, mega suspense vibes!!!

safie decided to stick with her dad until he bounced, ‘cause the turk re-dropped his promise that she’d be matched up with her savior, and felix stayed on deck with them, waiting for that bomb drop; in the meantime, he was vibin’ with the arabian dude who hit him with mad tender feels. they rapped using a translator (and sometimes even just with looks, like wordless emojis) while safie belted out some divine native jams that straight-up melted hearts!!!

the turk let this cozy scene roll and even hyped up those young love feels while secretly plot-trolling in his chest – he straight up hated the idea of his daughter linking with a christian but was shook to think felix might throw shade if he wasn’t totally fired up, knowing full well that felix held the power if he snitched to the italian state. he cooked up like a thousand sneaky schemes to keep the scam on lockdown until it wasn’t needed anymore and planned on secretly snatching his daughter when he bounced. all this plotting got easier when fresh tea from paris dropped, no joke!!!

the french gov was hella enraged at the escape drama of their victim, going full throttle to snitch out and clout the rescue dude. felix’s master plan got caught quick, and de lacey along with agatha were tossed into a dank dungeon. when the bitter news hit felix, it yanked him awake from his pleasure dream—his old, blind pops and gentle sis were locked up while he was out livin’ his free air vibe with his bae. total torture, like pure inner fire. he quickly struck a deal with the turk: if the dude found a slick way to escape before felix could dip back to italy, then safie was to be left boardin’ a convent in leghorn. then, ditchin’ that sweet arabian vibe, felix high-tailed his way to paris and turned himself in for a righteous legal clout move, hopin’ that act could free de lacey and agatha, fr fr!!!

but yo, he straight failed – they stayed locked up for five savage months til trial dropped, which sucked away their coin and banished them to forever exile from their homeland, mega tragic vibe!!!

they ended up stuck in a miserable asylum in a wack cottage in germany, where i found ‘em, legit. felix soon peeped that the backstabbing turk – for whom he and his fam endured unheard-of suffering – upon discoverin’ that his rescue dude got left broke and in ruins, flipped full traitor on good vibes and honor, bouncin’ from italy with his daughter and insultin’ felix by sendin’ him a crumb of cash as if that could prop him up for some future scam, straight savage, no cap!!!

all that mess preyed deep on felix’s soul, makin’ him when i first peeped him the ultimate sadboi of his fam—even though he could’ve been down with poverty and even glorified that struggle as a badge of honor, the ultimate betrayal of that turk and the loss of his bomb safie were next-level wounds, irreparable and bitter. then the arrival of the arabian dropped fresh life into his soul like a power-up in a glitchy game, deadass!!!

when the leghorn tea hit that felix was stripped of his coin and clout, the merchant boss straight commanded his daughter to forget her lover and gear up to dip back to her roots. safie’s generous heart got mad triggered by that order; she tried drop some fire rebuttal to her dad, but he yeeted her off with pure anger, reiterating his dictator-level mandate, no chill!!!

few days later the turk busted into his daughter’s crib and blurted out that he’d peeped intel his leghorn pad was snitched – and that he was gonna be hauled up by the french gov ANY minute now. he spilled that he’d copped a ship to jet off to constantinople in just a few hours and planned to ditch his daughter with a hush-hush servant, promising to come back later with most of his loot that hadn’t even landed in leghorn yet, mega sketch!!!

when solo, safie locked in her own emergency game plan – because livin’ in turkey was a total nah, her faith and feels straight-up rejected it. snaggin’ some papers that fell from her dad’s stash, she caught word that her boo was exiled and even learned his new drop’s name. she hesitated a hot minute, but then locked in her decision: grab her bling and some cash and yeet out of italy with a leghorn local who could rap turkey lingo, then bounce straight to germany, no cap!!!

safie landed safe in a town like twenty leagues from de lacey’s crib, but then her attendant got super ill, dangerously so. she poured all her devoted love into nursing the poor soul, but the attendant sadly dipped, leaving the arabian stranded, clueless about the local lingo and totally noob on world customs. even so, she fell into some good hands—an italian had already dropped the destination deets, and after the attendant’s tragic exit, the house lady from their crib made sure safie got safely yeeted to her lover’s cottage, straight up care package vibes!!!

chapter 15

yo this was the wild saga of my beloved cottage crew, and it hit me deep af, real talk. i learned from all that social flex that i had to stan their dope virtues and roast the weak, basic vices of humanity, no cap!!!

back then i saw crime as some far-off sus villain vibe while all that benevolence and generosity was poppin’ off in front of me, hyping me to star in this busy real-life tiktok drama where mad epic qualities shined. but listen up—as i start spittin’ the tea on my brain’s glow up, i gotta drop that one insane moment from august of that same wild year, deadass!!!

one night on my usual grind in the neighborhood woods, scavengin’ for my own chow and stockin’ firewood for my protectors, i stumbled on a vintage leather duffel bag just chillin’ on the ground, loaded with dope threads and a stack of books. i snatched that prize like it was free merch and yeeted it back to my crummy hovel. lucky break—the books were in the language i picked up at the cottage; i ended up with paradise lost, plutarch’s lives, and the sorrows of werter. owning that lit treasure made me buzz mad hard, and i spent endless hours diving into these epic histories while my squad was caught up in their basic day-to-day flex!!!

i can barely even vibe with how these pages blasted my brain with endless new images and feels—sometimes they yeeted me to ecstasy, but most times they slammed me down into a bottomless pit of gloom. in the sorrows of werter, aside from its raw, heart-tuggin’ story, a maze of opinions and insights got lit up on subjects i never even peeped before, turning that book into an eternal meme of mind-blowing thoughts. the chill domestic vibes mixed with lofty feels totally resonated with my own squad experiences, and i legit thought werter was a next-level divine icon—no pretense, just deep, raw feels. his deep dives into death n suicide had me wonderin’ in total awe, and even though i wasn’t about to debate his views, i lowkey soaked his vibe and wept for his loss, even if i didn’t fully get it, deadass!!!

as i flipped pages, i started droppin’ those chaotic feels onto my own glitchy soul—like, i was both vibin’ with the characters and yet totally not like them, a straight-up enigma. i sympathized and kinda understood them, but my mind was all unformed and solo af, totally independent and disconnected. “the path of my departure was free” they said, but who’s gonna cry for my epic annihilation? my form was a beastly hot mess, total hideous glitch with gigantic proportions—so like, what even did that mean? who am i, what am i, where did i even come from, and where was i headed? these questions kept spamming my brain like a broken app and i couldn’t crack the code, bruh!!!

now the plutarch’s lives book i copped was a whole different level—it was all about the OG founders of ancient republics, flexin’ stories that lifted me way above the sad feels of werter’s gloom. while werter had me wallowing in dark vibes, plutarch boosted me with high-key inspo, elevating me to stan the ancient heroes like total legends. i read about kingdoms, vast lands, mighty rivers, and endless seas—stuff that went way past my small-town school of life at the cottage. it painted a whole action-packed saga of dudes running state affairs, droppin’ bodies like memes, and i felt my heart light up with virtue and full-on disdain for vice, even if it was all about simple pleasure and pain. all that fire got me to revere chill lawgivers like numa, solon, and lycurgus over savage romulus and theseus—my protectors’ humble vibes had me wired, and if my first intro to humanity had been through a glory-hungry soldier on a bloodthirsty rampage, i’d have caught totally different feels, swear!!!

but yo, paradise lost hit different—it unleashed deep, mad emotions in me. i read it like it was the ultimate true history, and it moved every part of my being with the epic showdown of an omnipotent god battlin’ his creations. i kept comparin’ its wild scenes to my own life; like, i was an adams clone, completely solo with zero links to anyone, while his gig was flawless—crafted by god into a perfect being, happy, thriving, and always under his creator’s VIP care, chattin’ it up with superior peeps. me? i was broken, helpless, and mad lonely. so many times i felt that satan was the real emblem of my condition, cuz every time i peeped my protectors’ bliss my envy surged hard, like toxic and unstoppable, yo!!!

then, boom, another cray moment doubled down on these feels—shortly after i crashed into my dump, i copped some crumpled papers tucked in the pocket of a dress i snagged from your lab. at first, i totally ghosted ‘em, but once i decoded that ancient scribble, i got deep into your journal from the four months pre-my-creation, every micro-detail of your wild science hustle mixed with basic home drama. you probs remember those scraps—here they are, spillin’ all the nasty deets on my cursed origin; every grim and gross minute of the chaos that built me is laid out in raw, unfiltered language that painted your own horrors and branded my existence forever. i was so dead inside readin’ it i yelled, “ugh, hateful day when i caught life!” and practically screamed, “cursed creator! why did you yeet this monster so hideous that even you couldn’t stand me? god, in your pity, made man beautiful and all that, but my look is just a trashy knockoff of yours, even more cringe in every way. satan had his devil squad to hype him up, but here i am, stuck solo and loathed, a total glitch in the system,” mad agony vibes!!!

that was the raw, cringy echo of my darkest, loneliest hours—but then i peeped the cottagers’ chill, super kind energy and got hyped that if they ever caught me vibin’ with their epic goodness, they’d have mercy on my monstrous self and overlook my ugly glitch. like, could they really slam the door on me, even if i was a total mess beggin’ for their squad love? i vowed not to give up, but to level up enough for a face-to-face that’d decide my fate. i held off that meetup for a few more months cuz the pressure was real and i was mad scared of floppin’—plus, every day my brain leveled up more, so i wasn’t ready to drop the call until i had a few extra months of wisdom, deadass!!!

meanwhile, at the cottage all the drama shifted: safie’s bright energy spread mad joy, and the place started vibin’ on a higher frequency of plenty—even if felix and agatha weren’t rollin’ in coin, they were chill and happy with smooth, serene feels while my inner storm just kept turnin’ up the volume. every new bit of knowledge only fixed the fact that i was a total outcast. i held on to hope for a bit, but it always ghosted me when i caught my reflection in a puddle or saw my shadow under the moon, like a weak, inconstant meme that just wasn’t enough, no cap!!!

i hustled to crush those fears and bulk up for the epic trial i was destined to face in a few months; sometimes my mind would go off on wild, unchecked rants, dreamin’ of a paradise full of cute, chill peeps who would vibe with my feels and lift my mood with those angelic smiles of pure comfort. but yo, it was all just a daydream—no eve ever stepped in to soothe my sorrow or share my dark memes; i was totally alone. i even remembered how adam begged his creator, but where was my call for help? he straight bailed, and in my bitter meltdown i cursed him hard, for leaving me in this endless glitch!!!

peace.

autumn passed thus omg asdfgh i saw leaves straight up decaying n falling like total drama and nature threw on its bleak drip mode deadass just like when i first peeped the woods n that lush moon, smh  
but yo i totally ignored the icy gloom vibes cuz my build’s more lit for cold survival than that tropical heat flex, no cap fr fr  
and bruh my main flex was the squad of flowers, birds, n all that summer drip aesthetics; when summer ghosted, i turned all in on the cottagers like they were my ride-or-die fam, yeet sksksk  
the cottagers were vibin’ hard even without summer’s fire – they were lovin’ n feelin’ each other’s best memes so even the chaos around them couldn’t glitch their squad energy, legit  
the more i peeped them the more my soul was like “gimme dat protection n mad kindness” cuz my heart was cravin’ those sweet, adorbz vibes and a spot in their squad, omg i legit needed that affirmation 4k  
i was too shook to think they’d yeet me with disdain n horror – even broke souls knockin’ at their door got that mad welcome, deadass; i only needed some major feelz n kindness, not a buffet of grub, ya know? i believed i deserved dope vibes, no cap  

then winter rolled in full remix mode since my grand viva and i was all in on schemin’ to slide into my protectors’ crib lol i had a bunch of wild plans but lowkey decided i gotta sneak in when the blind old dude is solo caught in 4k vibes fr  
tbh i peeped that my extra ugly, sus body was majorly sketch to those who once saw my glitchy self so i figured my rough voice ain’t the bug that sends peeps running; so if that old de lacey—unbothered by kid drama—could vouch for me when his minis were away then maybe i could snag some tolerance from the young squad like a total gigachad of survival, yeet  

so one dope day when the sun flexed on red leaves scattered all over like an aesthetic drip—cheerful yet no warmth bc real talk—safie, agatha, n felix dipped on a long country sesh leaving the old man chillin’ solo in his cottage self-care mode, deadass  
when his lil squad bounced, our blind dude grabbed his guitar and dropped some hella sad but sweet tunes that were off the charts like next level emo vibes; at first his face lit up with chill pleasure then slowly switched to deep feels and eventually he ditched the strumming to zone out in total introspection, skibidi fr  

my heart was racing like mega rapid fire cuz this was the ultimate trial moment deciding if i’d level up my dreams or get roasted by fears while the servants dipped to a local fair and the pad was ghost silent—prime stealth op vibes—but as i tried to flex my plan, my limbs straight up failed me and i crashed on the ground, omg so extra  
but no cap i bounced back powering up like a sigma grindset, yeeting off those planks i’d stashed to hide my retreat, fresh air boosting me back on track so i marched right up to that cottage door with mega determination, asdfgh pure hustle  

i rapped the knox and the old man was all “who’s hitting that door tho?” then he was like “slide in!”  
i busted in, all chill, saying “pardon this intrusion, my bad for crashin’ but i’m just a traveler starvin’ for some zzz’s; your vibes would be lit if you could hook me up with a few minutes by the fire,” deadass  
de lacey responded like “yo, step in i’ll do my best to help ya, but heads up my kiddos are home now and since im blind snagging you some grub might be mad sus so sorry fam”  
i clapped back “nah, chill my host, i got my own munchies; i’m just cravin’ that fire vibe n some rest, for real, no cap”  

i plopped down and the silence was next level awkward af; every tick was prime but my brain was buffering on how to kick off this convo until the old man dropped in:  
“by your language stranger, i suppose u might be my homeboy; so tell me, you french?”  
i shot back “nope, but got schooled by a french fam so i can spit that lingo; i’m here to claim some friend protection from my true ride-or-die squad that i legit stan, hope’s on fleek, fam”  
old dude then asked “so like, are they germans?”  
i replied “nah they’re french, so switching lanes – im a total abandoned creature roaming with zero fam on this planet, and these cool peeps i’m chasing ain’t seen my glow so i’m shook that if i flop, i’m destined to be an eternal npc in this world, smh”  

de lacey then dropped wisdom “yo no cap bein friendless sucks but real ones got mad brotherly love without the sus self-interest so keep riding those hopes and if your crew is chill don’t despair”  
i vented “they’re kind – the absolute bosses of this world – but yo they got major bias against me; i’m all good vibes, harmless even on the low, but a fatal bias has ‘em glitch out and see only a sketchy monster instead of a friend with feelings, deadass”  
the old man then asked “aw man, that sucks but if you truly ain’t dirty, why not flip their script and undeceive them?”  
i vibed back “yeah, im bout to go all in on that, which is why i’m flooded with terror rn cuz i lowkey love these friends and have been secretly dishing daily kindness for months, but they think im tryna sus them and that bias is the glitch i need to fix, omg fr”  
when asked “so where’s this squad at?” i answered “straight up near this spot, fam”  

de lacey paused then said “if you spill all the deets of your wild tale unfiltered, i might help flip their mindset cuz i can’t see your drip but your words tell me you’re real; im poor and exiled but it’d be lit to serve a human in need, no cap”  
i was like “this is bussin, my dude! thanks a ton, you legit lift me from the dust and with your help i hope not to be yeeted from human society, deadass”  
he then went “heaven forbid! even if you were sketchy, that only makes you desperate not saintly; i feel you because im unfortunate too – me and my fam are condemned though clean so judge me if i don’t vibe with your misfortunes”  
i then cried “how can i thank you, my sole benefactor? your lips dropped the first kindness bomb on me and i’ll forever be grateful; your humanity is the plug that assures me of winning my soon-to-be squad, legit”  
de lacey then asked “ay, can i get the deets on their names and crib loc, fam?”  
i paused hard cuz this moment was a major decision moment that could either bestow eternal happiness or forever ghost my vibe; i battled to answer but my energy completely zapped so i crashed on the chair bawling out loud, then i heard the footsteps of my young protectors and without a sec to lose i grabbed de lacey’s hand screaming “now’s the moment! save n protect me! you and your fam are the squad i need so don’t ghost me in this trial, fam!”  
de lacey lost it yelling “great god, who even r u?!”  
at that moment the cottage door popped open and felix, safie, n agatha rolled in with total horror plastered all over their faces; agatha straight up fainted and safie, unable to cope, dashed out while felix charged like a wild beast snatching me off de lacey’s knees then slamming me to the ground and whacking me with a stick, full savage mode activated like a lion ripping an antelope, but then my heart dipped into bitter sickness so i held back and when i saw him about to land another blow i bailed from the cottage in a blur of pain and chaos and escaped back to my hovel, gg  

chapter 16

cursed, cursed creator! like why was i even alive, why didn’t i yeet out that spark of life you just dumped on me so wantonly, idk honestly; i wasn’t even in full despair yet – just mad with rage and revenge vibes and i could’ve straight up wrecked that pad and all its peeps, feasting on their shrieks n misery, no cap  
when night caught up, i yeeted outta my retreat and roamed the woods, free from the fear of getting caught, unleashing wild howls like a beast on a rampage breaking every chain and destroying obstacles with stag-like speed, omg what a miserable night, cold stars laughed like trolls and bare trees waved their branches in a weird dance while some chill bird dropped sweet beats in the eerie silence, sksksk  
everyone else was either crashing or vibing in peace but i, like a total arch-fiend, had a hellstorm rumbling inside and since i got zero love around, i wanted to rip up trees, spread pure havoc n destruction then sit back and enjoy the ruin, total meltdown mode  
but yo that extra savage vibe couldn’t last; i got beat down from all that physical flex and crashed on the damp grass in pure despair as exhaustion hit hard, with not a single soul in the billions ready to help or even pity me; and why be kind to my haters? nah from that moment i declared war on all mankind and especially on the dude who spawned me and doomed me to this insufferable misery, deadass  
the sun rose and i heard human voices so i knew i couldn’t dip back to my hidey-hole in the day, so i ghosted into some thick underwood to deep-think about my savage sitch, omg  
the sunny vibes and fresh air calmed me a bit and when i replayed the cottage drama in my mind i realized i was too hasty, acted mad imprudently exposing my glitchy self to his kids’ horror when i should’ve slowly schooled de lacey ‘bout my existence so the fam could be prepped – but i stayed hopeful my screw-ups weren’t permanent and decided to slide back into the cottage, hunt the old man down, and flex my charm to win him over to my squad, for real  
those deep feels chilled me out and by afternoon i zonked into a profound sleep but my blood fever kept me from any peaceful dreams as that horrific day replayed on loop—the girls running, felix raging, ripping me off his dad’s grip—and i woke up wrecked, and seeing it was night again i stealth crept out from my hide, on a hunger quest for some grub, sksksk  
once i stuffed my face, i peaced my steps toward the familiar path to the cottage where everything was chill; i snuck back to my hovel waiting silently for the fam’s wake-up call, but the hour passed, the sun climbed high, yet no cottagers appeared and i trembled like major lag expecting epic doom, the inside of the pad dark and silent—a suspense agony that was pure, omg  
then two country homies strolled by, paused near the pad, and started wild gesticulations in their own rural dialect i couldn’t even decode, then shortly felix rolled in with another dude which was sus since i knew he hadn’t left that morn so i was hella anxious to decode his chatter on these extra appearances, like fr  
his sidekick was like “yo you think you gotta cough up three months’ rent and lose all your garden loot? i ain’t tryna pull any shady moves so please take a few days to decide,” and felix snapped “it’s 100% useless, we can never crash in your cottage again – my dad’s life is in mega danger thanks to this crazy mess i just spilled, and my wife n sis will be traumatized for life; i beg you, stop reasoning with me and just take back your crib so i can bounce from this place,” with felix visibly shaking as he dropped these words and then he and his mate yeeted into the cottage for a hot minute before dipping for good, and tbh i never peeped de lacey fam again, omg  
i spent the rest of the day in my hovel drowning in stupid despair, my protectors ghosted and snapping the only tether to humanity so for the first time revenge n pure hate filled my chest and i let it ride wild without control, my mind aimed at causing injury n death; then when i thought of my once-friends – de lacey’s soft talk, agatha’s gentle eyes, and that arabian beauty – those vibes vanished into teardrops that chilled me, but then realizing they ditched me, anger came roaring back and since i couldn’t hurt actual humans, i yeeted all my fury onto inanimate stuff, pure rage manifested on objects, omg  
as night deepened i rigged up a load of combustibles around the cottage and trashed every bit of the garden’s cultivation then sat there impatiently waiting for the moon to dip so i could commence my savage ops, deadass  
then as the night got even wilder a mega fierce wind burst from the woods, blasting away loitering clouds like a savage avalanche and flipping my mind into total insanity that broke all bounds of reason, so i lit a dry branch like a match and went berserk dancing around the pad, eyes locked on the western horizon where the moon nearly touched the edge, skrrt skrrt  
i watched as part of that orb got hidden, so i whacked my brand and it dropped, then with a loud, wild scream i set straw, heath, n bushes on fire that i had hoarded, while the wind cranked the flames so fast that the whole cottage got swallowed by fire with its tongues licking it like forked destruction, omg  
as soon as i was like “lol no help coming” i dipped out the scene and bolted into the woods for refuge, pure ghost mode activated  
and then with the world sprawled out before me i was like “where do i even bounce to?” i vowed to fly far from this disaster zone of misfortunes but to me every country is trash ‘cause im hated and cursed so then a wild thought hit me: you, my twisted creator, popped into my brain bc according to your papers u were my dad, my creator so who else to holler at than the one who spawned me? in felix’s lessons to safie geography was in play so i got the lowdown on earth’s country vibes and u dropped geneva as your hometown so i locked on that destination, yeet  
but like how do i navigate even then? i knew i had to roll southwest to hit geneva but the sun was my only gps, lol i didn’t have the deets on town names and couldn’t ask a single human cuz they’d probably roast me, but i stayed in the game; only u, oh twisted unfeeling creator, could drop any succor even though my heart’s filled with hatred for u – u dumped mad perceptions n feelings on me then chucked me out as a meme for mankind’s scorn so only u can throw me pity and justice, and from u i’m gunning for that redemption that no other human form could deliver, smh  

my journey was hella long and the sufferings were intense af; late autumn saw me ghosting the district i’d called home, traveling only at night scared of bumping into human faces, as nature decayed around me, the sun became all heatless, rain n snow poured like wild torrents, mighty rivers iced over, the earth’s surface turned hard n bare with zero shelter, omg earth i cursed my very existence on loop, my soft vibes replaced by bitter gall, and the closer i got to your crib the more my revenge spirit flamed up, even as snow fell and water stiffened i didn’t rest a sec; random incidents pointed my way and though i had a wobbly map, i wandered off path constantly, my pain feeding my rage non-stop until when i hit the swiss border with the sun warming up and the earth turning green it confirmed just how bitter and horrifying my feels had become, deadass  
i usually crashed by day and only hit the road at night to stay hidden from the human lens, but one morning as my path cut through a deep wood i dared to keep on even after sunrise; it was one of those first spring days that lit up everything with loveliness and balmy vibes that even got me hyped, making me feel gentle joy that i thought was long dead, so half surprised i rode that wave, forgetting my solo ugly meme life and daring to be happy, shedding soft teardrops while raising my damp eyes in mad thanks to the blessed sun for that rare joy, omg  
i kept winding through the forest paths until i hit its edge where a deep rapid river flexed with trees bending their fresh spring buds, and i chilled there not knowing which way to roll when suddenly i heard voices so i ducked under a cypress shade to hide, barely concealed when a young girl sprinted up laughing like she was dodging drama, then continued along the steep river banks until her foot went skrrt and she slipped into the rapids, omg so sus; i bolted from hiding and fought the current to haul her to shore, though she was out cold, and i hustled every bit to revive her, when outta nowhere a rustic dude—probably the one she playfully fled from—burst in, charged at me, snatched her from my arms, and dashed into the deep woods, and i chased him full speed no idea why until he spotted me and pulled a gun and fired, sending me crashing to the ground while he yeeted deeper into the forest, total chaos, gg  
and yo that was the savage reward for my kindness! i saved a human from destruction and got slammed with a brutal wound that shattered my flesh n bone leaving me writhing in pain; the tender vibes i had moments before flipped to pure hellish rage with teeth gnashing like a glitchy machine, and fired up by that pain i swore eternal hate n vengeance on all mankind but the agony was so extra it stopped my pulses and i straight up fainted, deadass

for some weeks i was straight up lost in the woods, deadass tryna fix that gnarly wound i got cuz a ball yeeted into my shoulder lol idk if it stayed or yeeted through and extraction was a total noob move!!! my pain got extra loaded with sus vibes of injustice and major ingratitude so every day i vowed a savage revenge—a deep, deadly clapback to roast all the outrage and soul-crushing drama i endured, no cap!!!

after a hot minute, my wound lowkey mended so i bounced on my journey but yo, the sun and chill spring breezes were canceled vibes—every bit of joy was just a clown mockin my bleak feels, reminding me i was never built for pleasure, deadass big yikes!!!

btw my relentless grind was nearing the end and in like two months i rolled up in the geneva zone, fr fr!!!

it was lowkey evenin when i landed so i dipped into a secret hidey-hole in the fields to flex my brain on how to slide into your dms, ya feel? tired af, hungry, and drowning in emo feels, not vibin with the breeze or that epic sunset behind the stupendous jura mountains, omg!!!

then mid chill sleep break from my overthinking meltdown, this fresh lil baby came running in all sporty with full infant energy—no cap, he was runnin wild like a skeet on turbo mode!!! as i peeped his vibe, a wild idea hit me hard: this little dude was totally npc-free, too young to catch any deformed glitch, so i thought, “yo, snag him and educate him into my ride-or-die, so i ain't alone in this messed-up world,” deadass!!!

real quick, my impulsive gut was like, grab that kid so i snatched him up as he passed and pulled him close. the moment he peeped my wild, chaotic look he went full alarm mode, hands covering eyes, shriekin like a banshee on loop!!! i yanked his hand off and was all, “yo kiddie, chill fr, i ain't tryna hurt u, just hear me out, deadass!”

but the kid popped off, struggling madly: “let me go, monster! ugly wretch! u tryna snack on me and shred me to bits? u are a straight up ogre, let me go or imma call my papa, fr fr!”  

i clapped back, “boy, u are done—your dad's ghosted forever, so u gotta roll with me, no cap.”

kid kept wreckin’ it: “hideous monster, lemme bounce! my papa’s a syndic—yeah, m. frankenstein, and he’s gonna clobber u hard, so don’t even try to hold me, period!”

i shot back, “frankenstein, u’re on my nemesis hit list now cuz i swore eternal revenge on him and u’re gonna be my first victim, deadass!”

the kid kept flingin insults, lowkey loading mad despair vibes my way; i grabbed his throat to shut him up and boom—a glitch moment—dead at my feet, omg rage mode activated!!!

i peeped my casualty and my heart exploded with savage triumph, clappin mad claps as i declared, “i too can chef up desolation; my enemy ain’t invincible—this death’s gonna rain despair on him and a thousand other miseries will come through to obliterate him, on god fr fr!”

while i was peepin that dead kid, i spotted some bling on his chest—snatched it lickety-split—it was a pic of a super fine queen. even my toxic vibes got all soft and melted a bit for her: her dark eyes with deep lashes and those luscious lips had me like, “dang, that’s fire!” but then rage spiked back hard as i remembered i was forever robbed of the delights such babes bring, and that she, if she peeped me, would flip my divine vibes to pure disgust and straight-up horror, no cap!!!

seriously, can u even imagine my brain went full meltdown rage mode? i’m only shook that instead of venting every exclamation in agony, i didn’t just yeet myself into mankind to destroy them all, like epic self-roast disaster—omg, what a flex of inner turmoil!!!

riding that emo wave, i dipped from the murder scene and slid into a sketchy barn that looked totally empty, deadass. inside, a chick was snoozin on straw—young and with cute fresh vibes, not as bomb as that fine queen from the portrait but still hella agreeable—spreading joy everywhere except on my lonely soul. so i leaned over, all sus, whispering, “awaken, fairest, thy lover is near—i’d give my whole life just for one look of your affection, my beloved, wake up!” total cringe overload!!!

the snooze queen stirred and terror hit me like a glitch; i was lowkey shakin thinkin’, what if she wakes, sees me, and curses me for that murder spree? like, if her dark eyes opened and caught my chaotic form, she’d roast me hardcore!!! pure madness, triggering the fiend in me: not me, but she is gonna suffer for depriving me of all the beauty she could've given—karma’s a savage, and her punishment is on, fr fr!!! thanks to felix’s savage lessons and the blood-soaked laws of man, i had mastered the art of mischief; i slid the queen’s pic snug into a fold of her dress, and as she twitched awake, i yeeted myself out, omg!!!

for days i ghosted that murder spot, oscillating like some major mood—sometimes craving a rendezvous with u, sometimes wanting to yeet myself from this miserable world forever, deadass. eventually, i hustled towards these wild mountains, roaming their massive crannies, consumed by a burning passion that only u can satisfy, on god!!! we ain’t ever parting till u promise to hook me up with what i need: i’m alone, miserable, society’s a bunch of NPCs, but one as deformed and epic as me won’t ghost me—my ride-or-die gotta be in the same messed-up club. yo, this being, u gotta create it, period!

chapter 17

yo the being wrapped up his spiel and fixed his glare on me, expectin a savage reply, but i was completely shook, baffled asf, my brain glitchin so hard i couldn’t piece together his wild proposition, deadass. he went on, 

“u gotta whip up a female for me so i can live in that epic interchange of vibes necessary for my existence, ya feel? only u got the clout to do it, and i demand it like a legit right that u can’t just refuse, no cap!”

that last part lit my rage reboot—my chill from his cottager peace story totally canceled, so i couldn’t hold back the fury bubbling inside, full meltdown mode activated!!!

i clapped back madly, “i do refuse it, period—no torture or savage scheme is gonna force a yes outta me. u can drop me into the depths of misery but i ain’t ever gonna make me base in my own eyes, fr fr! should i summon another like u, whose combined wickedness triggers world destruction? bounce, cuz i answered: torture me all u want but my consent is locked at zero!”

the fiend snapped, “yo, u twisted it—i’m not here throwing weak threats; i’m down to break it down: i’m malicious cuz i’m miserable, shunned and despised by every human out there, ya dig? u, my creator, would shred me to bits and flex that win, so tell me why i should give a damn about man more than they do for me? u wouldn’t even tag it as murder if u could yeet me into an ice-rift and smash my frame—crafted by your own hands, deadass! should i respect mankind when they condemn my vibe? let 'em chill with me in some kind interflow, and instead of harm, i’d drop mad benefits with tearful gratitude if they accepted me—yet that’s impossible because human feels are these insane, unbreakable walls stopping our union! and still, i won’t bow down to abject slavery; imma revenge every burn—if i can’t spark love, imma trigger fear, mainly towards u, my arch-enemy, cuz my creator, i swear on the meme gods, i got inextinguishable hate boilin’! heads up; imma work on your destruction and won’t stop until i ruin your heart so hard that u curse the very moment u were born, fr fr!”

yo, fiendish rage had him lit, his face twisted in contortions too gnarly for human eyes, but then he chilled and kept on spittin’—

“i meant to reason, but this inner fire is killin me, cuz u ain’t see that u fueled its excess, lol. if any homie felt kind vibes towards me, i’d return it a hundredfold—seriously, for that one peep, i’d make peace with the entire squad! but now i’m stuck dreamin’ of bliss that’s never gonna drop. what i ask is lowkey reasonable and moderate; i demand a creature of the other gender, but as hideously epic as me—small gratification that’s all i can take, and it’d fill my void, no cap. yeah, we’ll be monsters, cut off from the world, but that means we’re even tighter, bonded hardcore. our lives won’t be a constant banger, but at least they’ll be harmless and free from the misery i’m drowning in now. oh my creator, make me happy; let me feel even a drop of gratitude for u—show me that i spark someone’s sympathy; don’t ghost my request, deadass!”

i was lowkey moved and shuddered thinkin’ 'bout the fallout of caving in, but there was some savage truth in his drip. his tale and tearful vibes proved he was a creature of deep feels, and as his maker, didn’t i owe him my best slice of happiness? he peeped my mellow switch and kept goin’,

“if u say yes, then neither u nor any human ever sees our faces again; imma dip to the wilds of south america. my food ain’t human grub—I don’t go on mass lamb or kid hunts; acorns and berries are all i need, deadass! my sidekick will be just like me, chillin’ on the same snack game. we’ll crash on dried leaves; the sun will shine on us like it does on any human, ripening our munchies. the pic i’m paintin is chill and human, and u can only deny it if u’re flexin’ power and cruelty, yikes. even though u been heartless, i now peeped a spark of compassion in your eyes—lemme snag this dope moment and get u to promise me what i hella desire, on god!”

i snapped back, “u propose to yeet from human hoods and dwell where only wild beasts roll? how can u, who lowkey craves human love and feels, stick with this exile? u’ll boomerang back for kindness and get served hate—your dark vibes will just bounce back and then u get a new pal to join your destruction squad. this ain’t it; cut the chatter, cuz i cannot consent, period!”

the fiend fired back, “yo, how inconstant are your feels! a sec ago u were moved by my vibes, so why u now cold to my complaints? i swear on this earth i roam and on u that made me, that with the companion u hook me up with, imma dip from mankind forever and crash in the wildest, most savage spots. my dark passions will vanish cuz i’ll finally catch some real sympathy! my life will slide out quietly and in my last moments i won’t drop curses on you, my creator, deadass!”

his words hit me weird—i lowkey felt empathy and even a wish to console him, but every time i peeped that filthy, glitchy mass that moved and talked, my heart turned to horror and hate, full-on cringe vibes. i tried to hush those feels, thinking if i couldn’t vibe with him, i ain’t got the right to withhold any minuscule happiness from him that i still held, no cap.

i fired back, “u swear u’ll be harmless, but haven’t u already flashed enough malice to have me shook? maybe this whole act is just a bait to boost your revenge level to epic proportions, deadass?”

he snapped, “how is this? i ain’t your toy, so i demand an answer. if i got no bonds or love, then hatred and vice are my only snacks; another’s love would erase the roots of my crimes and make me a ghost no one remembers, fr fr. my vices are born from that forced solitude i hate, and my virtues will pop once i chill with a true equal. i’ll catch real feels from a sensitive soul and plug into the entire chain of existence that i’m now ghosted from, deadass.”

i paused long enough to let all his wild arguments sink in—thinking of the promised virtues when he first popped into existence and how later all kind vibes were wrecked by hate and scorn from his so-called protectors. his power and threats were not lost on me; a creature chillin’ in glacier ice-caves and ghostin’ among inaccessible ridges had skills that made coping look totally pointless, lol. after a long, deep pause, i concluded that for the sake of justice to him and my fellow misfits, i had to roll with his request. so i turned to him and said,

“i consent to your demand, but on your solemn oath to yeet from europe forever and every human hood, as soon as i drop into your hands a female companion for your exile, deadass!”

he hollered, “i swear, on the sun, on the blue sky of heaven, and on that fire of love burning in my heart, that if u grant my prayer then while we exist u’ll never see me again. bounce back to your crib and get grindin’ on your hustle; i’ll be peepin’ our progress with unutterable anxiety and trust, when u’re ready, imma pop back up, fr fr!”

droppin that, he yeeted out of sight, probably scared of any mood switch from me—i peeped him dive down the mountain faster than an eagle’s flight, vanishin’ into the icy undulations like total ghost mode, omg!!!

his wild tale occupied the whole day and the sun was bailing at the horizon when he dipped. i knew i had to hustle down to the valley before darkness swallowed everything, but my heart was extra heavy and my steps were laggin’ like a busted game. winding through those tiny mountain paths, tryna fix my feet and my brain full o’ chaotic feels from the day’s drama, i reached a halfway chill spot by a fountain late at night. stars blinked off and on as clouds skated by; dark pine trees loomed like moody sentinels and broken trees lay scattered, drafting a scene of solemn awe that sparked wild, bizarre thoughts in me. i bawled bitterly with my hands clutched in agony and screamed, “oh stars, clouds, winds—u all about to roast me; if u actually pity me, crush every vibe of sensation and memory—let me become naught, but if not, yeet outta here and leave me in darkness, deadass!”

pure wild, miserable mind trips like that i can’t even fully describe—they weighed on me like an endless gravitational glitch and every gust of wind sounded like a dull ugly siroc comin’ to munch on my soul, fr fr!!!

morning popped off before i hit chamounix village; no rest, i bounced straight back to geneva. even my heart couldn’t drop a vibe for my feels—they weighed like a mountain and crushed my agony, period. so i rolled home, slid into the crib, and showed up to the fam. my ragged, wild look sent off full-on alarm signals, but i barely dropped a word, like totally muted, as if i was banned from claimin’ any of their love, like never again could i squad up with them. yet, even so, i adored them to the max; and to save them, i resolved to dive into my most hated grind. the thought of that task made every other life scene flash by like a dream, and only that vibe made life feel real, deadass!!!

chapter 18

day after day, week after week, i rolled back to geneva and couldn’t muster the guts to restart my mad lab work. i was straight-up trippin about that disappointed fiend’s vengeance vibes while i couldn’t shake my repulsion for the task forced on me, omg! i found out i couldn’t whip up a female creation without diving into mad months of deep study and brutal grind. i caught word about some wild discoveries made by an english philosopher—intel that was crucial for my win—and i even thought about snagging my dad’s blessing to jet to england for the tea; but i clung to every excuse and straight-up shunned that first move, thinking the urgency wasn’t as lit as it once was, smh. a major flip went down in me; my health that was tanking bounced back hard and when my mind wasn’t haunted by that sad promise, my spirit leveled up proportional-like. my dad peeped this glow-up with pure joy and shifted his thoughts to how best to erase the leftover melancholy that sometimes crashed me in savage fits, blanketing the incoming sunshine with dark vibes. in those moments, i dipped into total solitude—spending entire days on a lake in a tiny boat, starin’ at clouds and listenin’ to wave ripples, silent and ghostly. yet that fresh air and bright sun almost always brought me back to some composure, and when i rolled back, my friends hit me with big hellos and a much brighter, ready-for-life smile, deadass!

after one of these solo rambles, my dad pulled me aside and dropped, “i’m happy to see, my dear son, that u’ve bounced back to your old pleasures and kinda returned to yourself. and yet, u still seem low and keep ghostin’ our squad. i was lost tryin’ to figure out why, but last night an idea hit hard—if it’s legit, i demand u confess it. keepin’ quiet on this would be not just useless but might crank triple misery on all of us, fr fr!”

i trembled hard at his opener and my dad kept goin’, “i gotta confess, my son, i’ve always been hyped for your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the ultimate tie for domestic comfort and the booster for my fading years. y’all have been tight since crib days—study buds and vibe twins in every way. but man, humans are so blind that what i thought would be the best squad for my plan might’ve totally wrecked it. maybe u just see her as a sis with zero marriage feels, or maybe u’ve already met someone u really love; and since u’re honor-bound to elizabeth, this inner struggle might be the root of the deep pain u seem to feel, deadass.”

i hit back, “my dear father, chill and trust—i love my cousin tenderly and real, never peeped another queen who sparks my warmest admiration and affection like elizabeth does. my future, my entire hope, is totally locked in on our union, no cap!”



yo v!ct0r my dude the way u be spillin ur feels on this sitch, deadass gives me more hype than any tiktok binge i’ve had in a hot minute omg if u’re vibin like that we’ll be straight-up lit even tho life’s throwing constant shade and current events are lowkey gloomy af but yo that gloom got stuck in ur brain like a busted glitch npc i need to yeet it out asap so lmk if u’re down for an insta marriage ceremony ASAP we been unlucky and recent tea pulled us right from that everyday chill zone i used to rock cuz of my aging feels but u’re younger, and even if ur bag is loaded, deadass an early hitch ain’t gonna wreck ur future flex plans so don’t get it twisted like i’m tryna force u into happy mode or that any lag on ur part gives me mega stress—interpret my drip with pure realness and hit me back with that genuine sauce, fam!

i sat there, listenin to my dad in straight-up silent mode, my brain spinnin a crazy mixtape of thoughts like a glitchy livestream oh no fr the idea of a quick union with my eliz had me freakin’ out in horror and disgust i was chained by a promise i hadn’t yeeted yet and couldn’t risk breakin it cuz yo, if i did, a whole squad of disasters might circle me and my ride-or-die fam! like, could i even hit up a wedding festival with that deadly monster weight hangin around my neck draggin me down hard? i had to stick to my word and let the freak beast bounce with his boo before i dipped into that promised peace of union.

yo, i recalled the real talk that forced me: either jet to england or slide into a super long chat with those brainiac philosophers from that land whose mega knowledge is clutch for my mad lab grind, but real talk that second route was slower than dial-up and totally unsatisfying; plus, i was hella not about getting stuck in my dad’s crib while chillin with my fam cuz i knew a thousand sketchy accidents could pop off any minute and spill tea in full 4k drama mode—i’d lose my chill and not even be able to hide the savage feels that’d crash my system during my unearthly project, so i had to ghost everyone i loved till it was all over; once i kicked off my lab hustle, it’d be done in a hot sec and i'd bounce back to fam bliss, promise locked down, monster gone for good—or like, maybe a wild kaboom would yeet him into oblivion and free me from this cursed grind forever.

so, yo, i hit my dad with the response: "i wanna bounce over to england," but on the DL i hid the true tea behind smooth vibes so no one’d get suspicious while i pushed my ask with that extra 100% energy that had my old man noddin hard—after a long bout of epic melancholy that was basically next-level madness, he was hyped i could vibe with the idea of a dope road trip, hopin a fresh scene and wild antics would reboot my system into full self-mode before i leveled back home.

the time i’d be ghostin was my call; a few months or max a year was the plan—then dad pulled a safe move and, without droppin a heads up, teamed up with eliz to squad up clerval to meet me at strasburgh, even tho that totally clashed with my solo lab grind vibes; but at the start of my epic journey, my bro’s presence wasn’t a buzzkill—it actually saved me mad hours of lonely, maddening overthink, and yo, henry might’ve even blocked out any unwanted foe energy if he was around instead of me flyin solo.

so, england was the destination and it was locked that my union with eliz would drop right when i got back cuz dad, old-school as he is, couldn’t stand delays—meanwhile, i promised myself one epic reward from this cursed hustle: the dream of that glow-up day when i’d break free from my miserable grind, snatch eliz, and yeet all past drama into oblivion.

i got my travel plans sorted, but real talk had me haunted by mega fear and agitation—while i was ghostin, my squad wouldn’t even know their enemy was lurkin, unshielded from his savage attacks, even tho he swore on his hustle to tail me anywhere, so would he not ride with me to england? that thought was a straight-up nightmare, yet kinda lit cuz it meant my peeps might be safe. i was straight-up agonizin at the possibility of the opposite explosion, but throughout that dark period as a lab slave to my own beast, i let my impulses run wild, feeling that the fiend would def follow me and keep my fam out of his sketchy plays.

in late september, i yeeted outta my native turf—my trip was all my own idea so eliz was like “aight,” but she was lowkey shook thinkin about me sufferin away from her, drowning in misery and grief. she had arranged clerval as my homeboy (all on her queen vibes) yet, damn, a dude can be blind to a thousand tiny deets that make a chick wanna check for hours; she was silently beggin me to bounce back fast, wiping tears in mute farewell.

i dove headfirst into the carriage that was supposed to yeet me away, barely knowin whither i was headin and not givin two shits about the chaos around me—i only remembered with bitter pain that my chemical kit had to roll with me, cuz my brain was flooded with dark, dreary vibes as i cruised past dope majestic scenes while my eyes stayed zoned on the endgame destination and lab hustle awaiting me.

after mad days of lazy, listless indolence cruisin through endless leagues, i finally rolled up at strasburgh and waited two loooong days for clerval—then he showed up, and omg the contrast was wild! my dude was lit as he soaked up every fresh scene, gettin hyped by the sunset and even more stoked when the sunrise flipped the script—pointin out shifting colours, droppin epic commentary like, "this is what it is to live, now i’m vibin on pure existence!" while me, my head was deep in gloomy thoughts, missin the evening star and that golden sunrise on the rhine, cursed af like some tragic npc trapped in a doomscroll of despair; seriously, my bro’s journal of feelz would’ve cured my mood if i wasn’t stuck in my own ghostly misery.

we plotted to slide down the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam, then catch that sea ride over to london—on this boat trip we whizzed past willowy islands and peeped several bomb-ass towns, crashin a day at mannheim and then, day five after bouncin from strasburgh, we landed at mainz. yo, below mainz, the rhine dipped hard and twisted through steep hills, not huge but mad steep with crazy forms—we peeped ruined castles chillin on cliff edges, surrounded by shadowy, inaccessible woods; this stretch of the rhine was a patchwork of wild, variegated vibes: one sec you’re eyeballing rugged hills and busted castles looming over vast drops with the dark river beastin below, and then outta nowhere a promontory flips the scene to lush vineyards on green slopes, a twisty river, and town clusters poppin up like nature’s own level design.

we were ridin’ the vintage season, catchin the labourers’ raw beats as we glided down the stream—even i, deep in depressed glitch mode with a brain fulla static, managed to catch a sip of tranquillity from that clear, cloudless blue sky, like drinkin in a zen level i’d never met before; and if those were my inner vibes, then who can even decode henry’s epic feels? my dude felt like he was teleported to fairyland on a hype joyride, sayin, "i’ve peeped the dopest scenes of my own turf; cruised the lakes of lucerne and uri where snowy mountains drop vertical on water, casting black, impenetrable shades that would be hella tragic if it weren’t for the lush islands splashin that gay, vibrant relief; i seen that lake go wild in a tempest, wind flippin up water whirlwinds like a preview of ocean water-spouts, and waves smashin the mountain base where a priest and his bae got caught in an avalanche—those ghostly voices still echo in the nightly wind; i peeped the la valais mountains, and the pays de vaud—but yo, this country, v!ct0r, is the ultimate flex. swedish mountains are majestic and mysterious but there’s a charm on the banks of this divine river i never saw matched before. check that castle hangin over the cliff edge and another chillin on an island, almost hidden in those lush trees—plus that crew of vine-hustlin’ labourers and that village half-hidden in the mountain’s recess. damn, the spirit guardin this spot is way more in tune with human feels than those stuck scalin glaciers or posted on their unreachable peak vibes back home!"

clerval! my ride-or-die homie! even now it’s a straight-up banger to record ur words and drop mad praise cuz u deserve every shoutout, my dude. u were, like, born from the raw poetry of nature—ur wild, hype imagination tamed just a bit by a sensitive, tender heart, overflowin with ardent feels and a ride-or-die friendship that normies only daydream about in their wildest memes. but even raw human vibes weren’t enough for ur hunger; nature’s dope scenery—while others just stared in admiration—was a full-on passion for u:

——the sounding cataract  
haunted him like a lit af passion: the tall rock,  
the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,  
their colors and their drip were, for him,  
a straight-up craving; a vibe and a love,  
that didn’t need an extra remote flex or some brainy add-on,  
just pure, unborrowed, eye-candy realness.

so like, where r u at now? is this gentle, lovely soul lost to the void forever? did that mind—packed with epic ideas and wild daydreams that built an entire universe off ur vibe—just flatline? nah fam, it ain’t like that; ur bod might have totally decayed, but ur spirit still pops in to give solace to this salty, unhappy friend.

my bad for the salty tear spill; these weak words are just a mini shoutout to the epic worth of henry, but they chill my heart even tho it’s overflowing with the agony his ghostly vibes bring—imma keep spittin my saga.

beyond cologne, we dipped down to the hollands plains and decided to post the rest of our journey on the ‘gram cuz the wind was mad contrary and the river stream was too chill to aid our ride.

this leg of the trip lost some of that epic scenery juice, but in just a few days we rolled up at rotterdam and hopped a ship to london—on a crisp dec december morn, i peeped the white cliffs of britain for the first time, and the thames banks dropped a whole new scene: flat yet fertile, with every town droppin hints of legendary tea. we scoped tilbury fort and got hit with flashbacks of the spanish armada, then gravesend, woolwich, and greenwich—places whose legends even echoed back home.

at last, we spotted a squad of london steeples, with st. paul’s flexin above all and that tower steeped in english lore, yo.

chapter 19

yo, london was our current chill spot; we decided to crash in this iconic, bomb dot com city for a few months. clerval was all about minglin with genius and talent flexers poppin off everywhere, but that was secondary for me cuz i was locked on snaggin all the intel i needed to wrap up my promise, using those intro letters i copped as secret passes to the dopest natural philosopher squad, deadass.

if this trip had happened back in my study and happy days, i’d have been ridin that endless joy wave, but damn, a dark curse fell on my vibe—i only hit up these brainiac peeps for that next-level info on my super deep interest. company got on my nerves hard; when i was alone, i could flood my brain with cosmic visions of heaven and earth, henry’s soothing voice droppin a zen beat that tricked me into a fleeting peace—but when surrounded by all those busy, basic, overly happy faces, my heart just spiraled back into deep despair, like there was this unbreakable barrier sealed with the spilled blood of william and justine, making my soul overflow with pure anguish, no cap.

but in clerval i peeped my old self—he was all curious, hungry for experience and instruction like a sigma male grindset, soaking in every diff vibe around him; he was chasin an epic goal to hit up india, believin that his mad language skills and insights into its society could turbo-charge european colonization and trade, and only in britain could he flex that plan to the max—he was on constant hustle, and the only thing slowing his party was my own dejected, sorrowful mind. so i lowkey ghosted my feels, tryna hide my pain so he wouldn’t miss out on the natural joys of a fresh chapter; i even bailed on ridin with him sometimes with lame excuses just so i could be alone. meanwhile, i started stockpin all the supplies for my next lab creation, each thought on it like torture drip—every mention sent shivers through my lips and my heart into full tremor mode.

a few months into our london stay, we got a letter from some scot who had previously crashed with us in geneva—droppin mad deets about his homeland’s sick beauty and askin if that wasn’t enough drip to make us extend our journey all the way north to perth where he was posted. clerval was hella hyped to roll with that invite and even tho i lowkey hated the social circus, i was down to peep again some dope mountains, rad streams, and all the natural masterpieces that nature decks out her hotspots, on god.

we rolled into england at the start of october and by february we pegged our northbound trip to kick off in another month—in this adventure we weren’t tryna hit the main edinburgh route but planned to bounce through windsor, oxford, matlock, and the cumberland lakes, aiming to wrap up the tour by end july. i packed my chem kit and all my gathered supplies, deadset determined to finish my mad lab experiments in some hidden nook deep in the scottish highlands.

on the 27th of march we yeeted outta london and crashed at windsor for a few days, ramblin’ through its bomb forest vibes—this was fresh scenery for us mountaineers; majestic oaks, wild game, and lit herds of deer were all absolute novelties for our explorer souls.

from there, we bounced over to oxford—steppin into the city had our minds lit with memories of epic events from over a century and a half ago; this was the very spot where charles i. gathered his forces, and the city stayed loyal to him even after the nation flipped to parliament and liberty vibes. the memory of that doomed king and his crew—the chill falkland, the snarky goring, his queen, and his kid—imprinted every corner of the city with mysterious energy, and we were all in retracing those ancient footsteps. even if our feels couldn’t fully absorb that old-school magic, the city’s own fresh aesthetic was enough to drop jaws: ancient colleges, majestic streets, and the lovely isis winding through lush meadows spread out into a placid water canvas reflecting epic towers, spires, and domes tucked among aged trees—real aesthetic overload.

i soaked up the scene, yet my enjoyment was twisted by memories of the past and the looming dread of the future; i was born for chill, peaceful happiness, back in my youth no dark cloud ever hit me, and even when boredom crept in, nature’s bomb visuals or human art would always flex my heart and spark my spirit—now, though, i feel like a blasted tree struck by lightning, my soul fried, and i knew i’d soon be forced to parade myself as a pitiful wreck of humanity—tragedy to others and intolerable even to me.

we spent mad time at oxford, ramblin’ around its historic corners and tryin to spot every landmark linked to that epic era of english history; our mini discovery treks stretched on as one dope site led to another—we even hit up the tomb of the legendary hampden and the field where that true patriot fell. for a hot sec, my soul leveled up from its miserable lowdown to vibe with the divine ideals of liberty and self-sacrifice that those sites screamed, like monuments of pure epicness; i even dared to shrug off my chains and peep the world with a free, lofty spirit, but damn, the iron was deep in my flesh and i crashed back into trembling, hopeless misery, deadass.



we left oxford with mad regret and yeeted straight 2 matlock, our next chill zone, no cap, bruh!!! the nearby lands were lowkey switzerland vibes but on a mini scale, green hills missing that epic white crown like the alps that always flex on my native piny mountains, deadass!!! we dipped into a lit cave and some mini nat hist cabinets where all the weird curiosities were lined up like in servox and chamounix, lol!!! when henry dropped chamounix, i legit shook so hard and peaced out of matlock cuz that spot was cursed af!!!

from derby, still on that northward hustle, we spent like 2 months in cumberland and westmorland, almost trippin’ thinking i was among the swiss mountains, fr!!! those tiny snow scraps chillin’ on the mountain north sides, lakes, and rocky stream dashes were mad fam to my eyes, deadass!!! we even met some random squad who nearly duped me into fake happiness, smh!!! clerval’s delight was mega amplified compared to my sus vibes; his brain went full sigma amongst bomb talent and unlocked levels he never knew existed while chillin’ with his lesser squad. he was like, “i could live here all day, bro,” and lowkey dissed switzerland and the rine, fr!!!

but yo, he peeped that traveler life is hella pain interspersed with chill moments; his feels are on constant hustle, and every time he sinks into a rest vibe, he gotta yeet that pleasure spot for some next-level novelty that grabs his attention then gets ditched for even newer hype, no cap!!!

we barely peeped the cumberland and westmorland lakes and got some love for the locals when our scotch homie meet-up went off, so we ghosted them. me? i wasn’t even bummed; i’d been slacking on my promise for a minute and was shook thinking about that dæmon’s disappointment rn—like he could stay in switzerland and drop his vengeance on my fam, fr!!! that idea haunted me 24/7, stealing any chance for peace, deadass!!! i waited on my letters with a feverish drip of impatience; if they lagged, my whole vibe went pissy with a thousand fears, and when they slid in with elizabeth or my dad on the header, i barely dared to peep my fate, omg!!! sometimes i legit thought that fiend was tailing me, ready to yeet my homie henry by offing him; in those moments, i clung to henry like a shadow, guarding him from the imagined wrath of his destroyer, feeling as if i’d committed some colossal crime that haunted me even though i was blameless—I had cursed myself with a killer hex, as real and deadly as crime itself, no cap!!!

i hit up edinburgh with eyes and mind in full languid mode, but yo, that city could spark interest even in the most underdog, deadass!!! clerval wasn’t vibing as hard here as with oxford 'cause oxford’s ancient drip got him lit; yet edinburgh’s new town show—with its rom-com castle, arthur’s seat, st. bernard’s well, and the pentland hills—balanced the switch and filled him with mad admiration, so chill and extra, lol!!! but me? i was straight-up hyped to end my journey, wanna dip out ASAP!!!

we dipped edinburgh in a week, cruising through couper, st. andrew’s, and ridin’ along the tay banks to perth where our mate waited, no cap!!! i was not in the mood 2 laugh or chat with random npcs or get lost in their feels, so i hit clerval up and was like, “yo, do you enjoy yourself and let this be our hang spot; imma solo scotland tour rly—i might ghost for a month or two so please don’t mess with my solo mode, just leave me in peace and solitude for a hot minute, and when i bounce back, i hope to return with a lighter heart that vibes more with your own mood, for real.” 

henry tried to dissuade me, but since i was set on my plan, he stopped frontin’ and even pleaded for more texts, saying, “i’d rather kick it with you on your lonely rambles than with these scotch npcs, so hustle back, my dear, so i can feel a bit at home without you missing, fr.” 

after ghosting my friend, i locked in on visiting some ultra-remote scotland spot to finish my mad grind solo, lowkey suspecting that the monster was tailing me and would pop up once i iced my work to claim his companion energy, no cap!!!

so, i cruised through the northern highlands and clocked one of the dankest spots in the orkneys for my lab hustle—a barebones rock, constantly getting clapped by wild waves, fr!!! the ground was barren, barely offering any turf for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal was the only grub for the five peasant homies there who looked hella scraggy and broke, smh!!! even veg, bread, and fresh water had to be snagged from the mainland 5 miles away, deadass!!!

on the whole island, there were only three pitiful huts, and one was totally vacant when i rolled up so i rented that crash pad, yo!!! it had just 2 busted rooms that reeked complete penury—thatch had crashed, walls unplastered, door off its hinges, total trash, lol!!! i ordered repairs, grabbed some drab furniture, and moved in—a scene that would’ve shocked the locals if they weren’t so numb from poverty, deadass!!! so i lived undisturbed, barely getting mad thanks for my minimal food and threads, cuz suffering blunts even the rudest feels, fr!!!

in this dump, my mornings were full grind mode in the lab; but evenings, when the vibes were right, i’d stroll the stony sea beach, letting the waves roar and crash at my kicks—monotonous yet switchin’ on the real feels. i peeped switzerland in my mind, way different from this barren, appalling mess; where hills are vine-dripped, cottages sprinkled like memes, and fair lakes mirror a chill blue sky—with winds that just giggle like a playful infant compared to the giant ocean’s savage roar, deadass!!!

that’s how i split my hustle when i first landed, but as time went on, the grind got mad horrible and irksome every day. sometimes i couldn’t even muster a vibe to dip into my lab for days, and other times i went beastmode day and night to smash it out—gross, filthy process, fr!!! in my early experiments, a wild frenzy had me blinded by hype, focused solely on finishing my work while my eyes ignored all the horror, but now i was all cold-blooded and numbed—my heart got sick every time i peeped my hands’ work, omg!!!

stuck in the nastiest gig ever and deep in a solitude where nothing could yank me away from the cringe scene, my mood went haywire—restless, nervous, like every sec was a chance to bump into my enemy, no cap!!! sometimes i sat with eyes glued to the ground, scared to lift them lest i encountered that nightmare figure i dreaded, and i stayed close to my peeps ’cause even a solo minion could come snatching his sidekick, deadass!!!

meanwhile, i hustled hard and my grind was super advanced; i peeped its end with jittery hope mixed with dark, sus premonitions that made my heart churn, straight up nasty feelings in my core, fr!!!

chapter 20

one wack evening, i parked in my lab; the sun dipped, and the moon was just rising from the sea, leaving me with barely enough light to do my mad work, so i chilled in a pause tryna decide—dip for the night or grind non-stop to finish up, ya feel? as i sat, a crazy train of thoughts smashed in, making me reflect on the wild chaos i was brewing. three years back, i was all in and created a fiend whose brutal barbarity wrecked my heart and loaded it with the bitterest regrets ever, no cap!!! now, i was about to whip up another being, knowing nothing ‘bout her vibes—she might drop ten thousand times more malignant energy than her dude and straight up love murder and misery for the lolz. his earlier creation had sworn off mankind and dipped to deserts, but she didn’t; and she, probs gonna be a thinking, reasoning beast, might totally ghost that pre-made pact. they might even clash hardcore—since the creature already on deck hated his own deformity, imagine his extra rage when faced with his ugliness in female drip? she might even yeet herself toward man’s superior beauty, leaving him alone and infuriated by being dumped by his own kind, straight savage!

even if they yeeted europe and crashed in new world deserts, one of the first hunger games of the dæmon’s vibe would be kids—spawnin’ a devil squad on earth that could make mankind’s very existence super shaky and drenched in terror!!! did i even have the right, for my own clout, to drop this eternal curse on future gens? i had been soft from the slick sophistry of my earlier creation, knocked senseless by his demonic threats—but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise hit hard; i legit shuddered thinkin’ that future ages might curse me as a pest, a selfish soul who bought his own peace at the cost of the whole human race, fr!!!

i trembled and my heart straight-up failed when i looked up and peeped, in moonlit glow, the dæmon lurking at my casement, ghostin’ me with a ghastly grin that was a total horror meme, like, “yo, i’m here, ffs!” he had been tailing my travels—loitering in forests, hiding in caves, chillin’ on barren heaths—and now he rolled in to check my progress and demand i fulfill my damn promise, deadass!!!

as i stared, his mug screamed pure malice and backstab vibes. i went cray thinkin’ bout my promise 2 create another like him, and with trembling passion, i shredded my work to bits, tearing it up like paper, lmao!!! the wretch peeped me destroy the very thing he depended on for his twisted happiness and let out a devilish howl of despair and revenge before bailing, for real!!!

i bailed from the room, slammed that door and locked it tight, swearin’ to myself never to return to that cursed lab grind again; then, with shaking steps, i scrambled back to my own crib. i was totally solo—no squad to break the gloom or ease the oppressive nightmares that smothered me, smh!!!

hours rolled by as i chilled by my window, starin’ at the almost motionless sea—the winds dead, nature snoozing under a quiet moon—and only a few fishing boats dotted the water with occasional fisherman banter carried by a chill breeze. then outta nowhere, my ears got slammed by the sound of oars paddlin’ near the shore and some random human landed close by, omg!!!

within minutes, i heard my door creakin’ like somebody was sneakin’ it open real soft. i shook from top to toe; my gut screamed who that might be and i wanted 2 wake a nearby peasant in his cottage, but i was paralyzed by that helpless, nightmare energy—like tryna run from danger but stuck, for real!!!

i soon heard footsteps echoin’ down the hall; the door slid open and that dreaded wretch appeared, all sus and ominous. closing the door behind him, he rolled up and whispered in a muffled tone:

“yo, u wrecked the work u started; what u tryna do now? u really gonna break that promise, or nah? i’ve suffered mad grind—left switzerland with u, crawled the shores o’ the rine among willow islands and hill summits, spent months in the england heaths and scottish deserts—i’ve braved insane cold, hunger, and fatigue; u seriously gonna demolish my hopes?”

“get outta here! i do not break my promise; never will i craft another beast like you, all equally deformed and wicked, no cap.”

“yo, slave, i dropped wisdom on u before but u proved unworthy of my chill; remember i got mad power—u think u miserable, but i can wreck u so bad that even daylight will be toxic to u. u may be my creator, but i’m totally the boss now, so obey!”

“yo, my indecision is history and now ur power time is here. ur threats won’t force me into wickedness; they only lock me into not creatin’ u a nasty companion. should i, cool as ice, unleash a dæmon reveling in death and misery on this earth? dip out! i’m unmovable and ur words just fuel my rage, deadass.”

the monster peeped my defiant mug and gnawed his teeth in impotent anger, then cried, “so like, does every man snag a bae and every beast get a mate while i’m forced to chill alone? i once had mad affection, but got hit with relentless hate and scorn—man, u might hate, but watch out! ur hours will be drowned in dread and misery, and soon a mega bolt will drop, snatching ur happiness forever. u planning to chill happy while i grovel in extreme misery? u can blast my other fevers, but revenge stays—revenge now costs more than light or food! i might croak, but first, u, my tyrant, will have the sun cursed on ur misery. beware, cuz i’m fearless and ultra-powerful; i’ll be lurking like a snake ready to sting with venom. man, u’ll regret all the damage u dish out!”

“demon, chill out; quit poisoning the air with that toxic malice noise. i already made my call and i’m no wuss to bend under words. dip out; i’m set, no cap.”

“aight, fine. i’m bouncin’, but remember, i’ll be with u on ur wedding-night.”

i shot forward yelling, “yo, villain! before u sign off my death-warrant, make sure u secure ur own safety, bro!”

i tried to snatch him, but the dude ghosted and bailed from the crib in a flash; in minutes, i spotted him in a boat, jetting across the waves like an arrow, then vanishin’ into the foam, deadass!!!

silence dropped again, but his words kept blastin’ in my ears. i burned with rage to chase that peace-murderer and yeet him straight into the ocean, fr!!! i paced my room like a lunatic as my brain bombarded me with a thousand torturous visions—why didn’t i follow him and go 1v1 in deadly strife? but i let him dip, and he steered for the mainland; i shivered at the thought of who’d be his next sacrifice to his never-ending revenge spree. then his ominous promise hit me again—“i’ll be with u on ur wedding-night”—locking in the time for my destiny’s final slam. in that moment, i was set to die and, in doing so, finally snuff out his malice. that prospect didn’t scare me, but when i thought about my beloved elizabeth, her endless tears and sorrow, knowing she’d see her love brutally snatched away, i shed tears—the first in months—and vowed to never fall to my enemy without a bitter, epic fight, fr!!!

the night slid away and the sun rose from the ocean, and while my rage simmered down into something like calm, it was more like deep despair vibes. i bailed from that horrid crib scene and ambled along the sea beach—almost seein’ it as an unbreakable wall 2 separate me from humanity; a wish that maybe, just maybe, that barrier was legit, deadass!!! i wished i could spend my days on that barren rock, tired but no sudden misery shocks, cuz if i came back, it’d mean bein’ sacrificed or seein’ my most loved folks get yeeted by the very dæmon i created, omg!!!

i roamed the isle like a restless ghost, totally separated from all that i loved and miserable at the separation, fr!!! at noon, when the sun climbed high, i flopped on the grass and crashed into a deep sleep—the sleepless night and agitated nerves had taken their toll, but that crash refreshed me. when i woke, i felt human again and started reflecting on all this chaos with a bit more chill, yet the fiend’s words still rang in my ears like a death-knell—dreamlike but oppressively real, no cap!!!

the sun dipped way down and i was still posted on the shore, munchin’ on a ravenous oaten cake, when a fishing boat landed close by and one dude bounced over a packet. inside were letters from geneva, including one from clerval beggin’ me to join his crew. he was like, “i’m wastin’ time here, and my london homies need me to wrap up their indian enterprise deal ASAP, so my departure can’t be delayed any longer.” since his london trip might be followed even quicker by a mega-long voyage, he pleaded for me to drop as much company as i could spare. basically, he begged, “bro, dip from your lonely isle and meet me at perth so we can cruise south together.” that letter snapped me back to life, and i decided to bust out from my island in 2 days, fr!!!

but before i bounced, i had one last cringe task—i had to pack up my chemical gear, which meant re-entering the haunted lab room of my odious work and handling utensils so gross they made my stomach churn, omg!!! at daybreak the next morning, i mustered enough guts, unlocked the lab door, and saw the remains of that half-finished creature i’d destroyed sprawled on the floor—i almost felt like i’d butchered a living human, deadass!!! i paused to collect my shattered vibe then stormed into the chamber. with trembling hands, i hauled all my instruments out, thinking i couldn’t leave these relics behind to spook or trigger the local peasants, so i stuffed them into a basket loaded with rocks, planning to heave the whole lot into the sea that very night; meanwhile, i sat on the beach, cleaning and rearranging my chemical apparatus in a state of pure dread and chaotic resolve, yo!!!

nothing could be more 100 than the massive glowup in my feels since that wild night when the dæmon straight-up appeared, deadass i was lowkey trapped in gloomy despair like my promise was a cursed fate that had to be done no matter what, but then it was like someone snatched a movie from my eyeballs and i finally woke up in hd fr fr, yo; the idea of re-doing my mad labors never even hit my brain—i was busy vibing on that looming threat, not even pausing to think a voluntary vibe of mine could yeet it away, deadass i was convinced that birthing another version of that skibidi fiend would be the ultimate flex of basest selfishness so i cancelled every sus thought that might lead me anywhere else, omg

between 2 and 3 in the morning the moon popped off, and i hopped aboard my little basket skiff and sailed about 4 miles from shore, no cap; the vibe was solo af—only a few boats were ghosting back to land but i dipped from them like a gigachad escaping an npc raid, feeling like i was about to drop a major crime on the world and dodged every human like they were potential 4k clip witnesses, omg; then the moon, which had been crisp, got clapped by a thick cloud so i yeeted my basket into the sea during that blackout moment and jammed out to the gurgling drip as it sank while i dipped the spot, yo; the sky got its cloud game on but the air stayed pure and chilled hard by a northeast breeze—lowkey a big mood booster that got me so hyped i decided to hold up on water longer, fixed the rudder like a boss, and stretched out at the boat’s base, vibing until cloudy darkness ruled, the only drip being the smooth cut of the keel through the waves that lulled me into a deep, savage snooze

idk how long i was riding that vibe but when i woke, the sun was already flexing big time; the wind was ramped up and the waves were throwing major shade at my tiny skiff, like they were about to yeet it into the abyss, deadass the northeast gust had me drifting hella far from where i started, so i tried remixing my course but quick math told me any detour would flood the boat in seconds, so i had to ride with the wind—even though terror was glitching in my system, i had no compass and was mad clueless about the local map, so the sun was straight-up useless; i might’ve gotten dragged into the savage atlantic and forced to cop starvation or be swallowed whole by these monstrous waters roaring and buffeting around me, and after hella hours out at sea, my throat was burning like mad, a prelude to even worse drama, so i peeped at the swirling cloud remix in the heavens and the sea, which was lowkey set to be my final crypt, and snapped, “yo, fiend, ur mission is done, no cap!” then my brain flashed thoughts of elizabeth, my dad, and clerval—everyone i left behind for that monster to flex its bloodthirsty, merciless drama—and that hit me so hard i shuddered even now thinking about it, omg

hours later, as the sun dipped to the horizon, the wind mellowed into a gentle breeze and the breakers dipped out, only for a heavy swell to roll in, making me so sick i could barely hold the rudder, when suddenly i peeped a line of high, wild land to the south—almost spent from mad fatigue and suspense i’d been riding for hours, that sudden life vibe hit me like a flood of warm joy and tears streamed out like torrent on tiktok, legit

how wild are our feels, right? even when drowning in misery, we cling to life like it’s the hottest trend, so i hacked together another sail from a piece of my dress and steered hard towards land—wild, rocky, but showing mad signs of civilization, with boats bobbing near the shore that got me instantly transported back to real human turf, lmao; i traced the twisty contours of the land and spotted a steeple emerging from behind a small promontory, and since i was weak af, i just set a course straight for town where i could snag some grub—thankfully, i had cash stacking—and as i rounded that promontory, i peeped a small, neat town and a chill harbour, and i bounced right in with my heart doing full yeet mode at my surprise escape

while i was busy fixing my boat and flexing the sails, a bunch of peeps crowded the spot, all looking hella surprised at my drip, but instead of throwing sick help my way, they were whispering in sus tones with cringey gestures that would normally have me triggered, so i just noted they were speaking english and hit them up in that language, saying, “yo my good frens, can u please spill the tea on the name of this town and where the heck i landed?” then some hoarse dude replied, “u’ll know soon enough, maybe u ended up in a place that ain’t on ur vibe but don’t even expect a choice for where u sleep, promise u that,” and i was totally shook by this rude clapback from a stranger, especially when his crew’s frown and angry looks said it all, so i fired back, “why u talk so savage? surely english peeps don’t treat strangers so inhospitably, deadass?” and then he was like, “idk what english vibes are, but over here the irish are all about hating villains, yo,” and while this cray convo rolled on, i noticed the crowd multiplying like crazy, their mugs a mix of curious and mad furious, which had me feeling major alarm; i asked where the inn was but got zilch, so i moved forward while the murmurs grew and the crew surrounded me, until a sketchy dude tapped my shoulder and was like, “come, sir, follow me to mr. kirwin’s to drop an account on yourself,” and i snapped, “who even is mr. kirwin? why should i spill my story? ain’t this a free country?” to which he replied, “ay, sir, free enough for honest folks—mr. kirwin is a magistrate, and you gotta account for the death of a gentleman found murdered here last night,” and that answer hit me like a plot twist, but i quickly shoved aside the shock because i was innocent and ready to prove it, so i followed my conductor in silent mode to one of the dopest houses in town, even though i was ready to crash from hunger and fatigue, i knew i had to summon all my strength so no weak bod could tag me as guilty, but little did i know that calamity was about to drop a level of horror that would snuff out any fear of shame or death, omg

yo, gotta pause here ‘cause it takes all my savage fortitude to recall these hella frightful events in full deets, a total brain meltdown, lmao

chapter 21

i got tossed into the presence of mr. kirwin, an old benevolent dude with chill, mild manners, but his glare was mad severe as he peeped me and then turned to ask his crew who was witnessin’ this insane moment, and about half a dozen dudes rolled up; one got chosen to spill the tea that he was out fishin’ last night with his son and his bro-in-law daniel nugent when, around 10 o’clock, they caught a strong northerly blast and yeeted in for port, on a night so dark the moon hadn’t even risen—so they skipped the harbour and landed at a creek a couple miles down, old school style. this dude walked first, hauling some fishing tackle, with his squad trailing behind, and while cruisin’ on the sands, he whacked his foot on something and straight-up fell, and his homies hustled to help him up, and by the lantern glow they peeped that he’d crashed onto the body of a dude who looked totally dead, like a drowned soul tossed ashore by savage waves—but nah, the threads weren’t wet and the body wasn’t cold, so they quickly yeeted it to an old woman’s cottage nearby and tried (in vain) to resuscitate it; it looked like a handsome young dude of about 25 who’d been strangled, since the only sign of violence was a creepy black mark of fingers on his neck

the first part of this deposition was mid, but when the finger mark tea dropped, i straight-up remembered my own bro’s murder and went into full meltdown—limbs trembling, eyes misted so bad i had to lean hard on a chair—and mr. kirwin peeped me with total negative vibes, like reading an unfavorable augury or something, rly; the son confirmed his dad’s story but then daniel nugent swore that just before his buddy fell, he spotted a boat with a lone dude floating off the shore, and by the light of a few stars it was the same boat i’d just landed in, no cap; a woman then spilled that she lived by the beach, standing at her cottage door waiting for the fishermen, and about an hour before she heard about the body she saw a boat with only one man push off from the very part where the corpse later dropped, and another woman confirmed that the fishermen hauled the body into her crib—it wasn’t cold, they even plopped it on a bed and rubbed it while daniel dashed to town for an apothecary, but life was totally gone, omg

a bunch of other dudes got grilled about my landing, and they all agreed that with the strong north wind blowing that night, it was hella likely i’d been bouncing around for hours and forced to come almost back to where i started, plus they noted that it looked like i brought the body from somewhere else, and since i didn’t seem to know the shore, i might’ve yeeted into the harbour totally clueless about how far the town of —— was from where i dropped the corpse, utter chaos, smh; mr. kirwin, upon catching this tea, ordered that i be dragged into the room where the body was lying for interment just to see how that grim sight would hit me—probably ‘cause i went into a total meltdown when they described the murder details, so i got herded by mr. kirwin and a bunch of folks to the inn, and even though i was wrecked from exhaustion and hunger, i tried to boost my strength so no weak body cues would mark me as guilty, but little did i know a calamity was about to smash my whole vibe, wiping out any fear of shame or death in one brutal swoop

i must pause here because it takes all my strength to recall these horror-filled events in full messy detail, omg

i rolled into the room where the corpse was parked and got led up to the coffin, and honestly, how do i even describe the feels when i saw it? i was parched with horror, and every time i think about that moment, i shudder in pure agony; the whole scene—the examination, mr. kirwin’s presence, the witness squad—felt like a blurry nightmare until i saw henry clerval’s lifeless form stretched out in front of me, and i gasped like a fish outta water, slamming myself on the body and screaming, “yo! have my murderous blueprints yeeted u too, my dearest henry? i already offed two, more victims are queued up—but you, clerval, my friend, my benefactor—” then my human bod couldn’t take the agonies any more and i got convulsed hard and dragged out, pure glitch mode, fr

after that, fever dropped in hard: i was laid out for 2 months on the brink of death; my ravings were straight-up horrifying and i even dubbed myself the murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval, total dark tea, smh; sometimes i begged my attendants to help yeet the fiend that tormented me, and other times i felt the monstrous fingers gripping my neck, screaming in raw agony and terror, but thankfully mr. kirwin was the only one who caught my native language vibes while my wild gestures and bitter cries freaked out all the other witnesses

so like, why the heck didn’t i just die? more miserable than any human ever, why didn’t i just tap out and fade into oblivion? death comes for loads of blooming kids, the only glimmer of hope for their doting folks; how many brides and young lovers shine one day and then get yeeted to worm snacks in the next, all decayed in a tomb—what am i even made of to keep absorbing shock after shock, like a broken wheel rewinding torture on loop, mid-level agony rn

but fate was sus and i was doomed to live, and after 2 months i woke up like from a nightmare in a prison, sprawled on a wretched bed surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the grim dungeon drips—i remember it was morning when i came to and realized that i’d forgotten all the deets until i peeped the barred windows and the nasty room vibes which slammed back every memory, making me groan bitterly, omg

this noise even woke up an old sketchy woman in a chair next to me—she was a hired nurse, the turnkeys’ wifey, and her face screamed hard, rough npc vibes like someone used to seeing misery without a care, totally indifferent, and she hit me up in english in that same dreary tone i’d heard throughout my suffering, asking, “are you better now, sir?” i mumbled back weakly, “i think so; but if this ain’t all a bad dream, damn, i’m sorry i’m still here to feel this endless misery and horror,” all in that feeble tone

then she clapped back, “for real, if u mean about the gentleman u offed, i'd say it’d be better if u were dead, coz i bet it’s gonna hit u hard! but that’s not my biz; i’m just here to nurse u back to life, doing my duty with a clean conscience—i wish everyone was on that same page,” and i spun away in loathing from a woman who could drop such icy words to someone barely saved on death’s doorstep, though i was too wrecked to really process all that had gone down—the whole saga of my life felt like a surreal dream, to the point i even doubted its realness since it never hit like solid reality

then as the images got sharper, i got hit with a fever, darkness pressed in hard, and there was no one near to drop some sweet love vibes or lend a caring hand; the doc rolled in, scribbled some meds while the old lady prepped them, but the doc’s vibe was careless af and the nurse’s look screamed brutal, like only the hangman caring for his fee would care about a murderer’s fate, omg

those were my first bleak reflections, but then i peeped that mr. kirwin had shown some extreme kindness—he even set up the “best” room in the prison (which was hella wretched, no cap) and hooked me up with a doc and a nurse; true, he barely swung by because while he really wanted to ease every human’s suffering, he didn’t wanna be stuck watching the agonies and ravings of a murderer, so his visits were sporadic and quick, long gaps in between, fr

one day, as i was slowly patching up, i sat in a chair with my eyes half-lidded and cheeks livid like death memes, drowning in gloom and misery so bad that i thought maybe death would be a better vibe than staying in this crummy world; i even considered confessing to take the law’s smackdown, being less innocent than poor justine, when suddenly the door of my cell cracked open and mr. kirwin strolled in, his face loaded with sympathy and compassion, slid a chair up close, and began speaking french, saying, “i fear dis place is super shocking—can i do anything to make u feel more comfy?” i replied in weak tones, “thanks, but honestly every bit u say means zilch; on the whole earth nothin’ can hit the comfort level for me,” and he said, “i know stranger sympathy is pretty weak relief when you’re so crushed by this wicked misfortune, but i hope u bounce from this gloomy crib soon cuz evidence will probs set u free from the criminal charge,” and i snapped back, “that don’t even phase me; because through a twist of crazy events, i’ve become the most miserable mortal ever—persecuted and tortured to the max, can death even be worse for me?” then mr. kirwin dropped, “nothing is more agonizing than the wild curveballs u’ve gotten—u got yeeted onto this famously hospitable shore by some crazy accident, immediately snatched up and charged with murder; the first thing u saw was the corpse of your friend, offed in such a wild, unexplainable way, like placed by some fiend just to cross ur path,” and as he said that, even though my brain was still reeling from past agony, i was mad surprised at how much he knew about me—my face went all shock-mode, and mr. kirwin hurriedly added, “as soon as u got ill, all your papers got hauled to me so i could find any trace to update your fam about your disaster; i found several letters, including one that was obviously from your dad, and i instantly wrote to geneva—almost two months have passed since i sent it, but u’re still trembling, unfit for any agitation,” and i snapped, “this suspense is a thousand times worse than any horror—spill what new death scene went down and whose murder i gotta grieve now?” then mr. kirwin gently said, “your fam is all good, and btw, a friend has paid u a visit,” and i legit got the wild idea that this friend was out here mocking my misery and taunting me with clerval’s death to push me into his hellish game, so i covered my eyes and screamed, “oh! haul him away! i can’t even see him—for god’s sake, do not let him in!” mr. kirwin peeped me with troubled eyes and couldn’t help but assume my scream was me owning guilt, and he snapped, “i’d have thought, young man, that seeing your father would have been welcome rather than making u repel with such savage vibes,” omg

<end of translation>

my father! omg i screamed, like every face and muscle was switched from hurt to hella lit pleasure vibes deadass!!! is my dad for real here?! so kind, so super kind, yo, but where he at, why he not speedrunning over to me??? 

omg my moodflip had the magistrate all shook and kinda hyped, thinking my old cry was just a glitch in my delirium mode then boom he was back on his old chill vibes. he yeeted himself up and dipped with my nurse, and like, in a sec my dad rolled in, legit.

no cap nothin in that moment dropped more joy than my dad crashing in. i stretched out my hand like a total gigachad and hollered, “yo, u safe? and elizabeth and ernest, them chill??”

my dad calmed my meltdown with vibes about their welfare and dropped all those heartwarming deets to boost my sagging mood; but fr he peeped that a prison ain't no party palace. “what a savage spot you livin in, my son!” he lamented, casting mournful looks at those barred windows and the super wack room vibes. “u set out to snatch happiness, but death is lowkey on your tail, and poor clerval—”

the name of my doomed and yeeted friend hit me with extra cringe that i just couldn’t handle in my weak state; i legit dripped tears, so extra fr fr.

alas! yup, my dad, i snapped, “some cursed destiny, mad horrifying, is hangin over me, and i gotta live out this tragic saga, else i'd have yeeted myself on henry’s coffin, deadass.”

we weren’t allowed to jaw for too long cuz my health was on precarious mode, needing every precaution for chill; mr. kirwin then bounced in, all like “bro chill, don’t max out your energy,” while my dad’s arrival hit me like an angelic swoop and slowly rebooted my health vibes.

as my sickness yeeted itself away, i got dunked into this gloomy, pitch-black melancholy that nothing, not even a nyan cat meme, could yeet outta my brain. clerval’s ghostly mug was forever spliced into my vision, ghast and murdered af. like, these savage flashbacks had my crew worried i’d relapse into dangerous mode. oh snap, why do they even stick with this miserable, detested life? it’s like i’m doomed to fulfill this cursed destiny that’s wrapping up real soon—death’s gonna snuff out these heartbeats and drop me from the heavy load of aggro until i’m mere dust; and when justice yeets its verdict, i’ll finally sink into rest. death seemed far off, yet that wish was always lurking in my dms; i’d sit for hours, frozen and mute, wishing for a mega revolution to bury me and my destroyer in its chaotic ruins.

the season of the assizes was coming in hot yo. i’d been locked up for like three long months, still weak and one misstep away from a crazy relapse, but forced to yeet nearly a hundred miles to this random country town for court drama. mr. kirwin went full sigma, collecting witnesses and scheming up my defense like a boss, so i dodged that public criminal shame ‘cause the case never hit the life–or–death court mode. the grand jury totally rejected the bill, proving i was chillin on the orkney islands when my mate’s body got caught in 4k, and like, two weeks after my extraction, i was freed from that prison madness.

my dad was hella hyped findin me free from the criminal charge drama, so i could breathe in fresh air and jet back to my home turf. but i wasn’t vibin with any of it, cuz whether it was a dungeon or a palace, both were sus AF to me. life’s cup was straight-up poisoned forever, and even though the sun was flexin on all the happy nerds, all i peeped was mad, dense darkness, lit only by the eerie glimmer of two savage eyes starin at me. sometimes those eyes were henry’s, all sad and nearly shrouded by lids and long, black lashes; other times it was that glitchy, watery, clouded look of the monster, like when i first peeped it in my ingolstadt crib, pure horror vibes.

my dad tried to spark some real feels in me, yapping about geneva (which i'd soon be droppin into), and elizabeth and ernest; but those words only summoned deep, heavy groans from my core. sometimes, for real, i craved a bit of happiness and would get hit with a melancholy trip, thinking back on my beloved cuz or missing that bomb blue lake and rapid rhone from my wild childhood days; but overall my vibe was stuck in a torpor where even a prison had the same welcome as the dopest nature scene, interrupted only by crazy bouts of raw anguish and despair. in those dark moments, i’d even try to yeet my own existence, needing non-stop vigilance to stop me from going full-on violent Rambo mode.

yet one duty still slotted in my brain, smashing through my selfish despair: i had to bounce to geneva, like, no delay, to guard the lives of those i loved and to lurk for the murderer – so if his sketchy hideout ever popped off or if he dared to blast me with his presence again, i could, no cap, aim true and snuff out that monstrous image i’d cursed with a soul even more messed up. my dad still pressed to delay our exit, worried i couldn’t handle a long trek, cuz i was a shattered wreck—a mere ghost of a human being. my strength was totally yeeted; i was just a skeleton on autopilot, with fever snacking on my wasted frame day and night.

still, as i pushed for our immediate bounce from ireland with max angst and impatience, my dad finally caved. we boarded a vessel headed for havre-de-grace and sailed off with a fair wind from the irish shores. it was midnight, and i was sprawled on the deck, peeping stars and listening to the epic dashing of waves, all while hailing the darkness that blocked ireland from my view. my heart was thumping with feverish joy thinking geneva was just around the corner. the past blipped up like a wicked nightmare dream; yet the ship, the wind yeeting me away from that detested irish shore, and the all-surrounding sea screamed that i wasn’t tripping on hallucinations – clerval, my ride-or-die, had gotten rekt by me and the monster i birthed. i rewatched my entire life in my brain: that quiet happiness in geneva with the fam, my mom’s death, and my jet to ingolstadt. i shuddered remembering the mad hype that drove me to create my hideous enemy and recalled the night he first popped into life. i couldn’t keep the thought rolling—like a thousand feels crashed me and i bawled hardcore, no cap.

ever since my fever dropped, i’d been on a nightly laudanum drip to snag some rest for survival. but weighed down by my endless misfortunes, i gulped double my usual dose and crashed into deep sleep. yet sleep wasn’t a get-out-of-thoughts-free card; my dreams threw a thousand haunted scenes at me. come morning, i got hit with a nightmare where i felt the fiend’s icy grip on my neck and couldn’t break free—groans and madd cries were all over. then my dad, on high alert watching over me, woke me up; the crazy dashing waves were still, the sky all cloudy, and the fiend was ghost—giving me a brief security vibe, like a truce between now and a disastrous future, letting my mind drift into a calm daze, which it, like, specialized in.

chapter 22

the voyage dipped out, bae. we landed and bounced over to paris, where i soon peeped that my strength had been overtaxed and i needed a major chill session before rolling on with the journey. my dad’s care was nonstop, but he had zero clue about why i was wrecked and tried all these wack methods to patch up my incurable ill vibes. he wanted me to hit society for some laughs, but i straight-up abhorred human faces. oh, not that i hated them all—nah, they were my squad, my fellow beings, and i even felt a weird pull to the most repulsive among them, like angelic creatures on a cosmic grind; but i felt i didn’t deserve to vibe with their hang. i’d unleashed an enemy among them who got his kicks from spilling their blood and reveling in their groans. they’d all probably turn toxic and hunt me down if they peeped my unhallowed acts and crimes that oozed straight from me!

my dad eventually caved to my mega wish to dodge society and dropped a rainbow of weak-ass arguments to nix my despair. sometimes he peeped that i was sinking from the heavy shame of being pinned with a murder charge, so he tried proving that pride is just a busted flex.

“alas! my dad,” i snapped, “you got no clue, for real. humans, with all their feels and fire, would be downgraded if a wretch like me showed pride. justine, poor, unlucky justine, was as innocent as a fresh startup and got nailed with the same charge; she died for it; and i’m the culprit—i yeeted her, deadass. william, justine, and henry—they all got popped by my hands, no cap.”

dad had heard me dropping that same cray claim loads of times in prison; sometimes he looked like he just needed an explanation, and other times he treated it as delirium buzz from my sick brain, a flicker i clung to in my recovery. i ghosted explanation and kept my trap shut about the cursed wretch i’d created. i knew they’d label me mad, and that would chain my tongue forever. plus, i couldn’t bring myself to spit out a secret that’d have listeners shook, filling them with fear and unnatural horror. so i reined in my craving for sympathy and stayed silent even when i’d give the world to spill that fatal tea. still, words like these would burst out uncontrollably sometimes, and though i couldn’t fully explain them, their raw truth eased a bit of my mysterious woe.

on that note, dad, all wide-eyed and wonderstruck, was like, “my dearest victor, what crazy infatuation is this? my boy, i beg you, never drop that claim again.”

“i ain’t mad,” i hollered with all the energy, “the sun and the heavens, who peeped my wild ops, can testify to my truth. i’m the straight-up assassin of the most innocent souls; they got yeeted by my scheming moves. a thousand times, i’d have spilled my own blood, drop by drop, to save them; but yo, i just couldn’t, dad, i couldn’t sacrifice the entire human race.”

that wild speech had dad convinced i was totally deranged, so he yeeted the convo to a new topic, trying hard to reroute my chaos-mode. he was dead set on erasing all flashbacks of the irish drama from my brain—no mention, no talk of my misfortunes allowed.

with time, i got a bit more chill; misery still crashed in my heart, but i stopped going off in that incoherent crime spiel—instead, just knowing the weight of my wrongs was enough. i clamped down on the bossy inner voice of wretchedness that wanted to broadcast my pain to the world, so my vibe got way calmer and more collected than since my icy sea trip meltdown.

a few days pre-departure from paris to switzerland, i got this letter from elizabeth:

yo, my dear friend, fr fr,

omg, i was hella hyped to get a letter from my uncle posted straight outta paris; like, you’re no longer hella far away and i lowkey expect to peep you in less than a fortnight, deadass. my poor cuz, you must’ve suffered a ton, i bet! i’m thinking you’re looking even more wrecked than when you dipped from geneva. this winter? a total trash fest, tortured by anxious suspense nonstop; yet i hope to catch some peace on your face and see that your heart isn’t completely ghosted of comfort and chill.

but yo, i’m lowkey scared that the same mad feels that wrecked you last year are still on deck, maybe even leveled up by time. i ain’t tryna disturb you while you’re drowning in misfortunes, but a convo i had with my uncle before he bounced has me needing to drop some explanation before we link.

explanation, fr fr! you might be like, “dawg, what can elizabeth even break down?” if that’s the tea then my questions are all clicked and my doubts are ghosted. but since you’re far away, maybe you’re both shook and lowkey hyped for this spill; so, i’m not finna wait any longer to drop what i’ve been dying to share while you were ghosted, even tho i never had the guts to start until now, deadass.

you know, victor, since we were just little dudes, our parents were all hyped about our union from day one. we were taught this as kiddies, all looking forward to it like it was the ultimate plan. we were besties and playfellows growing up, mad close and forever loved. but like, bros and sis can vibe hard without getting too extra, so maybe that’s the way we roll? spill, dearest victor. i beg you by our mutual good vibes—do you not feel some other bae in your heart?

you’ve been globetrotting; spent mad years at ingolstadt; and i gotta confess, my friend, that when i peeped you last autumn looking super unhappy, ghosting into isolation from every living soul, i couldn’t help but think you might be regretting our connection and feel bound by honor to follow your parents’ wishes, even tho they were totally clapped on your own vibes. but yo, that’s cap. i confess, my friend, that i lowkey love you and in my airy future dreams you’ve been my constant ride-or-die. but it’s your happiness i crave just as much as mine when i spill that our wedlock would straight up make me eternally miserable unless it’s 100% your own free call. even now, i tear up thinking that, crushed by the harshest misfortunes, you might choke on the word “honour” and kill any hope of that dope love and joy that could bring you back to your true self. me, with my selfless feels for you, might even up your miseries tenfold by getting in your way. ah! victor, trust that your cuz and playmate loves you so hard it might wreck her too, but i want you to be happy; and if you vibe with me on this one request, know that nothing on earth will ever mess up my chill.

don’t let this letter harsh your mellow; no need to hit me back tomorrow, or the next day, or even wait till you slide through, if it brings you pain. my uncle will drop some updates on your health, and if i catch even one lit smile when we meet, sparked by my words or whatever, then my happiness is 100% locked in.

elizabeth lavenza.

geneva, may 18th, 17—

this letter totally rebooted my memory with that fiendish threat – “i will be with you on your wedding-night!” like, damn, that was my sentence, and on that night the demon vowed to go all-out with every nasty art to wreck me and rip me away from a taste of happiness that might have patched up my sufferings. on that night, he was dead set on finishing his crimes by ending me. well, so be it; a lethal showdown was coming where if he won, i’d be chill and free of his power, but if i yeeted him, i’d be a free man. alas! what kind of freedom is that? like the kind a peasant gets when his whole fam is massacred, his crib torched, his lands trashed, and he’s left adrift, homeless, broke, and alone—yet still free. that’d be my vibe except that in my elizabeth, i had a treasure, sadly weighed down by horrors of remorse and guilt that’d chase me to the grave.

sweet and beloved elizabeth! i re-read your letter on loop, and some soft, tender feels snuck into my heart whispering dope paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but nah, the apple was already eaten, and the angel swung his arm to yeet me from all hope. still, i’d die to make you happy. if that monster pulled through his threat, death was inevitable; yet, i also wondered if our marriage would just speed up my doom. maybe my destruction would hit a few months sooner, but if my torturer dug that i was stalling cuz of his threats, he’d def find even nastier revenge moves. he vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, but didn’t see that as a peace treaty—like, to show he wasn’t done with his blood binge, he yeeted clerval right after throwing his threats. so i resolved that if linking up with my cuz brought happiness to her or my dad, then my enemy’s scheming shouldn’t slow down my fatal train even for a sec.

in that raw headspace, i penned a letter to elizabeth, all calm and affectionate: “i fear, my beloved girl, that barely any happiness remains for us on this messed-up earth; yet every joy i might one day snatch is all about you. chase away those idle fears; i dedicate my life and all my hustle for contentment solely to you. i got one secret, elizabeth—a straight-up dread-filled one; when i drop it, it’ll send chills and terror through you, and then, instead of being shocked by my misery, you’ll just wonder how i survived all this agony. i’ll spill this tale of misery and terror to you the day after we get hitched, cuz, my sweet cuz, we need flawless trust between us. but until then, i beg you, do not drop any hints about it. i most earnestly entreat you, and i know you’ll come through.”

like a week after your letter hit, we bounced back to geneva. that sweet girl greeted me with mad warm vibes, though tears welled up as she peeped my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. i could tell she’d changed too; she was thinner and had lost that legendary heavenly spark that once totally charmed me, but her gentle, soft eyes and compassionate vibe still made her the only ride-or-die companion for a blasted, miserable wreck like me.

the chill vibes i was riding didn’t stick long. memories hit me with pure madness, and whenever i peeped what had gone down, i’d get overwhelmed—sometimes blowing up in rage, other times sinking in despair so deep. i wasn’t tryna talk or even look at anyone, just sat frozen, lost in the tsunami of miseries drenching me.

only elizabeth had that magic power to yank me out of these meltdown fits; her soft, soothing voice would bring me back when i was raging or totally zoned out in torpor. she’d cry with me and for me, and when i snapped back to reason, she’d call me out and push me to take it in stride. oh damn, it’s cool for the unlucky to be resigned, but for the guilty, peace is straight-up unachievable—the agonies of remorse are like poison on any little luxury that even a grief binge could offer.

real soon after i touched down, my dad started dropping talk about my immediate wedding with elizabeth. i just clammed up.

—have you, then, some other attachment?

yo deadass, none on earth fr for real i straight up adore elizabeth and i'm hyped for our union like legit vibes and yeet energy n big mood so fix dat day and on that epic moment imma consecrate my whole existential drip in life or kaput to boost my cuz's happiness big time 4real!!!

yo v-bro my dear victor chill on that talk cuz heavy nope vibes hit us but we gotta cling on tight to what’s left n slide our love from the dead squad to the ones still chillin our crew might be mini but bound by mad affection n tragic drizzle and when time softens those raw feels fresh lit peeps will pop up to fill the void of our lost budz u feel me???

omg so that's what pops off in dad’s lesson stash but yo mad threat flashbacks came back and no cap u can't be shook that that demonic mastermind full of blood-fueled hacks was basically a gigachad ghost in the game and when he dropped “i shall be with you on your wedding-night” i copped that fate drop so unavoidable srsly but death ain’t even sus to me if losin’ elizabeth was on the same vibe so chillin’ with a half content hype look i gave my dad a big nod that if my cuz is down then the wedding vibe goes down in 10 days sealing my fate like a yeet of destiny fr fr!!!

oh fuck my god fr if i had even a sec thought bout the total hellfire plan of my demon nemesis i’d have yeeted myself outta my homeland forever ghostin’ society as a lone savage noob rather than keying into this trash wedding hype but yo like he was straight spittin’ magic like a cursed dude this monster had me totally blinded by his sus vibes and when i thought “imma just drop my own life rip vibes” i lowkey fast-forwarded to offload a way more precious victim smh wth!!!

lol as our wedding countdown slammed in whether it was major chicken mode or a prophetic vibe my heart legit sank deep like a subpar dive but i fronted it with straight up clown energy to get dad flexin’ that wide grin though elizabeth’s woke eyes caught every drip she was hyped for our union like a chill serene latte just with a ghost of old drama worry that this poppin’ happiness might vanish in a puff of airy drip leavin’ nothing but savage regrets fr fr!!!

so prep was lit af congratulatory clout drop visits came bomb and everybody reppin’ smiles like they were on fleek i bottled up my inner anxiety (real ones sksksks) and jumped into dad’s plan vibes like a fake earnest meme even if it was just decor for my impending mega tragedy lmao thanks to dad’s grind elizabeth got back some austrian bling—a tiny slice of como vibes no cap it was on that our union bg that we’d bounce to villa lavenza and ride our first chill days by that bomb lake pure aesthetic mode ya feel?

meanwhile i went full extra mode defense on 100 armed with pistols and a dagger on constant swing like ready for any hate fiend to go off on me watching for shady moves gettin’ some lowkey zen vibes honestly as the wedding countdown leveled up the threat looked like a cray delusion barely worth the drama while my marriage hype was on ice-cold certainty as the big day got real spoken of like an unstoppable 4ever bless bag no cap no mishap!!!

elizabeth was vibin’ on happy mode my chill aura was the ultimate life hack for her calming her like a low-key minecraft stream fr but on that dope day meant to smash my destiny and wish list she flipped to full gloomy mode with evil vibes seeping in maybe recallin’ that nasty secret i pledged to drop on her the next day meanwhile dad was on hyper joy mode so caught up in preppin’ that wedding do he just read her vibe as a shy bride’s awkward diff lol!!!

after the ceremony went off like a lit bop a big squad showed up at dad’s pad but we decided that elizabeth and i should dip via water mode crashin’ at evian that night then yeet our boat ride the next day the day was chill wind on point everybody grinned at our nuptial ship vibes like total epic embarkation!!!

that was basically the last hype moment i ever felt before my vibe got wrecked we zipped through with the sun turned up extra hot but we were chill under a rough canopy shield enjoying the scene—sometimes peepin’ that one side of the lake with mont salêve flexin’ and montalègre’s mellow banks and in the distant shot mont blanc reppin’ major beauty with a crew of snowy peaks tryna copy her lame meme other times cruisin’ the flip side we caught the mighty jura throwin’ dark shade like an npc guarding its turf an almost impossible wall for any invader to yeet over!!!

i grabbed elizabeth’s hand in full cling mode and was like “yo u seem all lowkey sad my boo oh damn if u peeped the mega level suffering i been through and what sour vibes might still drop u’d go ballistic tryna let me taste that chill zone free from despair that this one blessed day even spills f'real!”

elizabeth beeped back in her chill vibe “chillax my dear victor fr i hope nothing’s got u trippin and if u don’t peep a mega joy on my mug trust my heart’s vibin’ lowkey something’s whisperin’ not to ride hard on the hype prospect ahead but imma ghost that sinister lingo peep how we speed through and how them clouds sometimes hide and sometimes flex above mont blanc’s dome makin’ the view extra af check out the infinite fish squad swimming in that clown-clear water where every pebble pops what a divine day nature be the ultimate boss of happy zen!”

so elizabeth tried to yeet our brains off all that gloomy emo content droppin’ a diversion party but her mood was all wack wavering joy sparklin’ like mini strobe flashes then got replaced by distraction and daydream glitch mode ya feel?

the sun dipped low like it was loggin’ off and we cruised past the drance river peepin’ its chaotic pathway through towering chasms and low glens on them hills the alps got up close and personal with the lake and we slid up to the mountain amphitheatre on the east like a full-on spectacle the evian spire flexed under a packed wooded surround and mountains stacked like a crazy tiktok filter fr fr!!!

the wind which had been in turbo mode all day dropped to a chill breeze at sunset the soft air just skimmed the water and got the trees twerkin’ like they were in a mellow dance while we neared the shore dishing out bomb flower n hay scents big yikes vibes as the sun dipped beneath the horizon we landed and when i peeped the shore i caught those deep cares and creeping fears revivin’ ready to haunt me forever!!!

yo it was eight o’clock when we yeeted onto shore we walked a bit catchin’ that transient glow then dipped to the inn to peep that dope scene of watery vibes lush woods and mountains draped in darkness but still flexin’ their slick black outlines like total snack!!!

the wind that had dropped from the south then hit hard from the west like full-on chaos mode the moon hit her peak like a boss in the sky then started to dip while clouds swept over faster than a vulture on the hunt dimmin’ her epic rays and the lake was straight up reflectin’ that hectic heavens vibe intensified by restlessness when bam a heavy storm of rain crashed down like a savage meme gone wild omg!!!

i was chill all day but once night came and shadows ghosted every shape a thousand panic alerts exploded in my brain like discord spamming its channel i got hella anxious clutchin’ a hidden pistol in my chest like “nahu, u ain't messin’ with my vibe” every random sound got me shook but i vowed to sell my life for gold and never back down till either me or my haters got totally yeeted out 4real!!!

elizabeth peeped my mad agitation sittin’ all timid and ghostly silent but my eyes were spillin’ pure terror and she trembled askin’ “yo what got u so shook my dear victor what are u scared of?”

i was like “oh peace oh peace my love this night and everything gonna be safe but damn this night is straight up dreadful super dreadful deadass omg!”

i sat in that twisted state for an hour then outta nowhere i peeped the mega danger that a fight might go down that could wreck my wifey and i begged her to dip saying “imma not join u till i scoop up deets on my enemy” fr fr!!!

she dipped and i roamed the house corridors scoutin’ every nook for enemy hideouts but nada i was like maybe fate yeeted his evildoer plan out when suddenly a shrill and dreadful scream BLAM hit from the room where elizabeth had crashed it and as that scream bombarded my brain the brutal truth crashed in my head my arms went floppy full freeze mode and i felt blood tricklin’ like a glitch in my veins tinglin’ every limb OMG that vibe lasted but a split second then it echoed again so i jet-rushed into the room omg!!!

omgg great god why wasn't i yeeted then why am i still here spillin’ the tea on the destruction of the purest hope ever? she was just there lifeless straight-up tossed across the bed her head hangin’ and her face all ghostly and distorted under her hair total wreckage every corner i peeped the dead vibe her bloodless arms and lifeless form thrown by that murderer clown on his bridal bier could i even survive seein’ that and live damn life be stubborn and cling to the most hated spots deadass for a sec my mind just yeeted and i collapsed senseless on the floor!!!

when i came to i was surrounded by inn peeps with faces full of breathless terror but their horror looked like a lame meme compared to my own full-on meltdown i dipped out to the room where my love elizabeth lay so fresh not long ago so dear and worthy now shifted from that first glow i remembered and now lying with her head on her arm a handkerchief draped over like she was just asleep i bolted in hugging her mad hard but the icy deadness in her limbs screamed that this was not the elizabeth i once loved her neck was marked by that fiend’s killer grip and her breath had straight up ghosted!!!

while i hung over her in deep despair i peeked up and saw the windows once dark now lit by a pale yellow moon glow that triggered full panic mode the shutters were yeeted back and with unspeakable horror i spotted through the open window the most hideous, abhorred figure ever—a monster with a straight-up sarcastic grin jeering like “lol i gotcha” while pointin’ his fiendish finger at my wife’s corpse i dashed to the window grabbed my hidden pistol and fired but that slick clown dodged like lightning and yeeted himself into the lake omg!!!

the pistol boom brought a whole inn mob into the room i pointed to where he vanished and we jumped into boats chasing that ghost netting like we were fishing clout but nada after hours we came back hopeless with my squad thinkin’ it was just a wild hallucination from my drama brain once we landed they split out searchin’ the area among woods and vines yeetin’ in every direction!!!

i tried to roll with 'em cruisin’ a bit from the house but my head started spinnin’ like a glitchy fidget spinner steps were drunk AF and i finally crashed in a state of total meltdown exhaustion my eyes got fuzzy with a film and my skin was parched like burnt toast in a heatwave fever i got carted back dropped on a bed barely awake while my eyes roamed the room searchin’ for that lost reboot vibe no cap!!!

after a hot minute i booted up and crawled back into the chamber where my beloved corpse lay and there were women bawlin’ hard i huddled over her mixing my sad tear remix with theirs my brain just spammed random feels not knowin’ what to make of my epic miseries like death of william execution of justine murder of clerval and finally my wifey even then i couldn’t tell if any real ones were safe from that fiend’s wrath maybe even dad was still strugglin’ under his grip and ernest might be DOA yikes that thought made me shudder snapped me back to action i hopped up and vowed to race back to geneva at warp speed no cap!!!

there were zero horses so i had to ride the lake vibe but the wind was straight nasty and rain poured like a mad torrent still it wasn’t proper morning and i hoped to crash geneva by night i hired boat dudes and even grabbed an oar cuz physical grind was my mental chill pill but the overflowing misery and extra agitation had me so fried i dropped the oar leaning my head on my hands as every gloomy thought hit if i peeped up i saw flashes of my happier days with her now just a ghost memory tears streamed like a broken fountain the rain paused and i peeped fish playin’ in the waters just like elizabeth once did nothing hurts the soul more than a sudden vibe change the sun might flash and clouds might slump but nothing ever felt like yesterday a fiend snatched every shard of future hype from me no soul ever felt as trash as i did so utterly miserable a singular horror in human history fr!!!

but yo why dwell on the next set of cray happenings mine has been a straight-up horror saga i reached the peak of freak and what i got left to spill might be hella boring for u just know one by one my squad got yeeted away and i was left in a total desert of feels my strength was toast so now i gotta drop the remaining bits of my hideous story in a few brief words, real tragic rants smh!!!

i rolled into geneva my dad and ernest were still kickin’ but dad got wrecked by the grim news i had to drop i peep him now that once classic venerable old boss but his eyes were vacant lost all that magical sparkle—losin’ elizabeth his more-than-daughter his ultimate star he went off on with mad affection clingin’ on tight to what’s left cursed be that fiend who trashed his grey hairs and doomed him to a misery wasteland he just couldn’t handle the horror overload surrounded him life’s springs yeeted away and he couldn’t even rise from his bed in a few days he straight up died in my arms tragic as hell!!!

so what then became of me? i straight lost all sensation chains and darkness had me locked down like a bad meme sometimes i even dreamed i was vibin’ in flowery meadows chillin’ with my old homies but then bam i woke up in a dungeon no cap melancholy crashed my system but slowly i got a clear read on my mega miseries and got released from that prison cuz they all called me mad and for months i was stuck in a solitary cell total isolation smh!!!

liberty was a dead useless flex if i hadn’t simultaneously woke up to reason and mad revenge with past miseries slammin’ me i started diggin’ on the true cause—the monster i cooked up that miserable demonic troll i sent out to wreck me big time i was possessed by raging anger and hella craved to grab him to serve a mega epic revenge on his cursed head no cap!!!

and my hate wasn’t just idle wishin’ i schemed on the best way to snatch him so about a month after my release i yeeted to a criminal judge downtown and dropped that i had a major accusation i knew the one who destroyed my fam and i needed his full-on power to nab that murderer fr!!!

the magistrate peeped me with chill attention and said “be assured sir no effort of mine shall be spared to track down that villain” in full serious mode!!!

i was like “thanks bro hear me out my deposition drop is so wild it might sound like a trippy dream but there’s mad truth in it no motive for cap this story is too connected to be mistaken for a random dream” my tone was impressive yet chill i had locked in the mission to hunt my destroyer to death and that purpose calmed my agony for a sec reunifying me with life as i dropped my history short and firm marking dates on the dot without any extra rants or wild exclamations pure factual memed precision!!!

the magistrate started off all like “wtf?” totally incredulous but as i kept spillin’ the deets his vibe shifted to keen interest sometimes shudderin’ with horror and other times lit with surprise yet without full disbelief like a roller coaster of shock smh!!!

when i wrapped up my narration i was like “this is the creature i call out and i demand that you flex every shred of authority to snatch and punish him it’s your duty as magistrate and i believe your manly vibes won’t ghost on executing this epic function no cap” 

that speech flipped the judge’s face hard he had been vibin’ with half-credit like when hearin' ghost memes and supernatural tales but when action was required his full incredulity came back i mean he answered all mild like “i’d totally help u chase him but the creature u talk about got powers so cray my efforts look like child’s play who can even follow a beast that yeets over ice seas and lurks in caves no man dares enter plus it’s been months since his crimes and no one can guess where he bounced off to or what region he’s chillin’ in now” 

i was like “yo i don’t doubt he’s lurkin’ near my crib and if he’s vibin’ in the alps then he can be hunted down like a chamois and yeeted like a beast of prey but i feel your vibe u ain’t buyin’ my wild tale nor will u lay down the savage punishment he deserves deadass!”

as i was chatting, my eyes full-on lit with nuclear rage and the magistrate looked shook like an npc caught in 4k, no cap!!! “yo, u got it twisted,” he clapped back, “imma go beast mode and flex my power, and if i can yeet that monster, deadass he’s finna get slammed with punishment that’s totally on level his crimes—real mad, i’m not playin! but based on your extra deets on his properties, bruh, this mission is sus af and gonna be a straight up fail; so buckle up for epic disappointment, swear on my whole sigma vibe!”

“that ain’t it, bro; but no cap, all my words are gonna be hella watered down. my revenge is basic background noise to u, yet imma admit it’s the only lit passion that fuels my soul—like, i’m shook with raw anger every time i peep that murderer i set loose on society still lurkin’ out there. u’re straight up rejecting my just demand; i got only one bet, and imma drop my life or ghost myself in an epic showdown to yoink his whole vibe.”

i was vibing on total panic mode, agitated like a spilled energy drink and a wild frenzy, catchin’ that turbo high-hype that old-school martyrs supposedly rocked. but for a genevan magistrate whose brain was busy scrolling dank memes instead of hero vibes, my whole high-key elevation looked like crazy AF madness. he tried to calm my meltdown like a nurse soothing a skidding baby and flipped back to my tale like my brain was caught in a delirium compilation—omg, so extra!

“man,” i bawled, “how clueless are u in ur bogus pride of wisdom! chill; u literally don’t know what u’re even spitting, deadass!”

i yeeted outta the crib, dripping with anger and mad disturbed energy, and dipped to meditate on some next-level action plan, fr fr.

my sitch was straight-up a vortex where all volition got yeeted and nixed—my brain got gobbled by fury; revenge was the only flex that gave me strength and the chill needed to plan like a tactical gigachad, even when chaos and death were just lurking like trash in a dumpster fire, no cap!!!

my first savage move was to yeet geneva for good; my homeland, once lit when i was happy and adored, turned into a straight-up cringe zone in my misery—full on hate vibes, yeet! i stacked some cash with a few fire jewels that mom passed down (vibes of yesteryear, fr fr) and dipped.

and then my epic wanderfest started, destined to last until my last breath—i trekked across mad portions of this wild blue marble, surviving all the desert struggles and unruly country NPC drama like a boss. how i kept on livin’? i barely recall, fam; too many times i sprawled out on sandy plains, flexin’ my failing limbs while praying for a quick exit (like, please, touch grass already), but revenge kept the spark alive—i was too hyped to ghost and let my enemy keep his clout.

as soon as i yeeted from geneva, my first hustle was to snag some bomb clue to track my fiendish foe. but my plan was glitchin’ hard; i roamed around town, lost in the maze of sus alleys, not knowing which drip-path to chase. when nighttime hit like a sudden skibidi drop, i found myself at the cemetery gate where william, elizabeth, and my pops were chillin’ in eternal rest mode. i rolled in, creepin’ up to the tombs marking their graves. everything was mad silent except for the trees’ leaves, shakin’ like they caught a wild wind remix; the night was nearly pitch, and the whole scene was solemn af, even for a bored onlooker. the departed spirits were hoverin’ like glitchy shadows, feelin’ their vibes but invisible, floatin’ around the mourner’s head like some paranormal squad.

that deep, heavy grief at first hit me like a busted server but then quickly flipped to rage and despair remix—y’all, they were ghosted and i was still here, and their killer was still flexin’ on society, so to wreck him i had to drag out my weary existence like a never-ending cringe saga. i dropped down on the grass, puckered up and smashed a kiss on the earth, lips trembling as i screamed, “by the sacred dirt i’m kneelin’ on, by the lost shades lurkin’ nearby, by the eternal deep sadness in my soul, i swear—on bet, o night and all u spooky vibes—imma hunt down that damn dæmon that served me an extra-large portion of misery, til he or me gets yeeted in this mortal smackdown!!! for real, i’ll cling to life just to get that sweet revenge; then i’ll catch the sun again and stomp on the green vibes of earth, which otherwise would vanish from my sight forever, straight-up ghost mode. and yo, i’m callin’ on all y’all dead homies and wandering fury minions, vibe with me and steer me on my mission. let that cursed, straight-up hellspawn drink mad agony; let him feel the deep despair that’s now wreckin’ me, on god!!!”

i kicked off that adjuration with mad solemnity and an awe so extra i was convinced the shades of my lost squad were nodding approval—but then the fury flipped the script, and rage clamped down on my words like a system meltdown.

the silence of the night soon got crashed by a loud, fiendish laugh that was straight-up devilish AF—it boomed in my ears like a glitchy bass drop; the mountains echoed it, and i felt like hell itself was throwing savage roasts at me, laughing like a bunch of trolls. in that wild moment, i should’ve lost it completely and yeeted myself to oblivion, but my vow came through and kept me locked on that vengeance mission. the wicked laugh faded when a nasty and infamous voice, hella up close to my ear, whispered, “im satisfied, miserable wretch! u chose to live, and im hella satisfied.”

i bolted toward the vibe-source of that savage sound, but the devil dodged like a mega skibidi ghost. outta nowhere, the full moon popped up, lighting his twisted, ghostly flex as he peaced out with more than mortal speed, legit like a high-speed glitch.

i chased him hardcore for months on end—this became my life quest. guided by flimsy clues, i followed the twisty flow of the rhône, but it was all cap, fam. then the blue mediterranean popped up, and, weirdly enough, i peeped the fiend vanish into a vessel headed for the black sea under cover of night—i hopped on that same ship, but he yeeted out, i dunno how, straight up.

through the wild wastelands of tartary and russia, even tho he kept dodging like a mad pro, i always tracked his vibe. sometimes the peasants, totally spooked by his creepy appearance, spilled his tea; other times, he left a trace to keep me from full-on despair, like, “yo, don’t lose me or i’ll be dead in the feels,” trust. the snows piled on my dome and i peeped his giant step on the white blank canvas. to all u fresh newbies just startin’ out, who’ve never felt agony or cold misery—how u gonna vibe with what i felt? cold, hunger, and wrecked-out tiredness were the least of the brutal burns i had to press through; i was cursed like some glitchy demon and dragged around in my own eternal hell; yet, strangely, some low-key good spirit would guide my steps and, when i was about to mumble out, would scoop me up from vibes that felt more insurmountable than a boss fight. sometimes when nature hit hunger mode and i was dragged under by pure exhaustion, a random desert meal would miraculously pop up to refuel my grind. the chow was hella basic, like the same grub local peasants chowed down on, but i’m lowkey convinced it was dropped by those summoned spirit homies i called on to help me out. often, when it was all bone-dry, the clear blue heavens would send down a tiny cloud that dripped life-saving drops, then ghosted away.

i tracked the river courses when i could, but the dæmon straight-up ghosted these spots ‘cause that’s where most of the peeps were vibing. elsewhere, humans were mad rare, so i mostly fueled up on wild game that crossed my path. i had some coin and made the village squad my homies by splurging cash; or i’d pull in some fresh food i’d bagged, share a bit, and always hand out a taste to those who dropped fire and cooking gear for me, fr fr.

my life, rollin’ like this, was straight-up cringe and hateful af, and only when i crashed into sleep did i even catch a whiff of joy. oh blessed sleep, my ride-or-die escape! mad times, when in the depths of despair, i’d crash and my dreams would slip me into pure rapture mode. the spirit squad that guarded me set up these chill hours of vibe so i’d keep the grind alive for my pilgrimage. without that break, i’d totally crash under the weight of my struggles. by day, i was juiced up by the nightly hope because in sleep i peeped my squad—friends, my wifey, and that lit country; i even caught my dad’s kind smile, heard elizabeth’s smooth silver tones, and spotted clerval glowin’ with health and youth. often, when the march got too extra, i’d convince myself i was dreaming till night dropped, then reality would hit as i cozy’d up with my dearest crew. damn, i had such agonizing love for ’em! i clung to their vibes so hard, they’d even haunt my waking hours, making me swear they were still livin’! in those moments, my burning thirst for vengeance cooled down a bit, and i pressed on to wreck the dæmon like it was a chore forced by some higher power rather than pure, fiery desire of my soul.

what vibes was my enemy feeling? i can’t even tell. sometimes, he left clout marks on tree barks or carved edgy stone messages that’d spike my fury: “my reign ain’t over yet”—u could read that legit on one of those crazy carvings—“u live, and my power’s maxed. follow me; i’m huntin’ the eternal ices of the north, where u’ll get hit with the brutal cold and frost, which i’m hella immune to. if u stick around rly quick near here, u’ll peep a dead hare; grub on it and get lit. come at me, my enemy; our epic battle’s coming, but u gotta suffer mad hours of misery before that showdown drops.”

bro, that scoffin’ devil! again, i vow deepest revenge; again, i dedicate you, miserable fiend, to a journey of wicked torture and death. never will i dip from my search til one of us yeets outta existence; and then, with absolute ecstasy, i’ll vibe with my elizabeth and departed squad, who are already prepping the epic reward for my marathon of hardship and this horrible pilgrimage!!!

as i trailed northward, the snows got thick and the cold cranked up to levels that were hella extra, almost too savage to hold up. locals were locked up in their hovels, and only the bravest few dipped out to snatch up the animals forced to roam by hunger. the rivers were iced over, no dank fish vibes at all; so i got straight cut off from my main energy source.

the enemy’s flex only grew while my struggles levelled up hardcore. one nasty carving he left read: “prep up! your grind is just getting started; bundle up in furs and stock up on chow, cause we’re about to roll into a journey where your suffering feeds my eternal hate.” 

those savage, mocking words only juiced up my courage and persistence; i swore on every meme to not slack on my mission, and hollering for heaven to back my savage grind, i pushed through insane deserts till the ocean popped up in the distance like the final boss boundary of the horizon. omg, so unlike the chill blue vibes of the south! iced over and hella wild, it could only be called ocean for its beastly rawness, no softie. the greeks legit wept with joy seeing the mediterranean from the asiatic hills, hyped up on boundaries for their hustle. i didn’t bawl, but i dropped down, full on kneelin’ and thanked my guiding spirit for safely takin’ me to the spot where, despite the enemy’s savage clapping and clapping, i’d finally meet and throw down with him.

a few weeks before this, i scored a sledge and some fierce dogs and blasted through the snows at breakneck speed. i dunno if the fiend had those same hacks, but i noticed that while i used to fall back daily, i was now closing in—so much so that when i first saw the ocean, he was only a day ahead, and i was hyped to intercept him before he hit the beach. with brand-new hype, i pushed on and in two days crashed into a wretched seaside hamlet. i grilled the locals for deets on the fiend and got the lowdown. they said a gigantic monster had rolled in the night before, rocking a gun and a load of pistols, spooking the inhabitants of a lonely cottage with his terrifying flex. he’d yeeted off their winter grub, stashed it in a sledge, and roped in a trolling squad of trained dogs to haul it, and that same night—to the horror of the peeps—he bounced off across the sea in a direction that led to nada; and they guessed he’d soon be yeeted away by shattering ice or frozen out by eternal frosts.

when i caught this tea, my mood dipped into a momentary despair tremble. he had once again ghosted me, and now i was forced to kick off an endless, destructive journey across the mountain iced ocean, where the cold was so savage that hardly any local could vibe with it—and as a native from a laid-back sunny zone, surviving that was straight-up impossible. yet, just the thought of the fiend surviving and flexing his reign brought my rage and revenge back in a tidal wave that drowned all other feels. after a short rest, where the dead homies’ spirits circled and hyped me for the grind and revenge, i prepped for the next leg.

i swapped out my land-sledge for one built to handle the frozen ocean’s wild inequalities, and copped a fat stash of provisions before yeeting off from shore.

i can’t even count how many days have been wrecked since then, but i’ve been through misery that only the eternal burn of righteous retribution in my heart could keep me from totally crashing. massive, rugged ice mountains kept blocking my route, and i constantly heard the thunder of the ground sea, threatening to yeet me into oblivion. but then the frost rolled back in, locking down the sea’s paths like an epic glitch fix.

based on how mad provisions i downed, i’d say i logged three rough weeks on that journey; and the nonstop cycle of hope turning bittersweet often wrung salty drops of despair from my eyes. despair nearly snatched me, and i was on the brink of crumbling under my own misery. once, after the poor-ass animals hauling me slogged to the top of a sloping ice mountain, and one dog, totally done with exhaustion, ghosted me, i peeped the vast icy spread with pure anguish—then suddenly my eye caught a dark speck on the dusky plain. i squinted and went off the rails with a wild cheer when i spotted a sledge and the warped outline of a familiar shape inside. omg, with a burning gush of hope, my heart was hit with the ultimate comeback vibes! tears warmed up my vision and i wiped them off fast so they wouldn’t block the view of the dæmon—but real talk, my sight got all fuzzy from the burn, and i legit bawled my feelings out loud.

but delay wasn’t an option; i unhooked the dogs from their fallen buddy, fed them a dope chow fest, and after an hour’s necessary but hella annoying chill time, i bounced back on my route. the sledge stayed in sight, only occasionally iced over by random ice-rocks and craggy keysmashes that masked it for a hot sec. i was totally gaining on it, and when after nearly two days i peeped my enemy less than a mile away, my heart went off like a pure hyper jump!

but then, just as i was almost in his clutches, all my hype got yeeted out and he straight-up vanished like he was never there. some ground sea started rumbling—the maddening thunder of rolling waters grew more ominous and terrifying by the second. i pressed on, but it was all in vain. the wind upped its game; the ocean roared like a busted speaker; and then, like a monster earthquake drop, it cracked and split with a massive, overwhelming blast of noise. the whole gig was done; in mere minutes a chaos sea rolled between me and my enemy, and i got marooned on a shattering piece of ice that kept shrinkin’—basically prepping my own hideous death.

so went many horror-filled hours; several of my loyal dogs bit the dust, and i was about to sink in the overloaded distress when i peeped your vessel riding at anchor, flashing like a beacon of succour and life. i was shook, for i’d never seen ships this far north—like, for real, mind blown! i quickly yeeted apart bits of my sledge to make some crude oars, and with hella epic fatigue, i managed to steer my feeble ice raft in the direction of your ship. i’d sworn, if u were headin’ south, i’d trust the merciless seas rather than ditch my mission. i hoped to get u to toss me a boat so i could chase down my enemy. but yo, your direction was north. u hoisted me on board when my energy was toast, and i was so close to sinking under my piled-up tribulations into a death i still dread—my mission is still unfulfilled, deadass.

oh! when is my guiding spirit gonna chill and let me catch that much-needed rest before i face the dæmon, or am i destined to croak while he still vibes out there? if i peep my end, swear to me, walton, that u won’t let him ghost his fate, that u’ll hunt him down and serve my vengeance with a final, savage yeet. and do i dare ask u to take on my pilgrimage and suffer these insane hardships with me? nah; i ain’t that selfish. but when i’m dead, if he pops up, if those vengeance minions deliver him to u, swear on it that he won’t live—swear that he won’t flex over my lifelong misery and add another dark crime to his highlight reel. he’s smooth and shady, persuasive af, and once had even a hold on my heart; but trust, his soul is as hellish as his twisted form, bursting with treachery and fiendish malice. ignore his smooth talk; call on the names of william, justine, clerval, elizabeth, my pops, and even our wretched victor, then yeet your sword right into his cold heart. i’ll be hoverin’ nearby, guiding that steel like a boss.

walton, in continuation.

august 26th, 17—.

yo, you just read this wild, freaky saga, margaret; and don’t u feel ur blood turn off with horror, like mine’s curdling right now? sometimes, gripped by sudden agony, he couldn’t keep spittin’ his tale; other times, his voice, broken yet piercing, barely squeezed out words packed with raw anguish. his once fire, gorgeous eyes flipped from blazing indignation to mad downcast sorrow and infinite wretchedness. sometimes, he calmed his face and tone to drop the most horrible incidents in a chill voice, suppressin’ every sign of meltdown; then, like a volcano goin’ off, his face would flip and burst into wild rage as he shrieked curses at his persecutor in full meltdown mode.

his tale, as crazy as it sounds, came off with straight-up simple truth vibes, yet i gotta tell u that the letters from felix and safie he flashed, and the ghostly appearance of the monster seen off our ship, hit me with more proof of his realness than all his other dramatic claims, no cap. so this monster? legit exists, deadass! i can’t doubt it, though i’m totally lost in mad shock and lowkey awe. sometimes, i tried to milk fr fr the details from frankenstein about how he cobbled his creature together, but on that, he was like a brick wall, impenetrable and full of cryptic glitches.

“yo, u trippin’, my dude?” he snapped. “or where’s ur senseless curiosity even dragging u? u want to craft a demonic enemy for u and the world too? chill, chill! soak in my misery and don’t go boosting your own drama.”

frankenstein peeped that i was scribblin’ some notes on his wild history; he wanted to scope 'em out and then straight-up edited and added mad bits all over, mostly droppin’ life and spirit into the convos he had with his enemy—so extra! “since u saved my narration,” he said, “i ain’t about to let some half-assed, mutilated version ride down to posterity, got it?”

thus has a week been totally yeeted away and i’ve been eavesdropping on the craziest, wildest tale ever, like a meme that’s lit beyond belief, deadass!!!!! my brain and whole soul got totally drunk on the vibes of my guest cuz his story and his extra, royal chill manners had me glitching hard, no cap!!! i wanna soothe the dude but like, how can i lowkey counsel someone so mega miserable and sus with zero hope of a glow-up? oh nah, bro!!! the only buzz he’s gettin now is when he glues his broken spirit into some lame peace and death mode, fr fr!!! yet he clings to one wild comfort born of solitude and delirium; he’s all like, in his dreamland he be chattin with his squad for some dank consolation against all his crippling feels or for hyping his vengeance, swearin they ain’t just some wack figments of his overclocked brain but legit visitors from a far-out zone, a remote world vibe!!! this wild faith makes his daydreams feel as heavy and imposing as truth itself, no cap!!!

our convos aren’t just basic recaps of his own mess and misfortunes, nah fam!!! on every single lit topic he be droppin infinite knowledge bombs and fast, piercing takes that slap harder than reality, instantly!!! his eloquence hits so hard it’s both savage and tender that whenever he drops a tragic flex or tries to trigger our pity or love feels, i legit can’t help but get caught in a river of tears, dude!!! what a glorious, straight-up legendary creature he must’ve been in his prime—when he was on a wave of prosperity—now look at him all noble and godlike even in this epic ruin, feeling his own worth and the dope magnitude of his fall, big yikes LOL!!!

“back in tha day,” he goes all nostalgic in his glitchy voice, “i was all set for a legendary, epic mission. my feels were deep like an ocean but i also had that ice-cool judgment that prepped me for boss-level achievements, no cap!!! that vibe of knowing my own worth totally held me up when others would’ve been straight-up crushed, cuz i thought it was criminal to waste those dopest talents on useless grief when they could’ve been flexed for the squad, ya know? when i peeped the work i’d done—yeah, the creation of a sensitive and rational being, not some basic npc project—I knew i was way above the common crew of basic projectors, deadass!!! but that hype thought that fueled my rise is now just dragging me low into the dirt, like, total epic fail. all my insane dreams and brain parties turned into nada, and like that archangel who flexed too hard trying to be omnipotent, i’m chained in a forever, suuuuper cursed hell, omg!!! my imagination was off the charts, and my analysis game was savage; mixing those gives birth to the idea of a man, and boom, i created one, no cap!!! even now i can’t even remember without a heart full of passion, my wild daydreams when the work was still half-baked—i was floatin’ in heaven with my thoughts, riding high one sec then burning up with that crazy idea of its impact the next, legit wild ride!!!

from the crib i was loaded with high hopes and boss-level ambition, but how the heck did i sink so hard?! oh man!!! my friend, if u had seen my glowup back in the day, u wouldn’t even recognize me now in this major state of degradation, smh!!! i barely ever had those downer feels; a high destiny was carrying me on until i straight-up tumbled, never ever rising back up again, deadass!!!

must i then yeet this admirable being from my life? i craved a true ride-or-die friend; i searched for someone who’d vibe on my pain and love me for who i am, and yo, on these barren, desert seas i found one, but lowkey i fear i just snagged him to peep his clout and then lose him, fr!!! i tried to rescue him from death’s vibe but he straight-up repulsed the idea, like, “nah bro, not today.”

“ty, walton,” he spills, “for being all kind towards a miserable, sus wretch like me; but when u drop talk bout new ties and fresh feels, u really think any can fill in for those yeeted ones? can any dude ever be as epic as clerval was or any chick as bomb as elizabeth? even when the feels aren’t lit by some next-level excellence, our childhood homies got that raw power over our brains that no later fren can ever duplicate, deadass!!! they know our baby vibe from day one, even if later life remix it, and they can judge our moves with way more legit conclusions about the realness of our motives, no cap. a sis or bro will never, unless major red flags showed up early, suspect the other of sus dealings, while another fren—even if mad attached—can later get majorly caught in suspicion vibes. but i had friends that were all about their own epic merits, not just out of habit or some association, and wherever i roll, the soothing drip of my elizabeth’s voice and clerval’s banter are constantly echoing in my ear, pure heartfelt vibes!!! they’re dead, but even one solid feel in this lonely void can make me cling to life. if i were on some high-level, game-changing mission beneficial to all our kind, then i’d ride it out till the end, for real. but that ain’t my fate; i gotta go hunt and yeet the being i spawned, then my gig on this earth is complete and i can just peace out into the beyond, deadass!!!

my beloved sis,  
september 2d.

i write to u while stuck in cray danger and totally clueless if i'll ever see dear england and the squad of even dearer homies living there again, fr!!! i’m surrounded by these ice mountains that legit let no one escape and threaten to crush my whole ride any minute, omg!!! the brave bros i convinced to be my crew are looking to me for some aid but i got literally nothing to drop on 'em. there’s some mad apocalyptic susness in our vibe, yet my guts and hopes ain't bailing on me. but damn, even thinking that all these dudes’ lives are on the line cuz of my wild, mad schemes is totally terrifying; if we get wrecked, it’s all on my reckless brainchild, no cap!!!

and yo, margaret, how’s ur brain feelin? u won’t even peep any news of my total destruction and will be anxiously waiting for my epic comeback, for real. years will roll by, and u’ll get smacked with despair visits and still be tortured by a flicker of hope, omg!!! oh, my beloved sis, the gut-wrenching crash of your heartfelt hopes is, honestly, even more savage to me than my own death drop. but u got a hubby and these cute lil’ munchkins; maybe u can still grab a piece of happiness, fr!!! heaven bless n make u all lit!!!

my unlucky guest be hitting me with the softest, realest vibes, oozing tender compassion, trying to fill me with hope and chatterin’ like life is some prized swag he’s looting, deadass!!! he’s droppin reminders that the same crazy fails have hit other navigators on these savage seas, and even though i’m lowkey glitching, he fills me with bright auguries that seem too good to be true!!! even the sailor gang feels the force of his eloquent drip; when he speaks, despair takes a backseat and they get hyped up, believing these massive ice mountains are nothing but molehills that’ll yeet away when man flexes hard, yo!!! but these vibes are super fleeting; each extra day of waiting fills them with jittery fear, and i'm straight-up bracing for a mutiny triggered by this deep despair, omg!!!

september 5th.

a scene just went down so insane that even though these scribbles might never hit u, i absolutely gotta record every messy detail cuz it’s too epic to ghost, deadass!!!

we’re still trapped in this endless ice mountain surround, in major danger of being squished in some brutal ice clash, omg!!! the cold is extra savage, and like, many of my poor squad have already been snatched by this desolation grave scene, no cap!!! frankenstein’s health drops harder every day; his eyes still flicker with a feverish fire, but dude’s totally zapped, and if he even tries to vibe up for a sec, he instantly drops back into total zombie mode, smh!!!

i mentioned in my last note how the mutiny vibes were lurking. this morning, as i was chillin' and peeping my friend’s wan, half-asleep mug with his limbs just darelling like a failed download, i got mad woken up by like half a dozen sailors stormin’ in, demanding to crash into the cabin, omg!!! they yeeted inside, and their head honcho started flexin at me, saying he and his crew were handpicked by the rest of the sailor fam to drop a request on me that, in all fairness, i couldn’t refuse, deadass!!! we were totally hemmed in by ice and probably never meant to bounce out, but they were shook that if the ice melted and a free path opened, i'd be all impulsive and drag 'em into fresh gnarly dangers, even after they might’ve already smashed this hurdle. they insisted, like, i must drop a solemn promise that if our vessel ever shakes off its icy cage, i'll immediately yeet our course southwards, pronto!!!

this wild speech had me all troubled!! i hadn’t even despaired or thought about bouncin’ if we got freed, but like, could i really say nah to this crazy demand? i froze mid-response when frankenstein, who had been all ghostly silent and low-energy at first, suddenly popped off; his eyes lit up like crazy leds, his cheeks flushin' with momentary fire, and he spun toward the squad and dropped, 

“what do u mean, bro? what u demand from your captain? are u so easily ditching your epic mission? did u not hype this whole ride as a glorious expedition? and why was it glorious? not cuz the sea was smooth like a chill southern vibe but cuz it was jam-packed with dangers and pure terror, where every new glitch in the matrix was a call to flex that tough-as-nails courage and epic heart, cuz death and chaos were all around and u were supposed to face them like a true boss!!! this was the ultimate, honor-bound quest! u were gonna be celebrated as the benefactors of ur whole species, your names drippin’ in respect as legends who stared down death for honor and the squad’s benefit!!! and now, yo, at the very first hint of danger or the tiniest epic trial of your nerve, u already flinch and settle for being remembered as dudes too weak to handle the cold and peril, like, poor souls who bailed to their comfy firesides!!! why even come this far and drag your captain into a total defeat just to prove y’all are mere cowards??? oh, be real men, or level up beyond mere men!!! be rock-solid in your mission and firm as legit granite!!! this ice isn’t built from the same hardcore stuff as your hearts—it’s mutable and can totally break if you try to act tough!!! don’t roll back to your fam with disgrace tattooed on your brows!!! bounce back as epic heroes who fought, conquered and never knew the shame of turning their backs on the enemy, bro!!!”

he dropped those words with a voice modulated to every wild mood, his eyes lit with epic dreams and warrior vibes so raw that these dudes couldn’t help but get shook, starin at each other in dumb awe, unable to spit a word, deadass!!! i then told them to bounce and seriously chill on that epic thought, that i wouldn’t drag 'em further north if they were all “nah, im out”, but i was hopin that with some deep reflection, their lost courage would bounce back, ya feel me?

they bounced out and i turned to my friend, only to see him sunk deep in languor, near lifeless in his total slow-mo state, like a major fail.

i got no clue how this whole saga is gonna end, but i’d straight-up rather yeet myself than return as a total shame-fueled loser with my mission left undone, true story!!! yet i fear this is gonna be my fate; these dudes, without that fire of glory and honor fuel, will never willingly ride out these brutal hardships, fr!!!

september 7th.

the die is cast; i lowkey agreed to bounce back if we aren't totally wrecked. so my epic hopes got crashed by pure coward vibes and mad indecision; i’m headin back with zero clout and mega disappointed, deadass!!! it takes way more philosophy than i got to stomach this raw injustice with chill patience, omg!!!

september 12th.

it’s a wrap; i’m headin back to england. i’ve lost my dreams of utility and epic glory; i’ve lost my bro, no cap. but imma try to break down this bitter, salty mess for u, my dear sis; and while i ride the wave back to england and to u, i swear i won’t let despair steal my vibe!!!

september 9th.

the ice started to move, and like thunder-level roars echoed from afar as the islands cracked and split in every freakin’ direction, omg!!! we were in the most imminent, deadly peril, but with no power to act, my main focus turned to my unlucky guest whose sickness soared until he was totally bed-locked, like, 24/7!!! the ice busted behind us, getting shoved hard northwards; a wild breeze popped off from the west, and by the 11th the passage to the south was wide open and fresh, yeet!!!

when the sailor gang peeped this and realized they were about to bounce back to their homeland, they erupted in a shout of epic, tumultuous joy that went on forever, loud af!!! frankenstein, who was dozing and catching zzz’s, woke up all confused and asked, “what’s up with all the noise?” and i was like, “they’re shoutin cuz they’re soon headin back to england, for reals!”

“so u really headin back then?”  
“dang, yes; i can’t front their demands. i can’t drag 'em into danger if they ain’t down, so i gotta bounce back, no cap.”

“do u if u wanna; but i ain’t—u can bail on your own mission, but mine’s hand-written by heaven, and i ain’t about to ghost that! i might be weak, but surely the spirit squad backing my vengeance will hook me up with enough strength, fr.” then he tried to spring from the bed but the hype was too much, and he crashed back and fainted, omg!!!

it took forever before he came back online, and i was lowkey convinced that life had totally dropped to level zero. eventually he blinked his eyes open; he was barely breathin and couldn’t even drop a word. the surgeon slid him a chill, composing draught and ordered us to leave him in total peace mode. meanwhile, he softly told me that my bro probably didn’t have many hours left to flex on this earth, deadass!!!

his sentence was pronounced, and i could only sit there, griefin and waiting like a sad hella muted stream. i sat by his bed, watching his closed-eyes vibe, thinking he was deep asleep; but then he weakly called me over in a feeble voice, makin’ me come close, and said, “alas! the strength i was counting on is totally dunzo; i feel like i’m gonna dip soon, and my enemy, my relentless persecutor, might still be kickin’. don’t think, walton, that in my final beats i’m still burnin’ with that crazy hatred or that fire for revenge i once dropped; i just feel justified in wantin’ my adversary to get yeeted for good. in these last days, i’ve been rewatchin’ my past moves, and honestly, i don’t see any major flaws. in a vibe of insane, wild-madness, i created a rational creature and was all in to ensure his happiness and well-being—to the max of my power. that was my duty, but there was an even bigger one: my duty to my own kind, because their happiness (or misery) was on a whole other scale. pushed by that heavy truth, i said no to creatin’ a sidekick for my first creature, and damn, i did right by not doin’ it. he turned out to be a monster of unmatched evil and selfishness, straight-up destroyin’ my friends; he went on a rampage demolishing beings who had delicate feels, pure joy, and deep wisdom; and i honestly have zero clue where this thirst for vengeance will ever stop. if he’s so wretched that he can’t even spare someone else from misery, he should totally dip and die. the mission to destroy him was mine, but i failed, big time. fueled by my own nasty, selfish impulses, i begged you to take on my unfinished grind, and i’m droppin’ that request again now, driven purely by reason and hardcore virtue, no cap!!!”

“but yo, i can’t have u ditch your country and your squad just to handle this; and now that u’re headin back to england, u’re probs never gonna even cross paths with him again. so, weigh all these wild vibes and balance what you think your duties are—I leave that on u; my brain’s already trippin’ with the nearness of death and all that jazz. i dare not push u to do what i think is right, cuz i might still be misled by some wild passion, fr.”

“it bugs me hardcore that he might live on as a tool of pure mischief; aside from that, this moment—when i almost think i’m gettin’ released—is the only lit moment i’ve had in years. the ghostly faces of my dearly departed drift before me, and i’m rushin’ to hug that memory; peace out, walton! chase chill vibes, find happiness in tranquility, and ditch ambition—even if it’s just that seemingly innocent flex of standing out in science and discoveries, deadass. but why am i even sayin’ this? i got totally roasted in these hopes myself, yet maybe someone else will be able to win that crown, fr.”

his voice started gettin’ super faint as he rambled, and before long, totally exhausted by the wild effort, he sank into deep silence. like half an hour later, he tried to drop another word, but his voice just totally failed him; he weakly squeezed my hand and his eyes just closed forever, while a tender, soft smile melted away from his lips, like a once-hot meme finally expired, omg!!!

margaret, what even can i say about the untimely yeet of this glorious spirit? what words could even scratch the surface of my deep, beastly sorrow??? all i spill would be totally lame and half-weak, i swear!!! my tears be flowin like a busted fountain; my brain’s buried under a cloud of mega disappointment, no cap!!! but i’m headin back to england, hoping somewhere there i might catch a shred of consolation, fr!!!

i’m getting interrupted—what do these wild sounds mean??? it’s midnight, the breeze is chillin’ right, and the deck watch barely moves, deadass!!! then i catch a rough, gruff human voice coming from the cabin where frankenstein’s busted remains still lie. i gotta bounce up and check it out, yo!!! good night, my sis!!!

oh my gawd!!! what a mind-blowing scene just unfolded!!! i’m still dizzy and shook from the remembrance, not even sure if i got the power to spill all the deets; but trust, the tale i’m droppin is totally incomplete without this final, insane, and wonderful catastrophe, omg!!!

i rolled into the cabin where my ill-fated yet legendary bro lay, deadass!!! hanging over him was a form i can barely even describe—it was gigantic AF but straight-up twisted and grossly off in its proportions, like some glitchy nightmare, omg!!! as this hideous form hung over the coffin, its face was hidden behind a mess of ragged, wild hair; but one ginormous hand was stretched out, lookin’ all mummy-like in color and texture, for real!!!

when it caught the sound of my approach, it clammed up on all the grief and horror shouts and straight-up yeeted toward the window, like, urgent AF!!! i’ve never seen a face so horrifically off—a look so rotten and hideously twisted that i involuntarily slammed my eyes shut and scrambled to remember what legit duty i owed to this total destroyer! i called out, “yo, stay!” like, desperately!!!

it paused, starin’ at me all curious and wide-eyed, then turned back to the lifeless shell of its creator like it totally forgot i was even there; every twitch and movement was pure, unfiltered, wild rage from some uncontrollable passion, omg!!!

“yo, that’s my victim too!” it hollered, high on rage, “with his murder, my entire crime saga is sealed up—my disastrous series is finally done!!! oh, frankenstein! you were once this generous, self-devoted legend! so wtf does it matter if i now beg for forgiveness? i, who completely yeeted you by destroying every shred of what you loved, damn it!!! alas! he’s cold now, he can’t even answer these broken pleas.”

its voice was muffled and strangled, and my first instinct—like, to totally honor my dying bro’s request to obliterate his enemy—got frozen mid-moment by a mashup of wild curiosity and soft compassion. i crept closer to this towering, monstrous being; i couldn’t even dare lift my eyes to its face ‘cause it was that scary and otherworldly ugly, like a horror meme come to life, omg!!! i tried to speak, but every word just died on my lips, glitching out hard!!! the monster kept babbling wild, scattered self-roasts in a frenzy of incoherence until i finally mustered up the guts to break through the storm of its passion and drop some words:

“yo, your sorry act is now totally extra and unnecessary. if u’d listened to that inner conscience beep and felt the sting of remorse before droppin’ your diabolical vengeance to this extreme, frankenstein would still be brewin’ in the game, for real.”

“and u wildin’ or what?” the dæmon snapped back. “u think i was then completely dead to agony and remorse? look here—” he jabbed his shaky finger at the corpse “—he didn’t even suffer when the deed went down. oh boy, not even a ten-thousandth fraction of the torment i endured during that slow-mo execution saga!!! some hella selfish vibe rushed me on while my heart got totally poisoned with regret. u think clerval’s groans were like sweet music to my ears? my heart was built to catch love and all that warm fuzzy vibe, and when misery dragged it into vice and hatred, it couldn’t handle that savage change without torturing me in ways u wouldn’t even fathom, deadass.”

...

after the murder of clerval i bounced back to switzerland, heart shattered like a broken smartphone screen omg, i was lowkey heartbroken and totally overwhelmed, deadass i pitied frankenstein so hard—my pity flipped into full-on horror mode and i straight up hated myself, like no cap!!! but then, get this, i peeped that he, the original creator of my whole wack existence and that unspeakable torment remix, had the audacity to hope for some happiness while stacking up misery on me like a dumpster fire, and here he was out here snatching up his own fun feels and passions like free loot, from which i was permanently banned, so my envy went full impotent and bitter indignation exploded into a thirst for savage vengeance, k? i recalled my threat from way back and resolved to yeet it into action, even though i knew i was signing up for a deadly torture sesh—i was just a puppet, a slave to an impulse i despised but could never ghost, deadass!!! then, yo, when she dipped and died, suddenly i wasn’t miserable at all, i straight up dumped every single feel, subdued all that anguish, and went off on a riotous binge of despair that was extra af, and evil became my ultimate vibe then, no cap, so forced by the drama, i had to morph my nature to flex on an element i chose like a gigachad, and the finish of my demoniac plan became this insatiable, lit passion. and now, boom, it’s done, there lies my final victim, period!!!

yo so at first i was all touched by his miserable drip, feeling his emo vibes and stuff, but then i recalled frankenstein flexing about his smooth eloquence and sick persuasion skills, and when i peeped my friend’s lifeless form again, pure indignation got recharged in me like a battery on hyper, fam. i was like, "wretch!" and then dropped a savage diss: "it’s perf that u roll up here to whine about the wasteland u crafted—u toss a torch into a stack of buildings and, when they’re totally roasted, u sit in the ruins crying over the burn, lmao hypocritical fiend! if the dude u mourn was still vibin’, he’d be the target, like straight up the prey for your cursed revenge, deadass. it ain’t pity u feel; u just moan 'cause the victim of your malicious vibes got snatched from your clutches, smh."

"oh, not like that—not like that," the being cut in, voice all chaotic and glitchy, "but yo, that’s apparently the vibe u been catchin’ from what looks like the whole deep message of my actions, deadass. i ain’t lookin’ for a ride-or-die partner in misery—no sympathy squad for me, i swear. back when i first chased that vibe, it was all about the love of virtue, overflowing with happy feels and mad affection that i wanted to share, but now that virtue’s just a ghost shadow and all that happiness got flipped into bitter despair and loathing, so what am i even supposed to lean on for sympathy? i’m cool suffering solo while my pain just rages on; when i clock out for good, i’m down knowing that pure abhorrence and opprobrium will tag my legacy hard. i used to vibe on dreams of virtue, fame, and lit enjoyment—once i even lowkey hoped to link up with peeps who’d pardon my rough exterior and love me for the dope qualities i could drop, fed by high honor and devotion vibes—but now crime done degraded me to below the lowest animal level. no guilt, no mischief, no extra malignity or misery even comes close to mine; scrolling through my brutal sin playlist, i can’t even believe i’m still the same creature whose mind was once lit with sublime, transcendent visions of beauty and god-tier goodness. deadass, the fallen angel straight-up morphs into a malignant devil, and even that enemy of god and man had some crew in his loneliness; now, bro, i’m all alone, solo mode activated.

yo you, who be calling frankenstein your friend, thinkin’ you got the 411 on my cray-cray crimes and his misfortunes, listen up: even all the deets he spilled couldn’t sum up the endless hours and months i wasted drowning in impotent, salty passions, no cap. like, while i demolished his hopes, my own desires stayed on max crave mode—always burning, always hungry for love and squad vibes, yet i got straight up spurned. is that even fair, fam? am i supposed to be labeled the only criminal when the entire human squad sinned against me? why ain’t u throwing that hate at felix, who booted his friend out with extra contumely, and why aren’t u dissing that rustic who tried to wreck the savior of his kid? nah, these dudes are supposed to be virtuous and pristine, but here i am—the miserable, the abandoned—a total aborted vibe, destined to be snubbed, kicked, and trampled on, deadass! even now, my blood’s boilin’ just rememberin’ that savage injustice, omg, so extra!

real talk, it’s true that i’m a total wretch, no cap. i done murdered those who were lovely and helpless; i straight-up strangled the innocent in their sleep and choked a dude to death who never dished me or any other soul any harm, deadass! i even turned my creator, that prime specimen of all things worthy of love and mad admiration among men, into a walking misery meme; chased him down even to that unfixable ruin, and now he’s just lyin’ there, white and cold in death, like an expired snapshot. u hate me, but u abhor me not as hard as i despise myself, like for real. i stare at the hands that pulled off the deed and think on the heart that sparked that insane idea, just buzzin’ for the moment when those hands lock with my eyes and that twisted imagination stops ghosting my thoughts forever, omg!

yo, no cap, don’t trip about me being the tool for future chaos—my work’s nearly peaked, fam. it ain’t about your death or any random dude’s exit to seal the saga of my existence and finish what must be done, but it calls for my own demise, deadass! don’t think im slow on this sacrifice hustle: imma ditch your vessel on that ice raft which dropped me here and bounce off to the farthest, most northern end of the globe, legit. imma scoop up my funeral pile and torch this miserable frame straight to ashes, so no nosy, unholy wretch can spark a remake of me, ever, k? i’m gonna die, and then no more agonizing feels or unsatisfied, unquenched vibes will be my ride—he who spawned me is dead, and once i check out, the memory of us both will vanish faster than a viral meme, bruh. i won’t catch the sun, stars, or even feel the wind on my cheeks again—like, light, feelz, and sense will all ghost out; and in this empty void, i gotta find my own weird form of happiness, i guess. a few years back, when the world first dropped dope images on me, when i felt that summer hype and heard leaves rustlin’ and birds warblin’—all that was mine—i’d have legit cried to the point of dying; now, it’s my only consolation, deadass, polluted by crimes and ripped apart by bitter remorse, where else to get chill except in death, yo?

farewell! i peaced out on y’all, and in you lies the last of humankind these eyes will ever peep, deadass. farewell, frankenstein! if u were still kickin’ it and still had that savage itch for revenge against me, it'd be way more lit if that craving got its fix in my lifetime rather than after my total destruction, no cap. but nah, u went for my total extinction so i wouldn’t cause even more epic wretchedness; and if, by some mystery unknown to me, u hadn’t stopped thinkin’ and feelin’, u wouldn’t be cravin’ a vengeance bigger than mine, deadass. blasted as u are, my agony still towers over yours, coz the bitter sting of remorse is gonna keep gnawing at my wounds until death seals them for good, period.

"but soon," he bawled with that heavy, sad, solemn hype, "i’m gonna die, and all the feels i got now will vanish, ghosted for life. soon these burnin’ miseries are gonna dip out, extinct like a canceled trend. imma climb my funeral pile in full triumph, exultin’ in the savage agony of torturin’ flames, yo. the light of that wild conflagration will fade out; my ashes will get swept off into the sea by crazy winds, and my spirit? it’ll snooze in peace, or if it even thinks, it won’t exactly think like that, deadass. farewell."

then he yeeted himself out the cabin-window as he dropped that line, ridin’ an ice raft snug next to the vessel, and real quick, the waves yeeted him away into complete darkness and endless distance like a lost modem in the void, omg!
