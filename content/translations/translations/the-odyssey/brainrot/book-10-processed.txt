aeolus’s hood we touched down next, the island afloat behind savage bronze walls,
bro’s name was aeolus, hype-man to the gods, a local hero who had that cosmic wind-control vibe:
he had twelve kiddos, six grooms, six brides, big happy fam, feasting on the daily,
the courtyard reeking of roast and smoke, nights spent in plush bedding, no stress, no cap.

dude welcomed me for a whole month, bugging me for war stories—
all about troy, our nostaic agony, the secrets of greek tears, i spilled the tea in full detail.
then i was like, “bestie, we gotta bounce, can you help me secure that quick route home?”
he said bet, gave me a special bag, stuffed with rowdy winds like the ultimate cheat code.

he sealed that bag tight so no stray breeze would troll me,
left only zephyr pushing my ship along sweetly.
i was big careful, manning the helm sleepless, so my crew wouldn’t do anything braindead.
on the tenth day, we finally glimpsed our homeland’s fires—i could practically taste ithaca, for real.

but i was dead exhausted, so i dozed off, trusting the squad. big mistake.
these clown-tier homies, consumed by envy and the rumor the bag held gold,
were like “dang, our man’s hoarding mad loot. let’s open that glizzy, see if we can dip into the coin.”
they popped it, and *boom*, every savage wind roared out, swirl city, the sea went feral,

tossed us back so far, we ended up at aeolus’s place again. i woke in pure meltdown mode,
wondering if i should jump ship and join poseidon. but i just held the L quietly.
we moored on the shore, re-did dinner. then i took a hype-man and herald to see aeolus,
but as soon as he saw me rolling in, he sussed that the gods were done with me.

“nah,” he said, “get out. you’re obviously canceled by olympus if you messed up that badly.”
he slammed the door on my meltdown, so we left, heartbreak heavy in our chests,
pulling those oars till our arms felt glitchy, no freebies left, no more freebies from wind-lord.
six days, six nights we rowed, dragging ourselves across the deep,

till day seven brought us to laestrygonian land, telepylus, city perched so high,
where a weird phenomenon: the herder rolling in meets another heading out,
meaning day and night be next-door neighbors. no one ever sleeps, wack vibes.
we eased into the harbor, ringed by epic cliffs, a narrow mouth,

my whole fleet moored inside, snug like baby chicks—no waves there, glassy stillness.
but i, the paranoid goat, kept my black ship outside, roped up against the rocky edge,
climbed to a vantage point. saw zero farmland hustle, only a curling smoke pillar.
i picked a few to scout the local vibe; they found a girl fetching water near some stream,

turns out she’s the daughter of the local king, antiphates. she pointed them to her pops’ crib,
and man, soon as they arrived, the queen was taller than the highest peak, monstrous aura,
and big papa antiphates seized one man as a snack. the rest sprinted back,
the king let out a massive war cry, summoning laestrygonians—these homies built like giants,

they started chunking huge rocks from the cliffs, turned my men into crunchy fish bait.
the harbor filled with doom: smashed ships, devoured sailors. i whipped out my sword,
chopped my moorings, screamed at my day-ones to row or get rekt. we escaped by a hair,
only my ship surviving, the rest ghosted by these gargantuan cannibals.

we rowed on, mourning the lost, until we reached circe’s isle, aeaea,
home of that dread goddess with luscious hair, circe, sister to cruel aeetes,
both kids of helios’s blazing lines, born to persa the ocean’s daughter.
we beached in a hush, hearts hammered from meltdown to meltdown,

two days two nights we just lay on the sand, trauma-laden. on day three, i grabbed my spear and sword,
hiked for a vantage, scoping for mortal works or maybe some sign of life.
there i saw a slim column of smoke rising from deep in the woods, so i thought,
“lemme go back, feed the squad, then peep what’s up.”

on my way to the ship, the gods hooking me up, i lucked upon a giant stag by a stream,
thirsty in the midday heat. i skewered him between the shoulders,
the spear shooting through so violently he dropped on the spot. i roped its limbs,
dragged it back—dude was huge, i almost needed forklift rizz to lug him.

dumped him by the hull, woke my men from their slump, said, “hey, we’re not dead yet, besties.
let’s eat, get some bread and prime protein in us, level up before the next fiasco.”
everyone vibed with the idea, and we made a massive feast, the smoky smell swirling,
feasting all day till dusk, then dozing on the beach with full bellies.

dawn came rosy again, so i assembled the crew, said, “y’all, we lost track of all directions,
we only know this island’s out here, ringed by unknown waters. i saw smoke deep inside,
it’s a big domain, we gotta be strategic. no meltdown, though we remember the cyclops fiasco.
crying won’t fix it, so let’s do squads.”

i split them into two, me leading one, eurylokhos the other, we drew straws,
his got pulled, so he took twenty-two weeping dudes to recon.
they found circe’s polished stone house in a clearing, savage wolves and lions swaying around,
they used to be men, but the mistress’s potions had them acting docile, wagging tails like puppies.

my men heard circe singing inside as she worked the loom, voice sweet as honey.
polites, my bro, said, “someone’s weaving in there, singing. goddess or lady, let’s hail.”
they called out, she popped open the shining doors and invited them in. big lulz,
all marched inside except eurylokhos (sus boy), who guessed the trap.

she fed them cheese, barley, honey wine spiked with vile potions that wiped their memory.
then flick—she turned them to pigs, penned them in, but their human minds remained intact.
eurylokhos sprinted back in tears, stammering the tragedy. i seized my gear, told him to guide me.
he begged me not to go, but i was locked in: gotta rescue my squad, no half-sends.

i left. out of nowhere, hermes, the gold-wanded messenger, rolled up disguised as a young man,
he’s like, “chief, you about to waltz into circe’s lair? watch out, or you’ll end up pigged too.
take this magic plant (they call it moly). it’s o-p. her potions won’t harm you if you got this.
when she tries to smite you with her wand, brandish your sword, scare her. she’ll want that fling,

but force her to vow not to scuff you further. then and only then, you can get your homies freed.”
hermes vanished; i pressed on, heart pounding. circe welcomed me, gave me spiked wine,
but thanks to moly, i was unphased. she tapped me with the wand, told me, “off to the sty, piggy.”
i whipped out my blade, so she freaked, knelt, and asked me who i was.

realizing i was the fabled odysseus hermes had foretold, she wanted to hook up. i was like, “hold up—
you turned my homies to swine, you want me in your bed so you can sabotage me further?
nah, vow by the gods you won’t do me dirty.” she swore it. i gave in.
her maids set everything up: the warm bath, fresh clothes. she tried to feed me but i was depressed,

thinking about my men. she said, “why so sad?” i told her i couldn’t eat if my day-ones were hogged.
she caved, let them out, anointing them with an antidote so their hair and form returned,
turning them younger and hotter than before. they recognized me and bawled, hugging.
circe empathized, told me, “go get the rest, bring ‘em all to me, stash your ship, let’s vibe.”

so i returned to the beach, found my guys weeping like calves for their mamas,
they thought i’d died, but i said, “roll up, everything’s gucci, we can feast at circe’s place.
the food is top-tier, no more starving. let’s go.” but eurylokhos tried to hold them back,
accusing me of leading them into cyclops-tier trouble. i wanted to decap him on the spot,

but the crew calmed me. we all ended up at circe’s mansion, and sure enough, she hosted us sweetly,
turned the pig-boys back to men, gave them new clothes, and we feasted, partied for a whole year,
lowkey forgot about the concept of going home. but eventually, they were like, “bro, can we bounce??”
i took the hint, asked circe to keep her promise to let us dip.

she said, “fine, but you gotta do one more bizarre side quest first:
head to hades’s realm to consult the shade of teiresias, the blind seer who can guide your route.
that’s the only way.” i was shook, sobbing on her bed. “no living mortal sails there,” i said.
she told me exactly how: catch the winds, sail to the edge of ocean’s gloom, find the crossing streams,

dig a pit, pour out libations for the dead (milk, wine, water, scatter barley), vow you’ll sacrifice a heifer
once you’re safe home, plus a black ram specifically for teiresias. then guard the blood offering
till the ghostly prophet arrives to speak your fate.”
next morning, she dressed gorgeously in shining robes, i rallied my men,

though no route from this mistress would come free of pain. but fate was set.
one of my crew, elpenor, the youngest, not so bright, woke up hammered, dozed on circe’s roof.
he fell off the ladder, snapped his neck. big rip.
we only realized after we had boarded, mourning that new random casualty.

i dropped the bomb about the new side quest: “uh, sorry, we gotta descend to hades next.”
everyone meltdown, more tears, but no choice. we marched to the black ship, weeping anew.
as we boarded, circe pulled a quick cameo: tethered a ram and a black ewe by the ship,
slipped away unseen, goddess moves. so we set ourselves for the trip beyond mortal ken.

that’s how book 10 hits, deadass.
