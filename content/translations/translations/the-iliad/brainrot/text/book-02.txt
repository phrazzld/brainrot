muse, drop the deets: all gods and horse-helmed heroes
were deep in snooze, but not big daddy zeus—no sweet dreams for him:
he was pressed, tbh, on how to level up swift-footed achilles
and slam the achaean navy with savage heartbreak.
deep in the swirl of his almighty mind, a plan rose to the top:
send a lethal dream to atreid agamemnon—
fake him out so he’d rally the lush-haired achaeans,
thinking the day had come to clap troy’s wide streets.

so zeus called out to dream: “yo, cursed vision, hustle down
to the black-hulled warships, slip inside agamemnon’s crib.
show up looking like old-man nestor—trusted vibe—and say,
‘dude, arm the squad, net yourself troy, for real.
no more drama with the gods, hera’s swayed them all;
trojans are cooked, better hold on tight to this prophecy.’”

dream took off in a blur, soared across the star-flecked dark,
down to the ships of the bronze-shirt achaeans.
he found the king in deep drool, ringed with silky slumber.
posing as nestor, the dream hovered overhead, whispering:
“you doze, atreus’s son, but come on, you rule all these squads;
shouldn’t you be up crafting next moves for glory?
listen up: i’m a messenger from zeus who feels your hustle—
he says to gather your curly-haired fighters
and power-walk into troy now.
the gods are done with being split, the trojans are cursed,
so snag that city.
don’t let am sleep hush your memory—
when morning glows, do the thing.”

with that, dream dipped, leaving the king swirling in hype.
agamemnon woke, cloak swirling around his shoulders,
he strapped on glistening sandals, belted that silver-studded sword,
gripped the father’s scepter—legend, unbreakable.
rosy-fingered dawn rose, all pastel and subtle flex,
while zeus’s heralds scurried across camp, shrilling the war-call:
“roll out, luscious-haired achaeans, gather near the king!”

war-lords assembled near nestor’s ship;
agamemnon spilled the tea on his midnight cameo:
“friends, i saw a savage dream with nestor’s face, no joke,
telling me to muster all squads—zeus has sealed our quick dub.
but i’ll test the rank-and-file first, telling them to bounce,
then watch you hold them back with boss-tier pep talks.”
nestor nodded, “bet—lines are drawn. let’s hype them.”

they left that counsel, each king with scepter in hand,
and the loud-voiced heralds roamed, hollering for assembly.
the crowd thronged like bees, just wild, from the huts and the ships,
flooding the shore until the dusty earth moaned beneath them.
when they locked in place, the entire scene roared
like waves hammered by eurus and notus across the sea.

agamemnon rose tall with that shining scepter from father to son:
“zeus got me messed up, folks. we’ve lingered nine years,
ships rotting, ropes frayed, while troy still stands.
maybe we cut losses, sail home. the trojans got infinite backups.”
the mass broke, a swirl of panic as they sprinted for the boats,
kicking up sand, howling “we’re out.”

but grey-eyed athena saw that nonsense and spat,
“hera’s bestie can’t let you go all meltdown.”
she zoomed down from olympus, found odysseus the sly,
grabbed his heart with fierce words: “are you seriously bailing?
dude, this war has a vow: troy must fall for helen’s drama.
stand up, shatter their coward talk!”
odysseus flung off his cloak, snatched agamemnon’s staff,
sprinted across the lines, coaxing or cursing men:
when he met a noble, it was “sit tight, we got this,
king’s only messing, you know the vibe.”
if some rando barked, he whacked them with the staff,
growling, “zip it, peon. we can’t all be top-tier,
one boss is enough—fall in line.”

then some clown named thersites flung hot insults
at the shepherd of men, tore into him about hogging gold,
snatching prize girls, and trashing achilles.
odysseus wasn’t having it, turned, shot him a death glare:
“thersites, you’re built like a donkey’s behind. hush or i’ll strip you bare
and drag your butt sobbing from the assembly.”
one staff-crack to his back—blood welled, tears fell,
the crowd snorted laughter though pity brushed them, too.

odysseus stood bright with the staff, spitting truth:
“agm, big homie, the mass almost folded. now let’s be real:
calchas told us troy’s ours in the tenth year, so hold up—
no more ditch talk. we’ve put in too much sweat.”
the crowd soared in a thunderous whoop, wave after wave.
nestor came in with that timeless grandpa voice:
“indeed, kids, we made pacts. no backing out.
agm, keep your nerve. the father of gods promised
lightning-bolt confirmation. the walls will crumble.”

agamemnon sighed: “nobody wants it more than me.
but zeus keeps me in drama with swift-footed achilles—
whatever, let’s strap up. feed the horses, sharpen the bronze,
we go full tilt all day. if i see some clown by the ships,
birds and dogs’ll munch him—no mercy.”
the host roared so loud the sea’s edge rattled;
then they scattered, lit fires, and made offerings to the gods.
the king butchered a fat bull for zeus, prayed to wreck priam’s throne,
to slash open hector’s war-tunic with bright bronze.
zeus took the roast but stoked bigger woes in secret.

once they feasted, nestor again pressed, “make haste.
let the heralds rally the curly-haired fighters—
we gotta ride. day’s burnin’.”
agamemnon complied, sent them out.
through the swirling crowd, grey-eyed athena soared,
her ageless aegis shimmering with golden tassels,
sparking war-lust in each heart so fierce
they forgot all thoughts of home—only rage for troy.
like a hungry blaze ripping mountain timber,
their armor gleamed from miles away,
chariots rumbled, hooves kicked dust, and men thronged
like flocks of birds swirling over spring fields.
the ground groaned under that epic stampede.

muse, who was the top dog among the achaeans,
and which swift mares reigned in horsepower?
eumelus’s pair were goats, reared by apollo,
fast as winged shadows, unstoppable.
and among men, giant ajax stood prime
since swift-footed achilles chilled in his tent,
still fuming over the stolen bride.
that’s how the achaeans stormed out, like unstoppable wildfire,
the earth quaking under their hungry stride.

meanwhile, wind-foot iris zapped down from olympus,
finding the trojans gathered at priam’s gates,
all chitchatting like they had infinite time.
iris, in a friend’s shape, hissed: “hector, the achaeans
are rolling like waves or sand grains, huge.
you better muster your squads, each warlord over his own.
all tongues swirl in troy with so many foreign crew,
so keep it organized.”

hector, of the shining helm, dismissed the assembly.
the trojan gates flung wide, men poured out on foot and horse,
thundering like stormclouds.
they spread across the plain near that hill they call bateia—
the immortals call it myrine’s tomb.
there the trojans and all their allies sorted into lines.
hector led the trojans, blazing in bronze,
aeneas the dardanians, son of aphrodite.
pandarus from zeliea, with apollo’s sacred bow.
adrestus and amphius marched from adresteia,
but merops, their wise dad, had tried to hold them back—
destiny would not be swerved.
then asius from percote, unstoppable behind big bay horses.
hippothous, leading the pelasgians, badass with spears.
from thrace, acamas and peiros by the hurling hellespont.
paeonians from amydon with crooked bows.
paphlagonians under hairy-chested pylaimenes,
halizones from silver-laced alybe,
mysians led by chromis and ennomus the bird prophet (who’d still get smoked
by unstoppable achilles).
phrygians under phorcys and ascanios,
maeonians from under mount tmolus,
carians who spoke wild tongues under amphimachus and nastes (the clown
who wore gold to war, smh, got murked anyway).
last came the lycians, repped by lord sarpedon and glorious glaucus,
stepping from the swirling xanthus, eager to clash.

like that, the battle lines stood, each side fired up,
war’s jaws wide open, waiting for the first blow.
