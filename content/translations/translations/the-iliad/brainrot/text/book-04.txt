yooo, lemme set the scene:

the gods all posted up around zeus,
chilling on his bougie gold floor.
queen hibeh’s bartending, pouring nectar nonstop,
and they’re passing around golden cups,
eyes locked on the trojan city below.

straight up, zeus is feeling petty,
poking at hera with snarky jabs, like:
“dang, menelaus’s got hera and athena on speed-dial,
but they’re just out here side-eyeing the war.
meanwhile aphrodite’s glomming onto paris,
always saving that dude from certain doom.
menelaus took the w already, but what’s next?
should we let these folks call it a day,
or do we hype them back into chaos?
maybe priam’s town can chill in peace,
and menelaus can haul helen back to argos?
which vibe do we pick?”

athena just quietly seethes,
but hera can’t hold it in—she goes:
“zeus, bruh, are you serious right now?
you wanna toss all my hard work and sweaty horse-labor,
like it’s worthless? i basically orchestrated
these achaean squads to ruin priam & fam.
if you wanna cut them slack, do it,
but none of the other gods are about that life.”

cloudlord zeus sighs big:
“woman, what’s your beef with priam?
dang, you’d eat him raw if you could.
fine, go crush troy if it pacifies your rage,
but next time i wanna flatten a city you love,
don’t come whining to me.
remember, i’m letting you do this—grudgingly.
just don’t block me later. got it?”

hera nods, all:
“cool, i can vibe with that.
but you gotta call athena, get her down there.
tell her to push trojans into snapping first,
to break the truce, so the war restarts.”

zeus shrugs: “deal.”
he signals athena: “zip down to the battlefield,
make the trojans fling that first punch.”

like a blazing meteor, pallas plunges from olympus,
hits the ground in front of both armies—
everyone’s like “woah, wtf cosmic cameo.”
some trojan’s whispering: “maybe we’re about to brawl again,
or maybe zeus is hooking us up with a peace deal.”
spoiler: it’s war.

athena shape-shifts into a trojan rando,
slides up to pandarus—lycaon’s fearsome kid.
she’s all: “dude, you see menelaus flexing over there?
you should totally shoot him.
paris’ll shower you with dope gifts if you ice that guy.
tbh, you’ll be a trojan legend.
pray to apollo, promise him a sick sacrifice
once you get home. just send that arrow.”

pandarus is like, “bet,”
whips out his fancy goat-horn bow,
nocks a nasty arrow, prays real quick,
and lets it rip at menelaus.

but pallas has menelaus’s back.
she flicks the arrow so it barely grazes him,
just enough to spill a little blood.
agamemnon sees that drip and nearly faints:
“bro, they broke the pact. trojans are scummy.
zeus might not smite ’em today,
but i swear, troy’s going down eventually.
if you die, menelaus, i’m big done. i’ll never live it down.”

menelaus soothes him: “relax, i’m good,
it only nicked me, belt took most of the hit.
call the doc, though. i don’t wanna risk it.”

agamemnon hollers for machaon,
the healer kid of asclepius:
“come patch my bro, an arrow’s in his side!”

machaon checks it out, yanks the arrow free,
cleans the wound, applies chiron’s dope herbs.
menelaus is stable, but tension’s lit—
the trojans gear up again, shield walls forming,
achaens doing the same,
no more chill, just war-lust swirling.

meanwhile, king ag is rushing around,
cheering the bold, roasting the lazy:
“hey, argives, don’t slack. we got father zeus on our side,
’cause the trojans dissed the oath.
their corpses about to feed vultures,
and we’re taking their wives and kids as we bounce—
so hustle up.”

if he sees anyone holding back,
he’s all: “you wimpy clowns, you want the trojans to hit our ships?
be real, push forward.”

then he swings by idomeneus and the cretans,
sees them locked in like a boss formation,
salutes them: “this is the hype i need,”
and they’re basically ready to rock.

next, the ajaxes are front-lining,
like a huge storm cloud rolling in off the sea,
ominous and unstoppable.
agamemnon’s all hearts-in-his-eyes:
“man, if everyone had your vibe,
we’d dust priam’s city in no time.”

he also peeps nestor, wise boomer of pylos,
arranging chariots up front, infantry behind,
and sticking the lame fighters in the middle
so they can’t ditch the war.
agamemnon’s like: “dang, if only your knees were as strong as your brain, grandpa,
you’d solo them.”
nestor’s all: “eh, father time spares no one, but i can still direct folks,
that’s the elder’s prerogative. let the younger bros do the stabbing.”

agamemnon keeps rolling on, sees menestheus of athens and sly odysseus with the cephalonians,
maybe dragging their feet a bit. he roasts them, but odysseus snaps back:
“hey, watch your mouth, we’re not bailing—
you’ll see me in the thick, i promise.”
agamemnon’s like, “my bad, let’s forget i said that.”

then he spots diomedes hanging with his boy sthenelus.
he’s like, “man, your dad tydeus was braver, always front-lining.
why you chilling at the edges?”
sthenelus is offended, tries to clap back,
but diomedes is like, “chill, let’s not clap at the king.
we got bigger fish to fry. let’s go.”

diomedes leaps from his chariot in full gear,
the metal clanking loud enough to spook anyone.
the entire achaean line marches in unison,
silent but deadly—
the trojans, though, they’re yelling like a thousand goats bleating at once,
since they’re from all over creation.
ares is fueling them, athena is fueling the greeks,
frenzy intensifies, the middle ground between the armies is about to blow.

once they clash, it’s swords on shields,
cries of men killing and dying.
the earth runs red with gore.
it’s like two raging rivers colliding in a mountain gorge,
shepherds hearing the thunder from miles away—
that’s how savage it is.

antilochus draws first blood, dropping echepolus,
elephenor tries to strip the corpse but gets speared by agenor—
boom, two gone, fight rages around them like wolves tearing at each other.

ajax nails simoisius, a young trojan who never even got to pay back his parents for raising him—
rough.
antiphus tries to chuck a spear at ajax but misses,
killing leucus, odysseus’s pal, and odysseus goes ballistic,
hurling a javelin that kills democoön, priam’s illegit son.
the trojans pull back, hector included,
while the greeks roar forward, dragging away bodies.
apollo’s watching from pergamus, raging at the trojans:
“push back, you horse-tamers, don’t wimp out!
these greeks ain’t made of stone or steel,
and achilles ain’t even fighting right now.”

athena, for her part, scours the ranks,
egging on the achaean squads,
and fate soon catches diōres, who’s hammered by a tossed rock at the shin,
then finished off.
his killer, peiros, gets taken out by thoas,
but then thoas can’t strip the armor,
’cause peiros’s thracian homies shove him away.
both leaders lie dead, trojan and greek,
with plenty more bodies piling around them.

any bystander rolling up now?
they’d be terrified, but pallas athena guides the bold,
turning away spears from her chosen heroes.
the day’s violence is unstoppable:
troy and achaea smashing each other,
blood soaking the ground, men dropping left and right,
like it’s the gnarliest day in forever.
