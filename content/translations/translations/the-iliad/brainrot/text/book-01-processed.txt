yap to me, muse, ‘bout achilles’ meltdown, that savage meltdown that dropped big l’s on the achaian squad,
sending loads of prime heroes down to hades, leaving their bods as a snack for stray doggos and all the feral birds—
like legit feeding the crows—while zeus was vibing with that plan.
the drama kicked off when that big boss, lord atreides, and the god-tier runner achilles first started throwing shade,
and some petty deity basically said, “bet, i’m finna let these dudes beef.”

turns out it was apollo, the real golden-bow main from zeus and leto,
who got pissed at lord agamemnon for disrespecting apollo’s priest, chrysēs,
that sweet old man who rolled up to the swift achaian ships,
flashin’ mad ransom for his daughter—she was a baddie no cap—and rocking apollo’s holy drip,
gold all over his staff, big aura screaming, “i come in peace, besties, accept my gift and unhand my baby girl.”

everyone else was like, “we should vibe with the old priest, get the bag and not be cringe,”
but noooo, king agamemnon was extra salty and told the old man to crash out,
threatening, “don’t let me catch you lurking around these ships again, old-timer, or i’ll do you dirty.”
chrysēs dips out, cursing them under his breath, and begs apollo with the silver bow,
that savage plague-lord, to smite the achaian squad.

apollo’s like, “say less,” leaps down from olympus, bow at the ready, arrows making that eardrum-shattering clang,
and he drops a gnarly plague on the men, so quick they’re dying in droves.
nine days straight the pyres keep burning with the bodies, and on day ten, swift achilles calls a meeting,
cuz white-armed hera put a bug in his ear—she was big sad seeing her fave achaian bros dropping like flies.

achilles stands up in the gathering:
“this is big yikes, homies. war kills us on one side, plague kills us on the other. we gotta see what’s up.
maybe we can ask a prophet or get in an oracle’s dms, see why apollo’s so pressed.
did we skip out on some fire sacrifice? did we ghost him on some vow? let’s find the tea, so maybe we can fix it.”

then this seer named kalchas, top-tier omen-reader, stands up:
he’s the best in the bird-checking game, leading the ships to troy by apollo’s intel,
and he says, “achilles, you want me to spill? gotta promise you’ll protect me, bestie, cuz the king might pop off.”
and achilles is all, “bro, you have my word, no cap. i’ll tank any heat, even if it’s from the biggest big shot around.”

kalchas goes, “apollo’s not mad about missed prayers or meager hecatombs. it’s about that disrespect for chrysēs.
agamemnon wouldn’t release the priest’s daughter or take the ransom.
that’s why apollo is all savage mode on us. we gotta give that girl back, no questions, no price tag, plus a fresh offering if we want the plague to chill.”

straight up, the seer sits, and king agamemnon flips out:
he glares and rants at kalchas: “prophet of doom, you never say anything gucci about me.
you stay dissing me with your visions, ess-emm-h. but fine, i’ll let the girl go if it’ll stop the plague.
except i’m not tryna be the only one without a war prize. that’s so mid.
y’all gotta hook me up with some replacement loot or i might just come for your goodies.”

achilles, side-eyeing him, is like: “my guy, most of the good stuff from sacked cities is doled out.
you know we don’t keep a stash of spares. you want your own big bag, wait till we wreck troy. we’ll triple your cut then.”
but agamemnon’s not having it: “nah, you can’t hustle me. if i release this baddie without some new perk, i’ll just snatch one of yours, maybe ajax’s or odysseus’s, or maybe even yours, achilles. gotta keep my aura high.”

achilles is like, “bro, you’re so cringe.
i didn’t come out here to settle trojan beef personally—they never messed with my hometown, never scammed my cattle.
i’m just here to help you get menelaus’s wifey back. but all you do is disrespect me.
i’m the one racking up the kills, and you’re out here claiming all the prime loot.
i’m finna dip back to phthia, better to bounce than let you keep stepping on me. you can get rekt without me.”

agamemnon’s all, “fine, run home if you want, i’m not begging. i’ve got other homies.
you’re the most toxic king under zeus, no lie, always fighting. if the gods made you savage, that’s on them.
still, i’ll show you who’s boss: i’ll send your boo-thang brisēis away from you. that’ll prove i outrank you, and no one else can front.”

achilles nearly draws his blade, raging, about to do this dude in for real,
but goddess athena swoops down, sent by white-armed hera (cuz the gods are big fans of drama but don’t want blood yet).
she grabs achilles by his hair like “chill, bestie, stow the sword. use your words, not your blade. you’ll get triple the payoff later if you hold your anger.”
achilles takes a deep breath, slams his sword back in the sheath, telling her, “ugh, i hear you, goddess. guess i’ll wait to pop off.”

so achilles drags agamemnon verbally, calling him a wine-bloated coward with the eyes of a dog, heart of a deer,
who never hits the front lines but stays comfy taking others’ spoils.
he throws down his scepter in the dust, spitting oaths that someday all achaia’s gonna see how much they needed him,
and they’ll cry about it when he’s gone.

then the old wise man nestor tries to defuse the situation,
reminiscing about the epic heroes he used to vibe with back in the day, who were next-level savage compared to these men.
he pleads both dudes to calm down: “agamemnon, don’t yank away the girl from achilles; achilles, don’t disrespect the king so viciously.
both of you need to quit the toxic era.”

agamemnon, still proud, says, “nestor, you speak sense, but achilles wants to be #1 of all of us, which is big sus to me.
he better watch that mouth. if the gods made him an epic warrior, that’s no pass to roast me.”

achilles, rolling his eyes, basically goes, “i ain’t your servant. keep your commands for your other yes-men.
i’m not fighting over a girl. you can have her if you dare—try to snatch anything else that’s mine, though, you catch these hands.”

the meeting ends. achilles storms off to his tent with patrokles and his squad,
while agamemnon preps a black ship for chrysēs’s daughter—sends her back with a big sacrifice for apollo, led by cunning odysseus.
meanwhile, the men keep washing away their sins and burning prime bulls and goats for apollo on the beach.

then agamemnon orders the heralds to go to achilles’ tent to collect brisēis,
warning, “if he denies me, i’ll roll up with a crew and get her myself. bet.”
the heralds are shook, but they gotta do it, so they walk up, awkward as hell.
achilles sees them, sighs, “y’all are just messengers. i ain’t mad at you. patrokles, hand the girl over. i won’t clown these guys for doing their job.”
so they take brisēis away, and achilles just stares at the endless sea, tears in his eyes, praying to his mom, the sea-nymph thetis:

“ma, you said i’d be short-lived but also supremely honored. guess that was cap.
agamemnon just humiliated me hardcore. i’m pressed. do something.”
deep under the waves, thetis hears and rises up like sea-mist,
cradling her boy’s head, asking, “why the tears, baby? tell me everything.”

achilles vents the entire fiasco—how they sacked thebes, how chrysēs came for his daughter,
how apollo rained plague, how they’re returning the daughter but snatching brisēis from him.
he begs thetis to plead with zeus so the trojans start racking up dubs,
that way the achaian leaders realize they messed up benching their star player.

thetis cries too, “why did i birth you just to watch you struggle? your life is short and also savage.
stay out of the fight for a while. i’ll go talk to zeus when he’s back from chilling with the ethiopians.
on day twelve, he’ll be home on olympus, and i’ll kneel at his feet to get your rep back.”

achilles stays by the beach, ghosting the war. odysseus sails to chrysē with the girl and the sacrifice,
arriving in a deep harbor, lowering sails, making offerings, returning chrysēs’s daughter,
praying to apollo to let the plague vanish.
they butcher the bulls and goats, roast the meat, feast, and vibe all day, singing paean to the archer god.
when night falls, they crash on the ship, then at dawn they catch a favorable wind back to the achaian camp.

achilles keeps sulking in his tent with no chills, refusing to show up for assemblies or battles, letting his heart burn with anger.
day after day passes until the twelfth dawn, when the gods come back to olympus in squad formation.
thetis doesn’t forget her promise, rises early to find wide-browed zeus on the highest peak.
she clings to his knees, begs him to elevate her son, to let the trojans push the achaian line back so they realize how they dissed the best warrior.

zeus, silent for a while, eventually nods in that unstoppable, cosmic way that shakes all olympus.
thetis dives back into the sea, and zeus returns to his throne among the gods.
hera spots everything and is big salty that zeus made deals behind her back with the sea-nymph.
they bicker, zeus telling her to hush or risk major consequences,
until hephaestus calms the tension, handing his mom a cup, cracking jokes so everyone can relax.

the day ends with the gods feasting at that cosmic rooftop party,
apollo strumming the lyre, the muses trading bars so sweet.
later, the sun dips, each deity heads to their heavenly crib,
and zeus, the thunder-lord, goes to his bed, which he shares with queenly hera when sweet sleep claims him.

and that’s how book one wraps, with achilles raging in his lonely tent, apollo’s wrath turned down,
and the seeds of major heartbreak for achaia, all because two alpha dudes just couldn’t vibe.
