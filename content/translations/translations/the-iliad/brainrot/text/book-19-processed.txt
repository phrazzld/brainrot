yooo, saffron-shawl dawn drifted up from ocean's edge,
spreading that golden glow for gods and mortals both.
silver-footed thetis rolled up at the ships,
bearing the bright gear forged by the goat hephaestus.

she found achilles, tears streaming as he cradled pat's cold form,
and the myrmidons round him, heads bowed in gloom.
softly, that radiant goddess laid a hand on his shoulder, speaking low:
“child, we can’t revive him, for even gods have bounds.
so let your friend lie though your heart's all shattered.
meanwhile, accept these fresh kills from hephaestus—
no mortal's worn better steel. strap up and show out.”

she spread the gear before him, and each hammered plate sang
like thunder rumbling at olympus, so fierce the squad froze.
but achilles, eyes blazing, locked on that divine drip.
his rage climbed higher: his stare flared like hidden embers.
he fondled the gleaming shield, the helm's fierce crest,
then, voice rough, he turned to his mother:

“ma, these are insane, better than mortal craft for sure,
but pat’s body—i hate to think him rotting,
flies nesting in his wounds. can you keep him fresh
till i shred some trojans and come back for the rites?”

thetis, silver-footed, brushed his cheek:
“trust me. no fly dares his flesh while i stand guard.
he’ll rest unspoiled all year if needed.
but you—call the assembly, drop that old beef
with a-ga, the shepherd of men, so you can rock this armor
and re-enter the fray. let them see the swift one unleashed.”

she poured sweet ambrosia through patroclus’s nose,
to keep his form from decay and the creeping stench.
achilles then stomped along the surf,
howling so loud the achaeans formed ranks—
sailors and stewards too, all drawn by his cry.
odysseus and diomedes leaned on their spears,
still raw from their wounds, and last arrived a-ga,
clutching the spear-scar given by a trojan blade.

achilles rose, unbroken by tears but boiling with wrath:
“agamemnon, you see how useless that fight was,
warring over a single babe. i wish artemis had
dropped her with an arrow the day i seized her city.
my rage let trojans stack Ws, and my own men paid in blood.
let’s bury that nonsense. i’m ready to shred trojans again—
any who dare come near my sphere.”

the achaeans cheered, relief in their hearts,
and a-ga answered from his seat:
“true, my friends, ate drove me insane; i blame zeus, moira,
all that swirl of fate. i’ll offer the gifts i promised,
and i swear i never laid a finger on briseis.
i’ll sacrifice right here if that’s what it takes
to prove i’m not capping.”

cunning odysseus stepped up next,
“bro, let’s not skip breakfast. you can’t fight trojans on empty.
once you’re fueled, see the gifts and hear the oath—
then we swarm the battlefield.”

agamemnon told talthybius: “fetch me a pig,”
and they brought out the loot: tripods gleaming,
horses fit for kings, lumps of gold,
seven skillful women plus briseis, prized for her face.
high lord a-ga drew his blade,
swore before zeus and all watchers:
“by the almighty, i never took her to my bed.”
he slit the pig’s throat, tossed it to the waves,
and the waves swallowed that sacrifice quick.

achilles, rage seething, spat:
“zeus, you let these mortal dramas swirl so thick.
i’m done talking. let’s break and gear up.
my spear’s thirsting for trojan blood.”

the gathering scattered; the myrmidons hauled the gifts
to achilles’s tent, stabling the horses,
while briseis mourned over patroclus’s corpse—
her tears fell like a broken stream, recalling his kindness.
the other captive women joined her sobbing chorus,
each remembering her own grief.

though the chiefs begged achilles to eat,
he refused, eyes burning with sorrow:
“no snack, no drink, not till i’ve avenged my friend.
my heart can’t swallow food while his body’s still undone.”

they left him then, silent under the weight of grief.
far on olympus, zeus turned to bright-eyed athena:
“child, go slip some ambrosia to that furious man,
lest hunger strike before he deals trojan destruction.”

athena dove like a hawk, gliding invisible,
and dripped immortal nectar within his chest.
the men pressed on, buckling bronze straps,
helms bright as a flurry of gleaming snow,
shields reflecting dawn’s glow, spears bristling.
the clang soared high, forging a sky-bound ring of war.
in their midst, achilles loomed, shining like no other,
teeth clenched, eyes lit as if by hidden flame.

the breastplate fit as if the smith of heaven sized it personally,
the shield radiant as a midnight moon,
his father’s ash spear hefted strong in his grip—
the weapon no other achaean could wave.

automedon and alkimos yoked xanthus and balius,
immortal war-horses the wind can’t outrun.
achilles seized the reins, savage hunger in his voice:
“xanthus, balius, don’t ditch me like you did pat.
bring me back safe when the day is won.”

granted a voice by white-armed hera, xanthus bowed his proud head:
“we’ll keep you safe this time, unstoppable one,
but the day of doom creeps near—blame the gods, not us.
apollo clipped patroclus; hector just reaped that gift.
we could outrun any breeze, but your fate stands set.”

the furies hushed the horse’s tongue,
achilles snarled in reply:
“i know i’m marked, but i’ll stack trojan corpses first.
fate be damned, i’ll fight.”

cracking his whip, he tore forward,
thirsting for trojan blood under the rising sun.
