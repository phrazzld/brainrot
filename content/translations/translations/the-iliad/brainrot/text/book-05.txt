yo muse, let's vibe on how pallas athena juiced up tydeus’s kid diomedes with savage hype and fearless heart,
so he'd flex as the real mvp among the argive homies and snatch big-time clout:
she lit him up so bright from his helmet and shield, legit like that late-summer star,
you know, the one shining extra sus after it’s scrubbed in the ocean’s drip—
that’s the energy dancing off diomedes’ head and shoulders rn, making him look op.
athena was like “go off, king,” so he rolled out to the thick of the brawl, where the scrum was super sweaty.

there was this trojan name-check: dares, loaded priest of hephaestus, father of two: phegeus and idaeus,
both cracked at every flavor of combat. these two homies squared up with diomedes,
rolling up in their chariot while d-man hopped it on foot. they closed in:
phegeus lobbed first, but his long-shadow spear flew wide past diomedes’ left shoulder.
tydeus’s kid snapped back, going full savage with the bronze: no whiff this time.
he pinned phegeus dead-center in the chest, yeeting him right off the chariot.
idaeus just straight dipped from the fancy platform, not even staying to hug his brother’s corpse—
and no lie, he probably would have gotten wrecked too, if hephaestus hadn’t ghosted him away under a magic cloak,
‘cause he was big pressed about an old man’s heartbreak—no father wants that meltdown.
so diomedes snagged their horses, told his homies to hustle them back to the hollow ships.

the trojans freaked, seeing one bro down and the other hitting the eject seat,
so the whole vibe got tense.
but then grey-eyed athena reached out and hollered at savage ares:
“ares, ares—bro of carnage, city-wrecker, how about we let these trojans and achaians keep smashing each other,
whichever side papa zeus wants to hype, that’s their luck. but you and me, let’s ghost out,
dodging big daddy’s wrath? no reason to stress.”

that’s how she coaxed slaughter-hungry ares out the fray, parked him by the scamander’s bank,
so the danaans started rolling the trojans, each leader snagging a big kill.
agamemnon the war-lord was first: he stomped the halizonian boss odios from his chariot—
a quick turn, the spear jammed him just between the shoulders and chest, and down he crashed.
next up, big-idomeneus nailed phaistos, borus’s kid from fertile tarne.
speared him on the right shoulder as he tried to mount up, dropping him hard, darkness swallowing him.
idoneneus’s homies stripped his gear.
menelaus nailed skamandrios, son of strophios, the epic huntsman, taught by goddess artemis herself to slay beasts in the forests—
but she sure didn’t help him now, no arrow magic was bailing him out.
so menelaus fed him a long spear right below the shoulder blades, it tore through his chest,
he faceplanted, armor rattling.
meriones clocked phereklos, the craft pro who got too cozy with athena’s spark,
he once built the fine ships for alexandros that basically triggered all this trojan downfall—
buddy didn’t get the memo from the gods, so fate said “gg.”
meriones caught him in the right butt cheek, savage angle that shot straight under the bone near the bladder.
down he howled, death covering him in gloom.

next, meges (that’s the pride of phyleus) murked pedaios, love-child of antenor,
raised kindly by the shining theano, who tried to treat him equal to the legit kids.
meges jammed a spear in the back of his skull so vicious it burst out the mouth—
he kissed the dirt, biting cold bronze in dust.
then eurypylos the son of euaimon took out hypsenor, the dope son of dolopion,
priest of scamandros, revered like a literal deity by trojan folks.
eurypylos slashed in chase mode, hacking that strong right arm off. it plopped down,
blood spattering the field, purple doom took him under.
so the lines kept grinding in the savage clash, but diomedes, you couldn’t even tell which side he was on:
the man was rampaging like a raging flash flood ripping through bridges after a monstrous downpour,
blasting farmland. no dam, no fences hold it in.
that’s how the trojan ranks scattered under tydeus’s boy, unstoppable even though outnumbered.

lykaon’s shining kid spotted him storming the plain, crumbling trojan lines,
immediately drew his bow to clap diomedes, and pinned him in the right shoulder,
the arrow punching through his breastplate and out the other side, painting his gear in blood.
lykaon’s kid hollered: “yo trojans, horse-taming legends, let’s go! i just tagged the top achaians’ stud,
i bet he can’t last that lethal shaft. big dub for me, courtesy of apollo’s hype from lycia.”

but no, the arrow didn’t break diomedes. he pulled back by his horses and chariot and said to sthenelos:
“bro, come through, yank this nasty arrow out my shoulder.”
so sthenelos hopped down, yanked it out, blood spattering the twisted tunic.
diomedes prayed: “listen, daughter of zeus, if you or dad ever had my back before,
roll up again for me. let me smoke that clown who just flexed on me with an arrow.
he’s all talk, says i won't see the sun’s light again. we’ll see.”
athena heard him, gave him super speed in arms and legs, stood near him, and said:
“fear not, d-man. i just juiced you with that fatherly fury tydeus had. i also cleared that war-fog from your eyes,
so you can tell mortal from god. don’t swing on any immortals, though—
except if aphrodite rolls up. you can cut her. no cap.”
then she dipped, and diomedes jumped back in the front lines, now triple-lion-mode.

so first he kills astynouos and hypeiron the shepherd of troops,
one with the spear under the nipple, the other with the big sword near the collarbone,
shoulder rolling off. left them both behind.
snatches off next: abant and polyeidos, sons of the old man eurydamas the dream-reader—
their old man predicted big things, but guess no disclaimers about diomedes’s blade.
then xanthos and thoon, shining sons of phainops, that old geezer with no other kids to inherit,
got dropped by diomedes. they gave up the ghost, father left in tears,
and some random cousins were about to divvy the estate.
then echamon and chromios, kids of king priam, riding one chariot,
he pounced like a lion onto calves in a wandering herd,
ripping them out of the car, stripped their gear, and gave the horses to his squad.
seeing him absolutely shred, aeneas—top trojan big shot—came looking for pandaros:
he found lykaon’s unstoppable son and said:
“bro, where’s your bow flex? you were bragging how nobody in lycia or here’s on your level with that arrow game.
pop off at that savage who’s humiliating us. maybe he’s mortal, or a god holding a grudge. either way, handle it.”

pandaros was like: “dude, that unstoppable is diomedes. i’ve already arrowed him and it did squat.
he’s got a god on retainer. i left my horses at home ‘cause i was worried about feeding them. big mistake.
i came on foot with my bow, but it’s worthless. i already shot menelaus and diomedes, both times drew blood but just made them mad.
if i get back home, i’m tossing this bow in the fire. worthless item.
but let’s team up with your horses, charge that savage, see if we can spear him to hades.”

aeneas: “cool. jump on my chariot, i got the best horse dna from anchises (he snagged them from laomedon).
you handle the spear, i’ll drive or vice versa. just hurry so we can sauce him.”
pandaros hopped in, aeneas took the reins.
sthenelos spotted them booking it and warned diomedes:
“dude, watch out, that’s pandaros, the arrow lord, plus aeneas, aphrodite’s son. let’s not get wrecked.”
diomedes gave him a side-eye: “bro, that’s cringe. i’m not dipping out. i got athena on my side.
i’ll smoke them or one of them might escape. but if i kill them both, you make sure to snag their sweet horses—
they come from zeus’s line, stolen by anchises. we want that loot.”
so they got close, pandaros teased first: “no arrow? i’ll try the spear,” and threw,
pinging diomedes’s shield, but it didn’t punch through. pandaros thought he had a kill.
diomedes was unbothered: “you missed. guess one of us is feeding the war-god blood.”
he flung his spear, guided by athena, nailing pandaros under the eye, busting through teeth,
the tip slicing his tongue and out the jaw. he fell off the chariot, shining gear clattering, soul gone.
aeneas hopped down to shield the body like a lion protecting its cub,
diomedes pried up a huge rock that two men today couldn’t lift, but he flexed it easy.
he chucked it right at aeneas’s hip, smashing the joint, snapping tendons.
aeneas collapsed, black night shading his eyes.
he’d be toast if aphrodite, his mommy, hadn’t come in, wrapping her white arms around him,
draping him in her shimmering robe so no achaians could stab him.
she tried to haul him from the war zone, but sthenelos followed diomedes’s plan—snagging the trojans’ fancy horses.
he gave them to deiopylos to drive back, while diomedes chased aphrodite, knowing she was a weak goddess,
not built for hardcore brawls like athena or enyo.
he lunged in the crowd, stabbing her delicate wrist with a savage thrust that tore her immortal flesh.
ichor dripped out, that sweet gore of gods who don’t eat bread or drink wine.
she screeched, dropping aeneas. apollo whisked him away in a dark mist,
so no achaian could jab him in the chest.
diomedes trolled her: “stay off the battlefield, zeus-daughter. ain’t it enough you trick mortal women?
step here again and you'll feel the freeze of war.”
she ran off trembling, iris whisked her away,
found ares, her bro, chilling with his spear propped on the sidelines.
aphrodite fell to her knees, begging: “bro, give me your gold-laced horses and take me back to olympus.
some mortal clown cut me, diomedes, he’d even square up with father zeus.”
ares let her hop on, iris grabbed the reins and whipped them upward.
they soared to olympus, iris unyoked them, fed them ambrosia,
while diodione cradled aphrodite, cooing: “which olympian jumped you? child, endure.
all us gods have felt mortal pain. ares was once chained by otus and ephialtes.
hera got sniped in the boob by heracles. hades took an arrow from that same heracles.
you gotta deal, kiddo. blame that troublemaker athena for spurring diomedes.”

meanwhile, diomedes still out here trying to kill aeneas. three times he charged and apollo bopped him away.
the fourth time, the far-shooter barked: “back off, mortal. know your place. we’re not the same species.”
so diomedes pulled back. apollo took aeneas to pergame, the trojan temple,
let artemis and leto nurse him back. he made a phantom aeneas to keep the fight going,
and ares, spurred by apollo, disguised himself as akamas, rallied the trojans,
filling them with fresh bloodlust.
sarpedon scolded hector for being a lazy guard: “bro, we came from far to help. we fight, you hide.
you claimed you didn’t need allies? yeah, right. man up or watch your city fall.”
hector felt the sting, jumped from his chariot, rallied troops to battle.
like a swirling dust wind over the fields, the trojans advanced, pumped by ares,
while hera and athena, seeing the achaians in trouble, geared up in heaven.
hera pulled up the gold-bridled horses, hebe fixed the wheels on that glorious chariot,
they soared down, parted the gates of heaven,
found zeus on olympus’s peak, hera asked if he’s cool with them punishing ares who’s messing stuff up.
zeus was like, “fine, do it, but bring athena. she’s best at humbling that psycho.”
so off they flew across the sky, landed by the trojan rivers, unleashed the horses,
then sped off like pigeons in human form to the thick of the clash.
hera amped the achaian lines with a voice like stentor’s fifty throats: “shame, argives!
when achilles was vibing here, trojans never dared push y’all to the ships. do better.”
she found diomedes chilling by his chariot, nursing that arrow wound.
she teased him: “guess you’re not your father’s son. tydeus was small but savage.
he came to thebes once, and i told him to chill, but he still challenged the cadmeians, beat them all easy.
and you? you just lying low, are you tired or spooked? that’s not the tydeus i recall.”
diomedes answered: “i know you, goddess. i’m just following your command not to fight the gods except aphrodite.
but ares is on the field, so i told the argives to back off. i can’t brawl ares.”
athena said: “nah, i got your back. let’s go jump that meltdown-lord ares. spew no fear.”
she shoved sthenelos aside, hopped in with diomedes, the axle groaning under the combined weight of a goddess and a hero.
athena seized the reins, driving straight for ares, who was in the midst of finishing off periphas.
ares saw them, dropped that kill in place, and lunged at diomedes.
he thrust first from above, but athena slapped the spear aside.
diomedes struck next, guided by athena, jamming the spear into ares’s gut where the belt meets flesh,
the blade ripping his fair skin.
ares roared as loud as nine or ten thousand men in a pitched brawl, scaring both armies.
he soared to the sky in a black storm, up to olympus, complaining to zeus, showing his immortal blood:
“dad, aren’t you pissed how these gods tear us up for mortals’ sake? your daughter’s nuts, she unleashed diomedes on me.
he stabbed aphrodite, then me. i’d be dead if i didn’t bail out.”
zeus glared: “stop whining, you double-cross. you always love blood and war. you get that from your mom hera.
still, you’re my son, so i’ll fix you. but if you were anyone else, you’d be rotting deep in tartarus by now.”
paiëon applied magic painkillers, healing the wound swift as curdled milk.
hebe bathed him, robed him, and he sat by zeus, bragging in his new drip.
hera and athena left the battlefield, job done, stopping the man-slaying fury of ares.
