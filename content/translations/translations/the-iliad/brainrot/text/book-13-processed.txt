zeus had just flexed on the trojans and basically gave hector the greenlight to roll up on the achaean ships,
then peaced out, letting them sweat it out by the hulls in that never-ending stress.
dude turned his shiny gaze away, checking out the horsemasters of thrace, the mysian squads rocking close-combat vibes,
the sweet milk-sipping crew of the abians, who were, lowkey, the nicest humans out there.
he let troy be for a hot minute, convinced none of the other gods would dip in to help or sabotage,
but POSEIDON (the sea-lord, the og wave-shaker) wasn't snoozing, bruh was on top of that next-level vantage.

he was posted high up on the wooded summit of samothrace, scanning the war vibes from a distance—
he saw the whole wide slopes of ida, priam's city, and the achaean ships parked by the shore.
he was feeling big sympathy for the greeks, 'cause trojans were pressuring them so savage,
and he was big mad at zeus for letting them catch Ls.

without skipping a beat, he stomped off that mountain—
the ground basically trembled under the immortal footsteps of poseidon.
dude took three strides, and on the fourth, he landed at aigai,
where his epic golden crib lay hidden in the deep sea, shining forever.
there he hitched up his bronze-shod horses, luscious manes braided with gold,
slapped on his golden drip, grabbed a well-forged gold whip,
then hopped on the chariot and rode the waves like it was a bouncy castle.
all the sea creatures recognized their king and parted in hype,
the ocean itself parted to make space for that unstoppable vibe.
the wheels didn't even get soggy, for real.
straight away, the sea-lord's horses carried him, blazing, to the achaean ships.

there's a big hollow cavern twixt tenedos and rocky imbros,
poseidon parked his stallions inside, fed them ambrosial feed,
and locked their ankles with unbreakable gold fetters, so they’d chill for the return ride.
then he marched into the achaean ranks.

trojans, swirling like a roaring flame or a raging whirlwind,
were thirsting to snatch the achaean ships, planning to wreck every big-name greek out there on the spot.
but the big wave boss poseidon was not about that life—he wanted to hype up the argive men.
disguised as calchas the prophet, he pulled up to the front lines,
first calling out to both ajaxes: “yo, big ajaxes, keep it 100 and save the squad—
we can't be folding 'cause of fear right now. the trojan onslaught is real, but we can hold 'em,
especially where that maniac hector is raging like he's got the cheat codes from zeus.
channel some god-tier courage, hold your ground, and rally the homies—
straight-up, you can push him back even if olympus itself hypes him.”

then poseidon bopped them on the shoulders with his staff, pouring savage might into their veins,
making their limbs so nimble, lowkey unstoppable.
he soared off like a hawk from a high crag chasing after smaller birds,
just like that, the earth-shaker vanished.

swift oïlean ajax clocked it first, nudging telamonian ajax:
“bro, that was definitely a god, not calchas—
my vibes are fired up for war. let's get sweaty.”
telamonian ajax was like, “same, bruh. my spear hand’s itching,
i’m lowkey craving a one-on-one with that trojan hottie hector.”

so they hyped each other while the sea-lord kept secretly urging more achaean squads to re-up their nerve.
the men near the ships were battered and depressed, eyes brimming, certain they'd get bodied.
poseidon cameo’d among 'em, resetting hearts, saying:
“teucer, leïtus, peneleos, thoas, deïpyrus, meriones, antilochus, you war dogs,
don’t lose your sauce—be ashamed if the trojans burn your clout.
you used to talk big about saving these ships; now is the time to prove it.
i get that the atreid king might've messed up earlier, but we can't just ghost the war for that.
the only fix is to ball out and patch stuff—no more slacking.
bend your minds to that good strategy. we are not scrubs.”

in a snap, the spirit of might returned, they formed ranks around the two ajaxes,
shields pressed to shields, helmet to helmet, warrior to warrior,
their horsehair crests brushing each other as they stood that tight—
spears locked forward, thirsting for chaos.

the trojans rolled in a wave under hector's lead, unstoppable,
like a wild boulder crashing down a mountain stream after heavy rains, unstoppable 'til it hits a flat plain—
that was hector's vibe, unstoppable until he met these dense phalanxes.
then he got jammed real quick by greek spears and swords slicing at him—
he had to step back, roaring to the trojans:
“don't wuss out, trojans and lycians—press them. cronus’s big boy, the thunder-lord, wants our dubs, i can feel it.”

with that, he boosted their morale. deïphobus charged in, but meriones pinned him in the arm,
the bull-hide shield saving him from a lethal blow. he jumped back in dread,
and meriones went for more weapons, raging about his broken spear.

the skirmish churned—teucer took down imbrius, mentor’s son, who had married priam’s daughter.
he yanked his spear out, and imbrius toppled like a big pine on a mountain slope,
armor rattling. teucer tried to strip him, but hector nearly skewered teucer with that shining spear—
it missed, nailing amphimachus instead.
hector lunged to snatch amphimachus's helmet, but giant ajax forced him back,
and the athenian chiefs carried amphimachus's body away, while the ajaxes hauled off imbrius.
little oïlean ajax, big mad, took off imbrius’s head and pitched it like a ball straight at hector’s feet.
poseidon saw his grandson fall and got real heated,
pushing forward to spur the greeks more, bringing the smoke to the trojans.

then idomeneus stepped up, that cretan warlord with the unstoppable drive.
he just parted ways with a wounded comrade but was still down to brawl,
and poseidon, disguised as thoas, goaded him: “where's the old cretan hype?
come on, let's wreck these trojans.”
idomeneus said, “we’re fighting like fiends, but maybe fate’s with the trojans right now. still, let’s hustle.”
poseidon nodded: “no mercy for any greeks who ghost this war. let's suit up, homie.”

so idomeneus hopped into his fierce gear, shining like lightning.
meriones, his ride-or-die, followed him to the front.
like ares flanked by phobos (fear) blazing out of thrace,
they advanced through the ranks, steel glinting.

meriones asked, “yo, where we diving in? left, middle, or right flank?”
idomeneus replied, “the middle's got big names—both ajaxes and teucer. they got that covered.
let's pivot left, see if we can claim some clout or feed the trojans their L.”

they marched out; the achaean crowd recognized that unstoppable glow.
the fight by the ships was savage. dust swirled under frantic feet,
helmets glared, fresh armors shimmered, shields glinted—
any normal soul would cringe, but real ones might get hyped.

zeus wanted trojans to keep climbing that scoreboard, partly to honor swift achilles,
but poseidon wasn't about to let the argives get fully bodied—he hated seeing them battered.
he was from the same father as zeus, but older bro had more clout.
still, poseidon snuck around in mortal disguise, stoking the greek fire.
and so the war looped on.

idomeneus slayed othryoneus, that wannabe who pledged to drive the greeks out so he could marry priam’s daughter.
idomeneus was like, “buddy, guess you won't fulfill that promise. come marry death instead.”
he dragged the corpse aside, but asius rushed in for backup—idomeneus snapped first,
caught asius in the neck with his spear, dropping him like a felled oak.
antilochus speared the charioteer, driving the trojan horses away.
deïphobus saw the carnage and roared, launching a spear at idomeneus, but missed—
hitting ascalaphus, ares’s son, dropping him cold.
the argives closed in around ascalaphus’s body while deïphobus tried to snatch a trophy helmet—
meriones jolted forward, stabbing him in the arm so the helmet crashed to the ground.

the trojans yanked him out, bleeding heavily, while the war roared on.
aeneas smoked aphareus with a swift blow to the neck. antilochus then downed thoön,
slicing his back’s main vein. blood spilled, and antilochus went in for the armor.
adamas tried to run antilochus through, but poseidon sapped the lethal thrust.
meriones saw adamas retreat, pegged him near the navel—
he flopped like a bull roped by farmers, thrashing in the dust 'til the spear got yanked out.

helenus whacked deïpyrus’s helmet, shattering it—deïpyrus's eyes rolled back.
menelaus got big angry, brandishing his spear, while helenus notched an arrow.
arrow flew wide from menelaus’s breastplate like chickpeas on a winnowing shovel in the breeze,
menelaus drilled helenus's hand, messing up the bow, forcing him back.
then peisander dashed at menelaus; menelaus missed, but peisander’s spear stuck in menelaus’s shield,
snapped off. he grinned, thinking he had him—then menelaus sliced him above the nose with a silver-studded sword,
caving in his face so the eyes popped onto the ground. menelaus placed a foot on his chest,
stripped the gear, and spat: “trojans, insatiable for war—stealing my wife and goods, disrespecting xenia—
zeus will punish you for real. y’all want to torch our ships? that’s whack. we’ll see who gets burned.”

harpalion, pylamenes’s son, tried a quick jab at menelaus but couldn't break the shield’s face,
retreated, looking around for safety, but meriones pegged him in the butt, arrow punching through the bladder.
he sank, black blood soaking the dust, his pals carrying him away in tears, with no ransom for his life.

paris got heated, 'cause harpalion was his homie from paphlagonia.
he shot an arrow at random and nailed euchenor, that wealthy corinthian who took fate into his own hands,
chose to die in war rather than rot from disease at home. arrow slammed under his jaw, lights out.

so the fight raged around the blazing clash of swords and spears,
but hector didn’t realize the trojans were taking hits on the left.
he was still forging forward where he first cracked the achaean lines,
by the ships of ajax and protesilaus.

there the boeotians, ionians in trailing tunics, locrians, phthians, and epeians tried to hold him off,
led by menestheus, phidas, stichius, bias, meges, amphion, and dracius.
then medon and podarkes from phylace joined, plus the speedster oïlean ajax stayed near the larger ajax,
like two oxen straining on a plow, shoulders sweating.
big ajax had enough men to swap with him when he got tired, but little ajax had no locrians for close combat,
'cause they were all archers with no fancy gear—still, they poured arrows to keep trojans at bay.

the trojans might’ve retreated right then if polydamas hadn’t stepped to hector, “bro, let's regroup.
you can't do everything yourself. rally the best, think up a plan, or the greeks will surge soon,
especially that unstoppable warrior we pissed off—achilles.”

hector actually listened, hopped off his chariot, telling polydamas, “hold it down. i’ll circle back.”
like a snow-capped peak bounding over the field, he dashed to find deïphobus, helenus, adamas, asius, or othryoneus,
but discovered them either dead or wounded.
finally he found paris, that heartbreak prince, urging the troops on.
hector snapped: “you pretty-boy fiasco, where are deïphobus, helenus, adamas, asius, or that weirdo othryoneus?
we're on the brink, man.”
paris answered, “chill, hector. some are gone, some are wounded. we’re all still hustling. let's go.
we got some fight left.”

so they rushed to where polydamas, cebrion, polymestes, phalces, orthaeus, polyphites, palmys, ascanius, morus, and all those trojan backups were surging in thick formation,
like storm-whipped waves hammered by father zeus’s thunder, piling crest on crest, unstoppable.
hector led them like ares incarnate, shield shining, helmet glimmering,
testing the greek lines, hoping they'd break. but the greeks stood firm.
telamonian ajax shouted: “hector, come closer if you want that smoke. you think you’ll burn our ships? nah, we still got hands.
your city might fall first, real talk.”

right then a hawk soared on the right side, a good omen for the greeks. they cheered.
hector shot back: “ajax, trash talk if you want, but i’m the chosen of zeus. watch me feed your flesh to trojan dogs.”

with that, the trojans roared behind him, the greeks answered with their own war-cry,
and the sound soared up under the bright sky of zeus.
