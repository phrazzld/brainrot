# T283: Create Simple Test Component to Verify React Testing Library Setup

## Problem Analysis

The task is to add a minimal React component test to verify that the testing infrastructure works correctly with React 19. After examining the existing test setup, I identified several key components:

1. A custom render function in `__tests__/utils/test-utils.tsx` specifically adapted for React 19
2. Jest configuration in `jest.config.cjs` with a custom babel transformer for React components
3. Setup file in `jest.setup.cjs` for DOM environment, mocking browser APIs, etc.
4. Existing component tests like `DownloadButton.test.tsx` using React Testing Library

The goal is to create a simple, standalone test that verifies the core React 19 testing functionality without depending on complex business logic or external services.

## Implementation Plan

I'll create a simple React component and a corresponding test file to verify React Testing Library works correctly with React 19. The approach will be:

1. Create a very simple React component (`SimpleTestComponent.tsx`) with basic functionality:
   - A button that increments a counter when clicked
   - Some text that changes based on the counter value
   - Basic styling to verify CSS handling

2. Create a test file (`SimpleTestComponent.test.tsx`) that tests:
   - Initial rendering
   - State changes after user interaction
   - Conditional rendering based on state
   - Basic styling/class application

3. Use the custom render function from `test-utils.tsx` to ensure React 19 compatibility

This will verify that the core React Testing Library functions work properly with our Jest setup.

## Success Criteria

- The test should pass without any errors or warnings
- The test should cover basic React functionality:
  - Component rendering
  - State management
  - Event handling
  - Conditional rendering
- The test should use the custom render function for React 19 compatibility
- The implementation should be simple enough to serve as a reference for future tests

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: React 19 rendering behavior differs from previous versions
  **Mitigation**: Use the custom render function that has been adapted for React 19

- **Risk**: Testing environment missing required DOM APIs
  **Mitigation**: Verify that all required browser APIs are properly mocked in the test environment

- **Risk**: Styling-related tests might be brittle
  **Mitigation**: Focus on class names rather than actual styles to avoid environment-specific issues
