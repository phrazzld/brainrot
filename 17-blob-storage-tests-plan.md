# Plan for Writing Tests for Blob Storage Access

## Current State Analysis

We already have some test coverage for Blob storage access:
- `__tests__/utils/getBlobUrl.test.ts` - Tests for URL generation functions
- `__tests__/utils/fallbackMechanism.test.ts` - Tests for the fallback mechanism
- `__tests__/utils/services/BlobService.test.ts` - Tests for the BlobService class

However, we need to ensure comprehensive coverage across all Blob storage functionality to ensure robustness during the migration and beyond.

## Test Coverage Needed

1. **BlobService Unit Tests**
   - Test all methods of the BlobService class
   - Test error handling for each method
   - Test edge cases (empty files, large files, special characters in paths)

2. **BlobPathService Unit Tests**
   - Test path conversion logic
   - Test edge cases with special characters and unusual paths
   - Test pattern matching for different asset types

3. **Utility Function Tests**
   - Test URL generation and caching
   - Test fallback mechanisms
   - Test existence checks

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction with Vercel Blob API
   - Test fallback mechanisms in real components
   - Test error recovery

## Implementation Approach

1. **Enhance existing unit tests**
   - Review existing tests and identify gaps
   - Add test cases for missing functionality
   - Improve mocking of external services

2. **Create new BlobPathService tests**
   - Test path conversion logic thoroughly
   - Test with a variety of input path formats

3. **Create integration tests**
   - Set up test environment with mock responses
   - Test real components with the BlobService integration

4. **Test error scenarios**
   - Network failures
   - Invalid paths
   - Access permission issues
   - Rate limiting

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `__tests__/utils/services/BlobPathService.test.ts` for testing path conversion
2. Enhance `__tests__/utils/services/BlobService.test.ts` with more comprehensive tests
3. Create integration tests for components using Blob storage
4. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Create test utilities for common testing patterns
