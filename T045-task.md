## Title: COMPLEX - Address technical debt in test files

## Original Ticket Text:

- [ ] **T045: COMPLEX - Address technical debt in test files**
  - [ ] Reorganize test mocks for better type safety:
    - [ ] Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all mocked services
    - [ ] Update jest mocks to use type-safe mock implementations
    - [ ] Standardize mock creation and initialization
  - [ ] Refactor test file structure to improve organization:
    - [ ] Group tests by functionality rather than implementation details
    - [ ] Create shared test utilities with proper typing
  - [ ] Improve test assertions with type safety:
    - [ ] Replace any types with proper interfaces
    - [ ] Use type predicates where appropriate
  - [ ] Dependencies: T039, T043

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

For task T045, we need to systematically address technical debt in test files across the codebase. This task focuses on improving test organization, type safety, and standardization.

Please help me:

1. Assess the current state of test files in the codebase:

   - Identify common patterns of mock usage
   - Find instances of 'any' types and type assertions
   - Understand the current test file organization
   - Locate shared test utilities if they exist

2. Design a comprehensive approach to address these issues:

   - Define TypeScript interfaces for all mocked services
   - Create standardized factory functions for mock creation
   - Develop type-safe assertion utilities
   - Plan a reorganization of test files by functionality

3. Prioritize the work based on impact and complexity:

   - Identify quick wins versus more complex refactoring
   - Consider which changes would improve developer experience
   - Determine if certain tests should be prioritized (e.g., critical services)

4. Create a detailed implementation plan with:

   - Specific files to modify
   - New interfaces and utilities to create
   - Testing strategy for the changes
   - Approach to maintain backward compatibility

5. Consider potential risks and mitigations:
   - How to avoid breaking existing test functionality
   - Strategies for incremental implementation
   - Validation approach to ensure changes are effective
