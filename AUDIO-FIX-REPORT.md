# Audio URL Loading Fix Report

## Issue
The audio files in the reading room were not loading correctly due to a URL formation issue. The specific error was:

```
Error: Failed to fetch https://82qos1wlxbd4iq1g.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/https://82qos1wlxbd4iq1g.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/books/the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3: 404 ()
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Double URL Prefixing**: The audioSrc URLs in translations were already complete Blob storage URLs, but the reading room component was treating them as relative paths and applying `getAssetUrlWithFallback`, which prepended another Blob storage URL.

2. **URL Format Inconsistency**: The audio files in Blob storage use a different path format than specified in translations:
   - Actual storage path: `https://82qos1wlxbd4iq1g.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3`
   - Path in translations: `/the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3` (which was getting incorrectly converted)

3. **AbortController Issues**: The component had issues with the cleanup of AbortController signals, leading to errors when navigating between chapters.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Direct URL Generation
Created a helper function in translations/index.ts to generate direct audio URLs:

```typescript
const getDirectAudioUrl = (bookSlug: string, filename: string): string => {
  // Use the tenant-specific base URL that's working in verification
  const baseUrl = 'https://82qos1wlxbd4iq1g.public.blob.vercel-storage.com';
  return `${baseUrl}/${bookSlug}/audio/${filename}.mp3`;
};
```

### 2. Updated URL Usage in Reading Room
Modified the reading room component to directly use the audioSrc from translations without additional URL conversion:

```typescript
// Instead of:
getAssetUrlWithFallback(chapterData.audioSrc)
  .then(audioUrl => {
    ws.load(audioUrl);
  })

// We now use:
ws.load(chapterData.audioSrc);
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling and AbortController management to prevent errors during navigation:

- Added proper try/catch blocks around audio loading
- Added checks for signal.aborted before updating state
- Implemented proper named event handlers with removal on cleanup

### 4. Consistent URL Format
Updated all audio URLs in translations to use the direct format that was verified to work:

```typescript
// Instead of:
audioSrc: getAssetUrl('/the-iliad/audio/book-01.mp3', USE_BLOB_STORAGE)

// We now use:
audioSrc: getDirectAudioUrl('the-iliad', 'book-01')
```

## Affected Books
The fix applies to all books with audio files:
1. The Iliad (24 chapters)
2. The Odyssey (24 chapters)
3. The Aeneid (12 chapters)
4. Hamlet (1 chapter)
5. The Declaration of Independence (1 chapter)

## Verification
The audio files now load and play correctly in the reading room. The correct URLs are used and no 404 errors are occurring.

## Future Considerations
1. Consider implementing a more robust URL normalization mechanism in the getBlobUrl utility
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for audio loading failures
3. Create automated tests for audio URL resolution
