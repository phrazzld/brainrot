# T273: Configure Prettier/ESLint Integration to Avoid Conflicts

## Task Description
Configure the integration between ESLint and Prettier to avoid conflicts, ensuring they work together harmoniously rather than having overlapping or contradictory rules.

## Implementation Approach
1. Examine the current ESLint and Prettier configurations
2. Update the ESLint configuration to properly integrate with Prettier
3. Install any missing plugins needed for import ordering
4. Test the integration to ensure conflicts are resolved

## Expected Changes
1. Update `.eslintrc.json` to:
   - Extend `prettier` configuration
   - Configure eslint-plugin-prettier if needed
   - Disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier

2. Fix the importOrder warning we observed in the Prettier configuration:
   - Install the appropriate plugin (likely `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`)
   - Update the Prettier configuration to use the plugin correctly

## Implementation Steps
1. Read current ESLint and Prettier configurations
2. Research the required plugins for import sorting
3. Install any necessary plugins
4. Update ESLint configuration
5. Test the integration
6. Document the final configuration
