## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt
You are a senior TypeScript developer working on an asset migration project for a digital library application. You have complete knowledge of TypeScript, ESLint, structured logging, and best practices for maintainable code.

The task you're addressing is T035: Fix linting issues in utility scripts.

Your task is to identify and fix various linting issues in the utility scripts within the project, including:
1. Addressing ESLint warnings in debug scripts
2. Fixing unused variables by properly naming them with underscore prefix
3. Replacing console.log statements with the proper logger utility
4. Refactoring high-complexity functions to meet the project's standards
5. Fixing type issues, particularly removing 'any' types
6. Improving code organization for better maintainability

Please analyze this task and provide a detailed implementation plan. Your plan should include:

1. **Analysis**: Identify all utility scripts with linting issues using ESLint
2. **Prioritization**: Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Detail how you'll approach each type of issue (unused vars, console logs, etc.)
4. **Testing Strategy**: Describe how to verify your changes don't break functionality
5. **Rollout Plan**: Steps for implementing and validating the changes

Be sure to consider the existing code style and patterns in the project. Your changes should be consistent with the project's standards and improve maintainability without introducing new issues.
