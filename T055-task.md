## Title
Complete TypeScript module resolution fixes (Phase 2)

## Original Ticket Text
```markdown
- [ ] **T055: Complete TypeScript module resolution fixes (Phase 2)**
  - [ ] Systematically fix all remaining module imports:
    - [ ] Create an automated script to add .js extensions to all imports
    - [ ] Apply fixes to all test files
    - [ ] Apply fixes to all utility modules
    - [ ] Apply fixes to all service files
  - [ ] Ensure all path aliases are consistently used
  - [ ] Run full type-checking to verify all issues are resolved
  - [ ] Add ESLint rule to enforce correct import patterns
  - Dependencies: T054
```

## Implementation Approach Analysis

This task requires a systematic approach to fixing TypeScript module resolution issues across the codebase. Building on the foundation established in T054, we need to:

1. **Understand the scope**: How many files need to be modified? What patterns need to be fixed?
2. **Create an automation strategy**: Should we use a script or existing tools?
3. **Design a systematic approach**: What order should we apply fixes? How do we validate?
4. **Consider dependencies**: How will changes impact other parts of the codebase?
5. **Ensure safety**: How do we prevent regressions and ensure changes are correct?

The task has technical challenges (TypeScript module resolution, path management) and scale challenges (potentially hundreds of files to modify).
