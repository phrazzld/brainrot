# T041: Fix Type Compatibility Issues in Verification Scripts

## Problem Overview

The verification scripts were experiencing type compatibility issues with the `Chapter` interface:

- In translations/types.ts, `audioSrc` is defined as `string | null`
- But verification scripts expected it to be `string | undefined`
- This caused TypeScript errors in:
  - verifyAudioMigration.ts (line 181)
  - verifyAudioMigrationWithContent.ts (line 231)
  - verifyBlobStorage.ts (line 231)

## Solution Implemented

1. Created an adapter utility to solve the type compatibility issue:

   - Added a new file: `utils/migration/TranslationAdapter.ts`
   - Created `VerificationChapter` and `VerificationTranslation` interfaces with compatible types
   - Implemented adapter functions to convert between types:
     - `adaptChapter()`: Converts `string | null` to `string | undefined`
     - `adaptTranslation()`: Converts entire Translation objects

2. Updated the verification scripts to use the adapter:

   - Added imports for the adapter functions
   - Used `adaptTranslation()` to convert book objects before verification
   - Fixed module imports to use namespace imports for Node.js built-ins

3. Fixed ES module issues in all three scripts:
   - Replaced `import.meta.url` checks with CommonJS-compatible `require.main === module`
   - This ensures compatibility with the project's module system and TypeScript configuration

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: The scripts now properly handle the type differences without TypeScript errors.
2. **Non-Intrusive**: We didn't have to change the core `Chapter` interface in translations, preserving backward compatibility.
3. **Maintainability**: The adapter pattern provides a clear, reusable solution for handling similar issues in the future.
4. **Documentation**: The adapter interfaces include clear documentation about their purpose.

## Additional Changes

While working on the type compatibility issues, we also made the following improvements:

- Fixed import statements for Node.js built-ins (fs, path) to use namespace imports
- Updated main module detection to be more compatible with the TypeScript configuration

All three verification scripts now compile without TypeScript errors related to the Chapter interface.
