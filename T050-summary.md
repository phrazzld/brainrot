# T050: Improve Test Fixtures and Type Safety in Tests

## Summary

This task focused on improving the type safety and organization of test fixtures across the codebase. The following changes were implemented:

### 1. Created Type-Safe Fixture Factories

- Created dedicated `fixtures` directory with domain-specific factories:

  - `books.ts` - Fixtures for books and chapters
  - `assets.ts` - Fixtures for assets (audio, text, image)
  - `responses.ts` - Fixtures for API responses

- Implemented type-safe factory functions:

  - `createBookFixture` - Creates book test data with type-safe overrides
  - `createChapterFixture` - Creates chapter test data with type-safe overrides
  - `createAssetFixture` - Creates asset test data with type-safe overrides
  - `createTextAssetFixture` - Specialized fixture for text assets
  - `createAudioAssetFixture` - Specialized fixture for audio assets
  - `createImageAssetFixture` - Specialized fixture for image assets
  - `createResponseFixture` - Creates type-safe Response objects

- Added builder pattern for complex objects:
  - `BookBuilder` - Fluent builder for creating complex book structures

### 2. Enhanced Test Assertion Utilities

- Improved existing assertion utilities with better generic typing:

  - Updated `expectCalledWithObjectContaining` with better type safety
  - Enhanced `expectLoggedWithContext` to use generic types
  - Added `expectValidAssetUrl` for asserting URL structure
  - Added type predicates like `isString`, `isNumber`, etc.
  - Added `expectResponseProperties` for response validation

- Made return types more specific:
  - Updated `expectObjectShape` to be a type assertion function

### 3. Improved Response Mocking

- Created consolidated response fixtures:

  - `createResponseFixture` - Base function for creating type-safe Response objects
  - `createTextResponse` - Creates text responses
  - `createJsonResponse` - Creates JSON responses
  - `createErrorResponse` - Creates error responses
  - `createSuccessFetch` - Creates fetch functions returning success responses
  - `createErrorFetch` - Creates fetch functions returning error responses

- Added specialized fetch utilities:
  - `createNetworkError` - Creates network error simulation
  - `createNetworkErrorFetch` - Creates fetch functions that throw network errors

### 4. Updated Test Files

- Refactored `fetchTextWithFallback.alternate.test.ts` to use the new fixtures and utilities:
  - Replaced manual Response creation with `createTextResponse` and `createErrorResponse`
  - Used `createTextAssetFixture` for asset data
  - Used `expectFetchCalledWith` and `expectValidAssetUrl` for assertions
  - Removed type assertions (`as unknown as Response`)

### 5. Added Documentation and Examples

- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive documentation:

  - Detailed information about fixture usage
  - Example code for different test scenarios
  - Best practices for test implementation
  - Migration guide for updating existing tests

- Created example file demonstrating best practices:
  - `fixture-usage-example.ts` shows practical usage of all utilities

## Benefits

1. **Improved Type Safety**: Eliminated `as unknown as X` type assertions in tests
2. **Consistent Test Data**: Standardized approach to creating test fixtures
3. **Better DX**: More intuitive and discoverable test utilities
4. **Simplified Mocking**: Easy-to-use factories for common test scenarios
5. **Better Maintainability**: Consolidated duplicate implementations

## Future Work

While this task significantly improves test utilities, there are opportunities for further enhancements:

1. Gradually migrate all existing tests to use the new fixtures
2. Add more domain-specific assertions for common test patterns
3. Consider adding snapshot testing utilities
4. Further enhance the builder patterns for other complex objects
