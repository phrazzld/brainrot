# T218: Git Removal of Asset Directory Structure - Completion Report

## Summary
Task T218 has been successfully completed. The public/assets directory structure has been removed from the Git repository while preserving important files, and the directory has been added to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked in the future.

## Actions Taken

1. **Preserved Important Files**
   - Identified and preserved key files before removal:
     - README.md with brainrot translation context -> moved to docs/assets-reference/
     - extract_chapters.py script -> moved to docs/assets-reference/
     - Iliad introduction and translator's preface -> moved to docs/assets-reference/

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added public/assets/ to .gitignore to prevent directory from being tracked in the future

3. **Removed Assets Directory from Git**
   - Used `git rm -r public/assets` to remove the directory and its contents from the repository
   - Removed 176 files from the git repository

4. **Updated TODO.md**
   - Marked task T218 as complete

## Notes and Observations
- The physical files will remain on the filesystem for local development, but won't be tracked by git
- The application should continue to function correctly as it now uses Blob URLs for all assets
- Important reference files have been preserved in the docs/assets-reference directory

## Verification
- The assets directory has been successfully removed from git tracking
- Important files have been preserved in a new location
- The .gitignore file has been updated to exclude the assets directory in the future
